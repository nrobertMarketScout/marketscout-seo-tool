WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.560
All right. There we go. All right, guys. Welcome to the call. November 5th election day. Wow.

00:08.560 --> 00:14.760
Here we go. Got two months left in the year. First and foremost, just to get really, we're

00:14.760 --> 00:18.560
going to get right into it today. But one thing I wanted to say is I wanted to thank

00:18.560 --> 00:24.200
everybody who was part of our beta test group. We appreciate you guys. I'm going to be bringing

00:24.200 --> 00:29.400
Ryan on here in a second. We appreciate you guys putting trust in the product and knowing

00:30.360 --> 00:36.360
we'll make sure that it's a great product. We're trying to implement. I'm giving Ryan feedback. I

00:36.360 --> 00:40.280
hear you guys. I have my team working on it. We're trying to get as much feedback as possible.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.480
It's not going to be perfect, but we're going to work our way towards it. We're going to allow you

00:43.480 --> 00:51.320
guys to help us build this tool. And I'm going to be able to help take your feedback, give it to

00:51.320 --> 00:56.360
Ryan, and create the best rank and rent tool on the internet. Okay? So anyway, I wanted to

00:56.360 --> 00:59.880
let you guys know that we appreciate you guys being part of that beta test group.

01:01.160 --> 01:06.840
And yeah, that's basically all I wanted to say before I bring Ryan on. I'm going to bring Ryan

01:06.840 --> 01:12.840
Dalton, Mr. $87,000 per month. If you guys do not know Ryan Dalton, maybe you just joined the group.

01:12.840 --> 01:19.320
Ryan joined back a little over two years ago and has scaled up to $87,000 per month. He is a master

01:19.320 --> 01:26.200
of systems. He's a master of organization. And this was a perfect project for him to take all

01:26.200 --> 01:31.640
of his skill sets and put it into creating the perfect tool, the only tool that you need.

01:31.640 --> 01:36.520
And today, specifically, we're going to be talking about search volume and what the minimum search

01:36.520 --> 01:42.040
volume needs to be for you to have confidence to go into a city, any niche. And on top of that,

01:42.040 --> 01:46.440
we're also going to be answering questions, going into more of the tool itself for any of you guys

01:46.440 --> 01:50.360
that had questions. I know we had the call earlier. I guess it was last night for you guys. It was

01:50.360 --> 01:55.000
earlier today for me, and we had a bunch of really, really good questions. So any questions that you

01:55.000 --> 01:59.320
have related to the software we want to answer, clear up, et cetera. We're going to talk about

01:59.320 --> 02:02.920
search volume. And then if we have any time for anything else, we'll do that as well. So let me

02:02.920 --> 02:09.800
bring Ryan on really quick and we will get going. Hold on. Three, two, one, admits.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.960
And apparently, oh, there we go. We're working.

02:13.960 --> 02:26.440
Yo. Can you hear me? Yeah, I got you. Beautiful. Okay. Ryan Dalton. Welcome to the call, dude.

02:28.120 --> 02:33.800
Hey, everybody. Yeah, I know some people that they were on the call that was for me this morning.

02:33.800 --> 02:40.280
This has been the longest day of my life. I got two hours and 11 minutes of sleep, exactly per

02:40.280 --> 02:46.360
the watch here, per the whoop, two hours, 11 minutes. But I did get a little nappy on the couch.

02:46.360 --> 02:53.080
Good to be back. We had Ryan on a few times and you guys should know who he is. If not, then you

02:53.080 --> 02:57.880
guys need to be a little more active in the group. Mr. $87,000 per month joined a little over two

02:57.880 --> 03:05.080
years ago, full-time job, family, kids, the entire thing, all the objections that people used to have

03:06.040 --> 03:10.600
don't have time. I've got kids, blah, blah, blah. Ryan basically ruined that for all of you guys

03:10.600 --> 03:15.160
because he's got all of those objections and he still did it. So anytime anyone tells me any of

03:15.160 --> 03:18.520
these things, I just send them the interview with Ryan. I'm like, well, this guy did it. So it's

03:18.520 --> 03:23.320
possible, which means it's possible for you. So what we're going to do today, guys, as I mentioned,

03:24.040 --> 03:29.400
I want to get right into this. I want to specifically talk about search volume because

03:29.400 --> 03:33.480
it's something that we've been talking about. We haven't been putting it off, but I've really

03:33.480 --> 03:39.080
wanted to make sure we get it dialed in so that we don't give you guys bad advice or something

03:39.080 --> 03:43.960
I'm not a hundred percent confident in. So over the past few weeks, since we launched this tool,

03:43.960 --> 03:48.280
what's it been, Ryan, four and a half weeks, something like that? Yeah, about four and a half

03:48.280 --> 03:53.800
weeks. I've been going in looking at not just one of my projects, but I've looked at like four or

03:53.800 --> 03:59.080
five, six of my projects that are ranking very well consistently for years, looking at how many

03:59.080 --> 04:03.640
leads they have. They're ranked really high, looking at what the tool says to them and then

04:03.640 --> 04:12.920
saying, okay, if I was to make a guess, what's the minimum search volume that a city and niche has to

04:12.920 --> 04:19.560
have? Okay. So anyway, Ryan, anything that you want to cover before we get started on that front

04:19.560 --> 04:26.040
or anything that you want to chat on other than that? I just think it's a super important call.

04:26.040 --> 04:31.880
This stuff is not static. I mean, it changes over time. So revisiting some of the fundamentals of

04:31.880 --> 04:36.920
local lead generation is always a great way to spend some time. Search volume I've found

04:36.920 --> 04:43.560
more and more with my agency is king, right? Where everything for me begins with search volume. So

04:44.280 --> 04:49.080
having conversations about what people see as working and what isn't is very useful.

04:50.040 --> 04:57.480
And search volume, guys, it's part of due diligence. And I will stand by this forever.

04:58.120 --> 05:04.120
Due diligence is the most important step in the process, right? Because no matter how good you

05:04.120 --> 05:11.240
are at sales, if you do a bad job on picking an area and there's no hungry business owners,

05:11.240 --> 05:15.400
your life becomes very difficult. If you pick a really good city that's low competition,

05:15.480 --> 05:21.080
great search volume, lots of hungry business owners, you could be a mediocre at best salesman,

05:21.080 --> 05:27.480
not even a good salesperson, and you're going to get deals. So I truly believe that due diligence

05:27.480 --> 05:31.160
is actually the most important step in the process. And this is part of due diligence. Now,

05:32.040 --> 05:37.560
I did notice that there was a couple other questions like what about this, that, and the

05:37.560 --> 05:45.080
rest. Some of those things, if we don't know the exact, we don't have a very solid answer yet per

05:45.080 --> 05:50.200
the tool, because this is going to be our staple tool going forward, then I'm going to let you guys

05:50.200 --> 05:56.600
know that. But specifically on search volume, we are going to address that today. Okay? So

05:57.400 --> 06:02.840
really quick, though, just to welcome people in the call, we've got Simon, we've got Nicholas

06:02.840 --> 06:08.600
Kudlick, we've got Beau, we've got Kevin Mijo, we've got Corey Gilbert, Mr. St. George Utah,

06:08.600 --> 06:17.800
Ryan Martez, we've got JC Crozier, what's going on? We've got Jason Allred, Mr. Utah, Ryan,

06:17.800 --> 06:23.320
the best example of F your excuses, a hundred percent. Corey says, Ryan Dalton, I have that

06:23.320 --> 06:29.080
same safe. If you want to go shoot some Tannerite, let me know. Dude, let's go. Let's go, man. I put

06:29.080 --> 06:35.960
some 556s and Tannerite with you. You guys and your Tannerite, dude. You know, it's funny. I

06:35.960 --> 06:40.840
actually met Corey in person and we actually had the same conversation about Tannerite. So

06:41.480 --> 06:46.840
I have a feeling he's got a few stacks of that stuff. It's good to have someone stand by. Yeah,

06:46.840 --> 06:53.480
you have to. You have to. Okay. So guys, let's start with this. I want to start with how we

06:53.480 --> 07:02.360
used to recommend the search volume. Okay. Now I want to go very basic. Search volume. And Ryan,

07:02.360 --> 07:07.960
I know that for you, you do look at population a little bit. You've kind of kind of a slightly

07:07.960 --> 07:14.920
different process. But for me, I kind of just go sheer like basically almost exclusively off of

07:15.640 --> 07:20.440
search volume, because in my mind, it doesn't really matter. I do think population matters

07:20.440 --> 07:25.800
to an extent because the bigger the population, typically the more competitive. Would you agree

07:25.800 --> 07:30.760
with that? Yeah. I mean, certainly there's a correlation. I pay attention to population

07:30.760 --> 07:35.960
insofar as I'm interested in if it's a growth area, right? Where maybe other people are not

07:35.960 --> 07:40.600
looking because I'm able to look there and see like, all right, two years ago, this was the

07:40.600 --> 07:45.080
population. Now it's this population. If it continues at this rate, it's this population.

07:45.080 --> 07:49.800
And if there's people moving there, people building homes or whatever, that's going to

07:49.800 --> 07:55.080
increase search volume over time and I can get in early. But aside from that, search volume is king

07:55.080 --> 08:02.280
for sure. That's a good point. And when I disregard search or population, it's in the sense of like

08:02.280 --> 08:07.800
I've been in other programs where they don't even talk about search volume. It's just like

08:07.800 --> 08:12.760
go into a city with this kind of a population and that's it. I like what Ryan's saying and I'll give

08:12.760 --> 08:16.840
you guys a good example. Bentonville, Arkansas, Bentonville concrete. You guys have heard me

08:16.840 --> 08:22.600
share this example many, many times. Bentonville concrete was a very low population when I started.

08:22.600 --> 08:27.800
The reason I was confident going into that city, guys, is because I had lived in that city for

08:27.800 --> 08:34.440
three summers in a row and I had watched every summer that we came back. There was new

08:34.440 --> 08:40.840
neighborhoods popping up everywhere and I had heard that Walmart had implemented this rule

08:40.840 --> 08:45.320
that said if you want to sell to Walmart, if you are a vendor, if you are somebody that sells

08:45.320 --> 08:51.560
jerky, for example, to Walmart, you have to have somebody from your office living in that city.

08:51.720 --> 08:55.640
I'm like, okay, that means that if people are going to keep selling to Walmart, they have to

08:55.640 --> 09:00.600
have somebody that lives in the city, naturally the city is going to keep growing. That was just like

09:00.600 --> 09:07.720
an intuition gut instinct type of a decision that I made and I knew the area. I think that's really

09:07.720 --> 09:11.400
important and we may end up adding that to the training. Real quick, how do you look at,

09:12.040 --> 09:17.160
do you just go ahead and search population growth over the past five years for the specific city?

09:18.120 --> 09:23.480
Yeah, so I'll use chat GPT and prompt it with a question about population growth and it'll

09:23.480 --> 09:32.280
give me instances of cities that are growing. Then I also do what you do where I live in Tennessee

09:32.280 --> 09:37.080
and I know which areas are growing because I know my area and then I know areas where friends live

09:37.080 --> 09:42.120
and I just listen. I'm always thinking about local lead generation. They're talking about their new

09:43.000 --> 09:49.240
you know move to some area in Tennessee and they're talking about how everyone's moving

09:49.240 --> 09:55.160
there and how it's the new like little darling hotspot. I think probably a good spot for a site

09:55.160 --> 10:00.680
and so I'll go look at that and see like, okay, the numbers are not quite what I want them to be

10:00.680 --> 10:06.920
just on its face but I know this area is growing so I'm going to see what happens and usually turns

10:06.920 --> 10:12.760
out pretty good. I like that. Give us an example. You don't have to give us too much your secret

10:12.760 --> 10:20.120
sauce but when you say a prompt with chat GPT, what do you mean? Do you say, hey, what are some

10:20.120 --> 10:26.200
of the areas, what cities in the US, what cities in the Midwest have a 200% increase in population

10:26.200 --> 10:31.240
over the past five years like something like that? Yeah, you can't really go wrong with your prompt

10:31.240 --> 10:37.240
if you're trying to get it population growth. I start pretty wide. I start just in the United

10:37.240 --> 10:43.560
States and I say give me the suburbs in the United States that have the greatest population

10:43.560 --> 10:48.280
growth over the last, over the previous two years and it'll think for a second and then it'll spit

10:48.280 --> 10:54.840
out you know however many, right? I can tap it and say give me the most recent 20 and that's where

10:54.840 --> 11:00.040
I'll start my due diligence, right? Where I'll look at, okay, these are growing and maybe these

11:00.040 --> 11:04.360
are off the radar of other lean generators. They're not looking at these yet and that can

11:04.360 --> 11:10.360
also filter by population size. So if I think that you know the population is too big and it's growing,

11:10.360 --> 11:15.960
I could say give me populations under you know 100,000 and then I'll take that and plug it into

11:15.960 --> 11:20.280
search volume tools and look at, okay, what is the actual search volume? Because I don't really care

11:20.280 --> 11:26.120
like you said about population being like the metric. I want it to be what is the actual search

11:26.200 --> 11:32.280
volume but I will start with is this an area that is trending because trending growth means

11:32.280 --> 11:36.520
that there's people that are buying things. They have to build. They have to you know refurbish

11:36.520 --> 11:41.160
homes. There's people that are probably going to invest in those markets that are looking to

11:41.160 --> 11:46.840
replace their driveways and their brick and those kinds of things. So genius. I think that's really,

11:46.840 --> 11:52.520
really smart. So anyway that's just something to think about guys. One other little wrinkle

11:52.520 --> 11:56.520
and guys, the answer that we're going to come give you here in just a moment on the search volume

11:56.520 --> 12:02.440
side per what RankinRent Engine says, there are going to be some caveats to it, okay?

12:03.960 --> 12:12.040
So let's, I'm trying to think. I don't think we necessarily need to show this on the RankinRent.

12:12.040 --> 12:18.360
So what I'll do, maybe I'll just discuss what I think is going to be the, I'm trying to think

12:18.360 --> 12:21.880
what would be the best way if I could, do we think we need to show this or we could just kind of

12:21.880 --> 12:25.960
discuss it and then we can get into the tool after? Yeah, let's talk through it and then we

12:25.960 --> 12:36.040
can show it. Okay. So I'm going to pull up some of the metrics that I found. Let's see. Let me go to,

12:38.680 --> 12:46.920
so here's what I did guys. All right there. So as I told you was I was coming up with this

12:47.640 --> 12:51.720
and again, the thing that we're addressing is what, when you're doing your due diligence,

12:53.400 --> 12:59.000
what is the minimum search volume that can give you the, at least in that area that says, hey,

12:59.560 --> 13:03.640
I know at the very least there's going to be enough volume because some of the issues that

13:03.640 --> 13:09.880
people run into is they go into a city, it looks good, it's low competition, it's the right niche,

13:10.680 --> 13:16.520
you know, whatever, and they start running ads and they get a couple leads and then it's like,

13:16.520 --> 13:21.640
it just dies, right? Or I don't know, have you ever had this happen, Ryan? You build a website,

13:21.640 --> 13:27.480
you rank it and you're still only getting like 10 leads and you're like the number one person.

13:27.480 --> 13:31.240
Have you ever had that happen or have you never gone to a city that has that low search? Many

13:31.240 --> 13:35.720
times, many times. And the mistake, the number one mistake that I made when that's happened

13:35.720 --> 13:42.360
is I get impatient and I need it. I did that in, I'll just say, I did that in Selena, Texas,

13:42.360 --> 13:48.600
the suburb of, I think it's the Dallas, Fort Worth area. And it was not getting what I wanted. I

13:48.600 --> 13:54.600
thought it's going to go great. And I just got impatient and I was like, I'm not renewing this

13:54.600 --> 13:58.520
domain. I'm getting rid of this domain. I don't just nuke the site, just get rid of it, right?

13:58.520 --> 14:03.880
I don't want a bunch of riffraff in my site portfolio. The mistake I made is that that city

14:03.880 --> 14:09.400
is still growing, right? It's still like, there's only so much space in the Dallas, Fort Worth area.

14:09.400 --> 14:16.280
And so it's going to eventually be within my parameters, right? And it might go from,

14:17.640 --> 14:24.040
10 leads to 20 leads over the course of the next couple of years per month. And I should have kept

14:24.040 --> 14:28.440
it, right? So I just let those sit because all that's going to happen is that domain is going to

14:28.440 --> 14:32.760
age. It's going to get hit with some more backlinks. It's going to, and it'll be number one forever.

14:33.560 --> 14:41.160
You can't beat that very easily. That's so hyper local that you're glued to the top at that point.

14:41.160 --> 14:47.560
Glued, glued. So that's a good point. And I actually have a situation like that as well.

14:48.680 --> 14:53.800
And just because I don't check it long enough, it was kind of pissing me off. It wasn't getting

14:53.800 --> 15:00.600
enough leads. We got a deal, but it was very low. And then the city just started growing. It's a

15:00.600 --> 15:06.120
city in Utah. And it's kind of like, over the past, this year, I'll give you an example,

15:06.120 --> 15:11.400
looking at the data right now, this is a city of the population of 35,000. And it's averaged,

15:12.040 --> 15:18.120
there isn't concrete. It's averaged 13.1 calls per month. This is through October 30th. And it's

15:18.120 --> 15:26.520
averaged another 3.7 per month with the quote form. So I'm averaging close to 18 leads per month.

15:26.520 --> 15:30.440
And I almost ripped the city. It's not making me a ton of money. It's making me like 600 bucks

15:30.920 --> 15:35.640
a month. But dude, 500, 600 bucks a month, go find that on a real estate deal right now.

15:35.640 --> 15:40.120
You know what I'm saying? Yeah. And where else is that business owner going to get leads?

15:40.920 --> 15:47.720
Exactly. What other option do they have? If you're getting 18 leads a month in that area,

15:47.720 --> 15:51.240
and you're number one, and you're running ads, and you're doing everything right,

15:51.240 --> 15:55.640
what other options do they have at that point? You're locked in with that business owner.

15:55.640 --> 16:00.440
100%. 100%. So here's the projects I looked at. I want to give you guys kind of a range.

16:00.440 --> 16:08.120
I looked at, let me see. We got one, two, three, four. I looked at five different projects.

16:09.000 --> 16:16.760
And when I did the training before version one and version two, I basically just took one project

16:16.760 --> 16:21.480
because it was ranking really well. That was Bentonville Concrete. And I said, okay,

16:21.480 --> 16:24.840
I know how many leads this is getting. It's ranking in the GMB. It's ranking in the maps.

16:24.840 --> 16:29.800
And I want to compare that with what the tool says. Well, one thing that happened that I didn't

16:29.800 --> 16:34.600
even think about is as we start to talk about Bentonville Concrete, the people in the group,

16:35.160 --> 16:40.360
and maybe even in the free group, are searching Bentonville Concrete. So I think, I personally

16:40.360 --> 16:45.480
think it had an effect and kind of skewed the numbers a little bit on that city. It drove the

16:45.480 --> 16:50.680
cost up significantly on the cost per click and everything else. So I ended up looking at five

16:50.680 --> 16:58.120
different projects. Of those, one, two, three of those are in concrete. One of them is in towing

16:58.120 --> 17:01.480
and one of them is in duct cleaning. I kind of wanted to get a little bit of a mix.

17:02.680 --> 17:09.240
We had a ranging population. One of them was a 35,000 population. All the way up to the highest

17:09.240 --> 17:16.520
was a 95,000 population. So nothing that's too big, okay? But here's what I came up with. And

17:16.520 --> 17:22.760
this is what Ryan and I, after discussing with his research, my research, is that we don't have

17:23.480 --> 17:31.640
an exact, exact, exact, but we have a range. And what we mean by that is if you go into a city

17:32.280 --> 17:41.480
that is very low-hanging fruit, very non-competitive, low CPC, not much competition,

17:41.480 --> 17:45.320
that you can just tell the people that are in the, that are ranking for those keywords,

17:45.720 --> 17:48.760
brand new websites, or they're not very old, they don't have much content, they don't have

17:48.760 --> 17:53.160
much backlinks. It looks like just a bunch of hillbilly freaking people ranking against you.

17:53.960 --> 18:02.120
In those situations, we can safely say 50 on it, again, using the rank and rent engine search tool,

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
due diligence tool. If it says 50, you're in good hands. That's on a low competition

18:09.880 --> 18:15.560
area. If it's on a medium competition area where, okay, a couple of your competitors on,

18:15.560 --> 18:18.840
you know, for your main keywords, they have a pretty good website. Maybe you're going up

18:18.840 --> 18:22.360
against a rank and rent person that's a medium competition. You could still rank,

18:22.360 --> 18:26.040
but it's going to be a bit more difficult. Maybe the CPC is tipping closer to five,

18:26.040 --> 18:31.560
maybe even slightly over. You want to make sure you're at least 70, okay? And again,

18:31.560 --> 18:38.280
this is on your main keyword, your main keyword. What was the other thing? Oh,

18:38.280 --> 18:43.240
then the last thing I was going to say, and on those cities that are high competition,

18:44.120 --> 18:47.480
you shouldn't be going into anyway, you freaking dummies. No, I'm just kidding.

18:47.480 --> 18:51.240
But if it's high competition, you shouldn't be going into it. So if it's medium competition,

18:51.240 --> 18:57.080
make sure it's 70. If it's low competition, 50 you can get away with. And that's good. I

18:57.080 --> 19:02.600
feel pretty dang confident about saying that. Now, keep in mind, if you're running ads,

19:03.160 --> 19:07.080
the ads during the winter, during certain times of the year, it's going to be up and down a bit.

19:07.080 --> 19:11.640
But we know that if we can get the ads going, if we can get ranked organically,

19:11.640 --> 19:17.160
and you know, in some cases, maybe grab a GMB if you get lucky, then you're going to be in

19:17.160 --> 19:21.480
great shape. So anything you want to add to that, Ryan, I know that's like a bit anticlimactic. Maybe

19:21.480 --> 19:26.200
you guys expect it to be something different, but again, this is not with any tool because we're not

19:26.840 --> 19:33.160
before it was use any tool. We're specifically talking about rank and rent engine with this.

19:33.160 --> 19:36.120
And that's why we wanted to wait to come out with this. So go ahead, Ryan.

19:36.120 --> 19:40.520
Totally. I think Nick nailed it. I agree with this. This is my assessment as well.

19:40.520 --> 19:46.600
These things change over time. This is why Nick's group, Digital Landlords, you know, why you're

19:46.600 --> 19:52.360
staying on the cutting edge of the trade craft of this industry is really important because these

19:52.360 --> 19:56.360
are not, it's not static. These are things to revisit and these things to look at. But there

19:56.360 --> 20:00.760
are some things that are like timeless principles. One of them being that search volume is going to be

20:00.760 --> 20:05.640
the largest like driver for success for what a market looks like. And so really paying attention

20:05.640 --> 20:10.280
to what's succeeding and what isn't matters a lot. Those numbers are, I totally agree with those

20:10.280 --> 20:16.120
numbers. The only little thing that I would add to that is that, and I think I saw a question kind

20:16.120 --> 20:23.480
of getting to this in the chat, that the search volume for the primary keyword should include

20:23.480 --> 20:31.080
variants of that keyword. So for example, concrete contractor, contractor near me, right? Those are

20:31.080 --> 20:37.240
going to, if you have like 40 for one and 20 for the other, that's showing 60 between the two of

20:37.240 --> 20:42.840
those. That's like, that's your primary keyword and a variant of it. That's going to get you the

20:42.840 --> 20:49.160
results that you're looking for. Okay. I have a question for you. I'm curious your thoughts.

20:50.520 --> 20:54.600
Let's say I go into rank and run engine. I'm doing concrete. I have concrete contractor,

20:54.600 --> 20:59.000
concrete, concrete sidewalk, concrete driveway, concrete company, all the main keywords of our

20:59.000 --> 21:09.720
keyword list. My main keyword has 50 and all my other keywords show zero. What are you going into

21:09.720 --> 21:19.560
this? Low competition. If it's low competition, I'd try it and see what happens. It's generally

21:19.560 --> 21:33.560
not a good sign if the core keyword list has zero as search volume, because I found that those are

21:33.560 --> 21:43.720
likely often true. However, the caveat that I give on this is that if it shows zero for those and you

21:43.720 --> 21:50.920
go into it and try it, there are examples I found where it has turned out awesome. So it's worth

21:50.920 --> 21:55.800
trying is what I would say, especially with you guys that do the pre-selling method. It's worth

21:55.800 --> 21:59.720
trying because what do you have to lose, right? A little bit of ad spend to know if it works or

21:59.720 --> 22:04.760
it doesn't, and it's a place that others will overlook, right? Because they're saying like,

22:04.760 --> 22:11.640
oh, this is too low, whatever. But these tools, even the very best like rank and run engine pulls

22:11.640 --> 22:18.280
directly in from Google. Google Keyword Planner is the best, right? That is Google saying, here's what

22:19.160 --> 22:27.000
we're seeing in our search ecosystem. And that is the standard, right? And so we're pulling in API

22:27.000 --> 22:32.520
data from them. And so if Google is saying that, sometimes they don't always know perfectly. And

22:32.520 --> 22:38.120
if Google doesn't know, these other tools sure don't know. So you might be able to find one where

22:38.120 --> 22:42.040
you're going to be able to win and you're not going to have anyone that's going to come in and try to

22:43.320 --> 22:48.920
catch you before you can close the business owner. So I've had that happen before as well. So it

22:48.920 --> 22:56.120
doesn't deter me. That's another thing that I like. When I was using SEMrush before, it seemed

22:57.080 --> 23:05.240
for whatever reason I would type in, let's say Bentonville concrete, it would show nothing. And

23:05.240 --> 23:12.680
then I type in concrete Bentonville AR, and it would show 50. And it was so confusing. But the

23:12.680 --> 23:17.080
way that I kind of went after it, I was always like, I was guessing a bit, but I was like, well,

23:17.080 --> 23:22.760
if I see at least two keywords, two variations, and I have all these different variations I would

23:22.760 --> 23:29.400
try, okay, then I'm good. Like with St. George, for example, St. George, people spell it S-T

23:29.400 --> 23:35.000
George. Some people spell it S-A-I-N-T George. So I'd have to try all these variations. So anyway,

23:35.000 --> 23:40.120
it's just nice because I'm able to just go and look at all the keywords at once if I'm like,

23:40.120 --> 23:43.400
okay, I want to try just a slight difference. Yeah, I can go change it all at once and run them

23:43.400 --> 23:49.000
instantly. But I definitely agree, guys. That's the beautiful thing about doing the pre-song.

23:49.080 --> 23:54.520
I was just going to say, Ryan, if I were to ask you, hey, with that same scenario, 50 search volume,

23:54.520 --> 24:01.400
zero on the other keywords, would you go and build a website there by the domain, do the whole thing?

24:01.400 --> 24:05.240
I bet you your answer would be no, because you're not 100% confident. But I'd be willing to try it

24:05.240 --> 24:10.760
for 100 bucks, right? Throw 100 bucks ads out. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't think there's a wrong

24:10.760 --> 24:17.480
answer there. Some people will put up sites just to put up a site and see what happens and then

24:17.480 --> 24:21.800
let it sit. And then the worst case scenario is, is two years later, you've got a domain age

24:21.800 --> 24:25.480
of two years that no one can touch you on if they try to come in there, at least on that,

24:26.040 --> 24:32.200
on your domain age. But it makes way more sense if you're optimizing for speed and just trying

24:32.200 --> 24:36.440
to see which one is going to land to, hey, throw something up there, run some ads to it. If it

24:36.440 --> 24:45.320
doesn't work, move on. 100%. And I would argue, guys, if you are going into a niche like a concrete

24:45.320 --> 24:51.560
and you find a city that's really low-hanging fruit and it's questionable, you know that this

24:51.560 --> 24:55.320
example I'm giving you guys with the 35,000 population, it's slowly started to grow.

24:55.880 --> 25:02.600
You know people need concrete. So even if you build it and there's not a ton of leads,

25:02.600 --> 25:09.880
there's always a deal to be had. But because I believe in pre-selling, because I only sell

25:10.840 --> 25:15.880
using the pre-selling method, I know that some of you guys have been frustrated in the past

25:15.880 --> 25:21.080
because you go in, it looks good. It's low-hanging fruit. It's kind of on that teetering edge

25:21.080 --> 25:25.400
of volume. You do the ads and then all of a sudden you start like, it goes like a week and

25:25.400 --> 25:30.280
you don't see anything. So if you want to be very, very, very, very conservative,

25:31.400 --> 25:38.520
I would say 70 and above, as long as it's medium competition or less, you're good to go. But again,

25:38.520 --> 25:43.240
if it's low competition, I think you could go as low as 50 and be pretty safe. But again,

25:43.240 --> 25:47.560
there's variables. It's hard to just give a black and white. If there's no volume for the

25:47.560 --> 25:55.000
ancillary keywords, that could be a red flag. If there's just all kinds of different little

25:55.000 --> 25:59.640
tiny factors that you need to consider. So a couple of questions I want to address really quick.

26:01.560 --> 26:07.240
Gina says, I know a city near us in Georgia, but there is not a great search volume.

26:07.880 --> 26:12.360
Do you still go into it? I think she's referring to probably a city that's growing.

26:14.840 --> 26:18.840
She said there's not great search volume. I think in that case, just like what you just said,

26:18.840 --> 26:24.520
you can kind of get an age domain going, kind of make a long-term play, but you're probably not

26:24.520 --> 26:28.920
going to see a lot right out the gates, even if you run ads, if there's not much search volume.

26:28.920 --> 26:35.880
What are your thoughts? Yeah. It depends on your perception of that city, I think. So I've got a

26:35.880 --> 26:42.280
city in Tennessee that is really small on the search volume numbers, do not look good. But I

26:42.280 --> 26:47.080
know that that city is growing. I know that there are people moving there, that people want to live

26:47.080 --> 26:54.840
there, that it's got a upward trajectory that is unmatched by any other city really in Tennessee

26:54.840 --> 27:02.040
right now. So I put one there and that site kills it. It's doing great. So Gina, I'd say like, look,

27:02.680 --> 27:06.360
it depends on the way that you build your agency and your own personal approach to

27:07.240 --> 27:10.840
your risk assessment, right? Are you willing to see what happens if you put a hundred bucks

27:10.840 --> 27:14.760
of ads into it? Because it could mean that you find something that no one else is looking at

27:14.760 --> 27:19.800
and no one else is going to find. And if you do, that's a win, right? In my agency, I tend to go

27:19.800 --> 27:25.080
for those things. I tend to just say, hey, let's try it out. Let's see what happens and experiment.

27:25.480 --> 27:34.200
A lot of this business model I've found is try it, right? Just see what happens. And if it works,

27:34.200 --> 27:38.280
you've got a winner. And if it doesn't work, at least now you know, and you're not going to

27:38.280 --> 27:44.360
just always be wondering about it. Right. I think that's solid advice. Richard says,

27:45.400 --> 27:49.080
for the main keyword question mark, what about the long tail keyword? I think we addressed that,

27:49.080 --> 27:52.600
right? Maybe he said that before we got into it, but we kind of addressed that, correct?

27:53.400 --> 27:59.960
Yeah. Yeah. I think it's helpful to understand why would someone search for a long tail keyword?

27:59.960 --> 28:07.640
In your own search habits, why would a person search habits? Why would they search for a

28:07.640 --> 28:14.120
long tail keyword? And think about if I'm living in Memphis and I want a concrete contractor,

28:14.120 --> 28:20.200
I'm just going to search concrete contractor, right? Because I don't need to search. Google

28:20.200 --> 28:25.000
knows where I live. It's going to pull up local search. If someone searches the long tail keyword,

28:25.000 --> 28:31.400
concrete contractor in Memphis, Tennessee, they probably do not live in the Memphis area. So

28:31.400 --> 28:38.360
they're looking from outside. Who looks from outside of a city? General contractors, builders,

28:38.360 --> 28:45.560
investors, people that are looking to do projects in the city, commercial, people looking for

28:45.560 --> 28:52.440
commercial work that manage a commercial facility in the city. So I found that if the

28:52.440 --> 28:58.520
long tail keyword has search volume, it probably is a high growth area because it means that people

28:58.520 --> 29:03.400
from outside the city who have money, who want to invest in properties in that city by doing some

29:03.400 --> 29:09.080
kind of project related to that keyword are searching for it, right? That's kind of the

29:09.080 --> 29:15.160
psychology behind long tail keywords that I found has been indicative of a growth area.

29:18.440 --> 29:23.240
Okay, let's keep moving along. And guys, if you have any questions related to the search volume

29:23.240 --> 29:30.280
topic before we get into more of the software side. By the way, I didn't even mention this

29:30.280 --> 29:36.840
at the beginning, which is bad, but we're going to be, again, I said this at the beginning,

29:36.840 --> 29:41.480
we appreciate everyone that did the beta stuff. We're like one month, our original deal, we gave

29:41.480 --> 29:48.360
everybody two months of free beta, right? Was that what it was? Or two months of 20% off.

29:49.640 --> 29:53.480
And anyway, we just appreciate that feedback. And I know we've implemented, you've implemented

29:53.480 --> 29:57.400
quite a few of the changes already, haven't you, Ryan? Yeah. Yeah. So thanks to everyone that did

29:57.400 --> 30:02.760
beta. Some of these are here. So Richard particularly has been super helpful. He submitted

30:02.760 --> 30:09.000
a bunch of tickets. You guys, this is made by the people that do this business model. This isn't

30:09.000 --> 30:16.040
made by some corporation that's sitting in Silicon Valley. This is made by people that are doing

30:16.040 --> 30:20.840
rank and rent, people that are industry leaders in this area that have built agencies that are

30:20.840 --> 30:27.240
successful, what works, what doesn't. That's how this tool was created. So we're continuing that

30:28.200 --> 30:33.240
approach in the way that we build rank and rent engine, right? If you're a user and you're like,

30:33.240 --> 30:37.720
hey, be cool if it did this, be cool if it did this. We have a feature request that you could

30:37.720 --> 30:41.480
put in and that goes straight to my inbox. And I look at those and I'm like, you know what?

30:42.200 --> 30:47.720
That'd be great. Let's do that. And then I just task out the developers and they go and they create

30:47.720 --> 30:52.520
it, right? We add it to the product roadmap. So over the course of beta, we found edge cases

30:52.520 --> 30:57.880
and things like that that were important for you guys to have it in the platform.

30:57.880 --> 31:01.160
And we made those updates. And so it's been really, really useful. And part of the,

31:02.200 --> 31:05.560
there was a discount for the first two months for people that were the early signups for beta.

31:05.560 --> 31:12.360
And we really appreciate you guys. Yeah. Quick question, just a clarification, Ryan.

31:13.240 --> 31:20.120
The people that did do beta, if they want to, are they able to tap into an extended

31:20.680 --> 31:25.320
discount based on what we set up or do we have to, or is it just, is it done?

31:26.040 --> 31:30.440
Yeah. If they've already made an account and they took advantage of the beta pricing,

31:30.440 --> 31:34.040
that was for early access for the folks in the beta. And so they've got that.

31:35.640 --> 31:41.320
We'll have deals and things like that in the future. They'll get access to things that come

31:41.320 --> 31:47.400
out later on just as a gesture of saying, thank you. But they got locked into that early pricing

31:47.640 --> 31:55.720
from the job. Also for you guys that are in this, we're going to make sure that we take care of you

31:55.720 --> 32:01.160
guys above everybody. So just keep that in mind. And again, we just want to say we appreciate the

32:01.160 --> 32:10.280
feedback. Okay. Bo says, okay, this one I'm going to read the question. You can give your feedback.

32:10.280 --> 32:14.120
I'm going to give my feedback and I'm going to tell you what my answer is. But he says,

32:15.080 --> 32:20.120
can you touch on CPC on Rare? Before I read the whole question, I'm going to let you know this,

32:20.120 --> 32:29.480
Bo, is that I have a pretty solid answer because of course we're looking at this. There's another

32:29.480 --> 32:35.400
question that's related to the backlinks. There's a couple different components of due diligence.

32:35.400 --> 32:42.040
We're just making sure that we're dialed in. On the CPC, I'm at the same place I was a few weeks

32:42.120 --> 32:51.080
ago with the search volume, which is I'm in, this campaign's performing well. How does it look

32:51.080 --> 32:56.280
inside of RankinRen Engine? Okay. Now I can confidently say this is what it should be. So

32:57.080 --> 33:05.160
I don't have a solid answer. Do this every time. Is it the average of this for you just yet? But I

33:05.160 --> 33:10.920
just will answer by saying that's what I'm working on now. Now that we have the search volume piece,

33:10.920 --> 33:17.160
now we're working on what the CPC should be according to Rare, as well as the backlinks

33:17.160 --> 33:20.200
as well. So I don't know, Ryan, do you have anything else you want to add on that?

33:22.200 --> 33:29.800
Yeah. I'd say that you're trying to get on the high top of page to get the most leads,

33:30.920 --> 33:36.840
but it's not the end of the world if you don't. This goes back into like, this is a little bit

33:36.840 --> 33:40.520
squishy, right? You're going to have to try it out. You're going to have to see what works for you.

33:40.520 --> 33:45.800
And then see what kind of results that you're actually getting. So if I see a high top of page

33:45.800 --> 33:51.400
bid that is like 20 bucks, I'm not going to even fool with it, right? But if I see one that's $10

33:51.400 --> 33:57.320
and then the low top of page bid is $1 and it's averaging at five, I'm totally comfortable with

33:57.320 --> 34:04.600
that, right? Because what I'll do is also run ads that are a little bit off hours as well. So starting

34:04.600 --> 34:11.800
at 7.30 in the morning through, I don't know, 7 p.m. at night where others are not running ads,

34:11.800 --> 34:16.440
I'm going to take advantage of that high top of page bid when others are not running ads. Maybe

34:16.440 --> 34:21.720
there's end at 5 p.m. and mine runs until 7 p.m. I'm going to get cheaper ad clicks in that two

34:21.720 --> 34:27.560
hour delta between those times. So there's strategies and tactics that you can deploy to

34:27.560 --> 34:33.000
take advantage of the less expensive clicks. But I don't worry about the high top of page bid if I

34:33.000 --> 34:39.720
think that on an average across my keywords that I'm going to do okay for my campaign forecasting.

34:41.960 --> 34:48.600
Beautiful. So yeah, Bo, stay tuned. We'll have more details on that. I would rather let you know,

34:48.600 --> 34:54.040
say that to you than give you some random answer. I have to come back and correct. So anyway,

34:54.760 --> 35:03.240
so guys, that's search volume, okay? 50 on the low end, low competition, 50, medium competition,

35:03.240 --> 35:07.800
70. If you want to be extra safe, do 70 and above. To be honest, if it's your first project,

35:08.520 --> 35:16.200
maybe make sure it's 70 and above. But at the end of the day, guys, make sure that we're following

35:16.200 --> 35:19.800
the exact recipe, right? I've given you the recipe of how to bake the perfect cake.

35:20.760 --> 35:25.000
Can you deviate from it and still have success? Yeah, some of you guys have probably done that on

35:25.000 --> 35:30.840
accident and still have success. And then you get in your head, oh my gosh, this is untrue, but

35:32.200 --> 35:36.600
that's an anomaly. And we've done this a lot of times. I've lost a lot of money. I've made the

35:36.600 --> 35:41.480
mistakes. So the closer you can get to the advice that we're giving you, it's because we've tried

35:41.480 --> 35:46.440
it, we've tested it, and that is what we've seen to work. Can it still work if you deviate slightly?

35:46.520 --> 35:51.960
Yes. But every time you deviate, you're running the risk of messing up that recipe that actually

35:51.960 --> 35:59.000
works. All right. That is, I think, all the questions that we had so far on search volume.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.760
We've nailed that. I know you guys have been waiting on that. If anyone has any clarifications,

36:02.760 --> 36:09.560
keep going. Other than that, Ryan, why don't we open back the tool? I know last time,

36:09.560 --> 36:12.920
I'm going to give you co-host, I know last time we literally only got to talk about

36:13.880 --> 36:20.040
due diligence. We got to talk about the Explorer website, kind of do the metrics on that.

36:20.680 --> 36:26.200
We didn't get a ton into the project stuff, the list of projects, the CRM, that kind of stuff. So

36:26.200 --> 36:36.360
let me give you co-host real quick, sir. Let me see why this doesn't work. Hold on.

36:36.360 --> 36:44.200
All right. Beautiful. Okay, done.

36:45.560 --> 36:49.800
Cool. Fire it up. Where do you want to go with it? Where do you want to take this train today?

36:51.320 --> 36:58.520
I just want you to give them a bit more. Last time when we talked, I always get hung up talking

36:58.520 --> 37:03.720
and talking and talking about the due diligence, because to me, that's the easiest way that I could

37:03.800 --> 37:08.600
just see how valuable this is, because that's how much time it took me to do due diligence

37:08.600 --> 37:13.560
when I was coming up and doing them literally on sheets of paper. But there's so much more

37:13.560 --> 37:20.840
that this does. I think more of the project management, show them more on what they can

37:20.840 --> 37:25.160
do with the CRM, just some of that stuff, especially for the people that maybe weren't

37:25.160 --> 37:29.160
on the call last time. I don't think we had a ton of people on the last time we did it. We

37:29.160 --> 37:36.920
didn't promote it super hard because we were just doing a beta anyway. I think we could also talk

37:36.920 --> 37:40.600
about the Keyword Planner, but let's just get into this. Guys, for those that have no idea what

37:40.600 --> 37:43.560
that we're talking about, this is Rank and Run Engine. This is something that Ryan's been working

37:43.560 --> 37:52.040
on for 15 months. It's the version 2.0 of what he's used to scale his agency. It's our go-to

37:52.040 --> 37:57.320
standard tool that we are going to be using exclusively because it's getting data directly

37:57.320 --> 38:02.440
from Google and because we can control it and we can give Ryan feedback and a host of different

38:02.440 --> 38:08.840
reasons. It's super affordable. It's less than the price of a tool of it, like SEMrush, et cetera.

38:08.840 --> 38:12.360
But that is what this is, and we're just going to be talking about that a bit today. For those of

38:12.360 --> 38:24.760
you that did not get the beta code, you can message me and I have a code that you guys can use as a

38:24.760 --> 38:30.520
launch code that you guys can access as well. If you were not part of the beta and you're

38:30.520 --> 38:34.760
interested, message me. I'll send you a code. We can go from there. Ryan, let's go into some

38:34.760 --> 38:38.040
of these different features, some of these different benefits that this tool has.

38:38.760 --> 38:45.480
For sure. Let's talk about Bo's question. Bo asked about the difference between the low

38:45.480 --> 38:51.800
top of page bid and the high top of page bid. This is Keyword Planner. We're going to do the

38:51.800 --> 38:59.400
keyword masonry and we're doing it in Knoxville. You guys that are building your agencies need to,

39:00.360 --> 39:04.760
one of the most important things you can understand about this keyword tool is some of them are going

39:04.760 --> 39:09.880
to have local cities that are smaller. Some of them have DMA regions, which are much larger.

39:09.880 --> 39:15.960
You can go into bigger markets sometimes if you know that your search volume is good and your cost

39:15.960 --> 39:22.520
per click is really low. This is an example. Brick related things in the Knoxville area.

39:23.160 --> 39:26.520
I'm not saying that this meets the population requirements. I'm not saying that it's low

39:26.520 --> 39:30.920
hanging fruit. I'm just using this as an example to answer Bo's question. I had this pulled up.

39:31.560 --> 39:35.400
He was asking about the difference with low top of page bid and high top of page bid.

39:36.200 --> 39:44.200
Google's saying, hey, it's $1.43 per click for the low and $3.92 for the high. That's awesome.

39:44.200 --> 39:48.200
That's a great keyword. Some of these, though, guys are more expensive. I'm going to do masonry

39:48.200 --> 39:53.720
and masonry contractor near me. You can see that the difference between four bucks and $33 almost

39:53.720 --> 40:02.600
is pretty significant. There's other keywords in here that are going to be gold mines. Let me just

40:02.600 --> 40:10.600
do bricks, veneers. This goes to Gene's question a little bit about building a good keyword list.

40:10.600 --> 40:20.040
Look at this. 140 search volume and less than $2. Just because an industry has those really,

40:20.040 --> 40:26.120
really high dollar amounts doesn't mean that it's not viable. You can find these keywords

40:26.120 --> 40:31.560
that people look for brick veneers. That's a really high ticket service. You get to re-brick

40:31.560 --> 40:35.720
a whole house with brick veneers and it's going to be really expensive. You can get that click

40:35.720 --> 40:42.840
for less than two bucks. Until you and I talk, I didn't even know what that was.

40:42.840 --> 40:49.560
If somebody's searching brick veneers, they are buying the service. They are in buy mode. That

40:49.560 --> 40:53.720
means you've gone down the rabbit hole a little bit in your research. Am I correct in that?

40:54.360 --> 41:01.560
Yeah, man. Yeah. They're looking for ... Brick veneers is a specialty brick service that

41:02.360 --> 41:06.360
it's not a DIY thing, man. You're not doing DIY brick veneers usually unless you're

41:07.400 --> 41:11.320
Bob Villa, right? It's just not happening. Another is tuck pointing.

41:12.680 --> 41:16.920
Hold on. Is brick veneering just like doing veneers on your teeth? Do they whittle your

41:16.920 --> 41:19.560
teeth down so you look like a gremlin and then they put the caps on?

41:20.120 --> 41:23.800
Yeah. Yeah. They do that to your house. That's crazy, dude.

41:24.600 --> 41:29.960
They put brick veneers on the outside of the house to give that timeless brick look. It's

41:29.960 --> 41:34.200
really popular. You can see just on the search volume here how popular this is.

41:34.200 --> 41:38.920
That's another money keyword that ... There's these variations here, right? Brick paneling.

41:39.560 --> 41:43.080
People that search this don't know to call it brick veneers, but they know what it is.

41:44.360 --> 41:50.120
Thin brick, brick veneers. You can see that even though if you do masonry contractor and you're

41:50.120 --> 41:54.840
mean, it's 30 bucks a click. The people that are looking for brick veneers are looking brick

41:54.840 --> 42:00.360
paneling and these other brick-related overlay type keywords. They're looking for a masonry

42:00.360 --> 42:06.680
contractor. You don't have to get totally hung up on, oh, it's $30. This isn't going to work.

42:07.800 --> 42:10.600
This is just another way to search for that primary keyword.

42:10.600 --> 42:14.840
I have a question, Ryan. Let's say that we were looking that up. Let's say we're in masonry.

42:14.840 --> 42:22.200
We find out masonry is 30 bucks a click top, the high end. You're like, okay, I could go and target

42:22.920 --> 42:29.080
terms like this on my ads. On your SEO side, would you still be targeting the term masonry

42:29.080 --> 42:35.960
as your H1 on your page title, that kind of thing, or would you change that strategy at all?

42:36.680 --> 42:42.760
100%. This is still going to be masonry near me. They're looking for a brick masonry contractor.

42:42.760 --> 42:48.760
That's the expensive one. It's $18. It's a cost per click average. This is still what I'm targeting.

42:48.760 --> 42:53.240
This is still my primary keyword. It's still going to my H1. It's still going to my landing page,

42:54.200 --> 42:59.000
but if I run ads to it, it is probably not going to make the mix.

42:59.720 --> 43:05.320
The reason I wanted to bring that up, guys, is that the thing that's interesting is when you see

43:05.320 --> 43:11.720
high CPC, it's terrible for ads, but nothing's better than when you have organic

43:12.520 --> 43:16.840
leads coming in for those high CPC terms. That usually means that they're very highly sought

43:16.840 --> 43:24.120
after. The good strategy is get your clicks for the low cost terms, start ranking for the high

43:24.120 --> 43:29.960
cost terms, and between the two, you have a freaking smasher of a website. It also looks

43:29.960 --> 43:34.200
like the freaking hooptie of websites, the Geo Metro of websites while you're at it.

43:35.800 --> 43:40.120
Yeah, absolutely. That's a great strategy. You're able to take advantage of these other

43:40.920 --> 43:45.960
keywords that are overlooked. Let's see. Did I misspell that? Tuck, oink, ding.

43:46.040 --> 43:51.080
Okay. Spelling is hard when I'm doing it live. All right. This one is another good example of

43:51.080 --> 43:55.560
a keyword that between tuck pointing and tuck pointing near me and some of these others,

43:55.560 --> 44:00.360
there might be 40 or 50 searches a month, but it's going to be super cheap clicks.

44:01.960 --> 44:08.200
That's not a DIY thing. Someone's paying a mason to come out and do that. Be mindful of,

44:08.200 --> 44:12.680
just because you see that high top of page bid doesn't mean that it's not a viable market.

44:12.680 --> 44:17.000
Look for some of these keywords that they're looking for a specialist to do. They're just

44:17.000 --> 44:24.120
not using the specialist primary keyword that has that high cost per click.

44:26.120 --> 44:29.800
Gina had a really interesting suggestion. I don't know if you want to wrap up this thought,

44:29.800 --> 44:33.000
or if you're done, but maybe you could show ... You don't have to show a full,

44:33.000 --> 44:37.240
but maybe we could pick a niche and you could show us how you go about building a keyword list

44:38.200 --> 44:43.960
using rank and run engine, coming up with ideas, seeing what's highly searched,

44:43.960 --> 44:46.680
that kind of thing. I don't know if that's something you could show us.

44:46.680 --> 44:50.440
Yeah, dude. Let's do it live. What do you got? Give me a niche. What do you want to do?

44:50.440 --> 44:58.520
Let's stay away from the regulars, but let's keep it still. Let's ask Gina. Gina, what do you got?

44:58.520 --> 45:05.400
Give us something that's not concrete, tree service, spray foam insulation, and we'll do it.

45:05.400 --> 45:12.920
If it is one of those, then let's keep going. I love those niches. I still make money in those

45:12.920 --> 45:18.520
niches. We're still closing deals in those niches, but I guess I'm just a little tired of talking

45:18.520 --> 45:24.760
about concrete, personally. It's only because I've been doing it for three years. I'm still

45:24.760 --> 45:29.720
going to do it. I just am tired of talking about it. I love some demo.

45:30.520 --> 45:36.280
Yeah, exactly. If you're watching this car right now, demo, I've got some demo clients and they do

45:36.280 --> 45:42.680
not bat an eye at $1,500 a month. They don't think twice about it because the demo jobs,

45:43.880 --> 45:48.200
entry-level demo jobs are high ticket, but they'll get jobs that are like,

45:49.320 --> 45:53.640
I had a demo job come in for one of my clients that was a quarter million dollars.

45:54.200 --> 45:57.880
Crazy. Yeah. Let's do some demo. Let's do demo.

45:57.960 --> 46:01.080
Just to answer Gina's question really quick, she says, are we not using the Google Trends?

46:01.080 --> 46:08.520
No, guys. We want to see how Ryan's using this to build his keyword list. Remember, we're redoing

46:08.520 --> 46:15.400
the training 3.0. In the meantime, you can still follow everything the exact same. The training is

46:15.400 --> 46:20.680
still how I build my keyword list. You got to remember, this tool just came out three,

46:20.680 --> 46:27.960
four weeks ago. I'm still taking my strategy using how I used to and then how am I going to

46:27.960 --> 46:32.680
use it here, looking at what Ryan's doing. But no, for anybody that's confused, just keep following

46:32.680 --> 46:37.320
the training. It still works as how I've continually made thousands and thousands of dollars, but we

46:37.320 --> 46:44.920
want to see how Ryan's using Rare because we want to utilize and just beat the heck out of this tool

46:44.920 --> 46:49.320
as much as possible if we're going to have it. Let's do demolition and let's build a keyword

46:49.320 --> 46:54.280
list. But anyone else that's confused, keep doing what you're doing. This is just to see how Ryan's

46:54.280 --> 46:59.560
doing. This could also be a good way to generate additional ideas if you're hung up trying to find

46:59.560 --> 47:05.400
and build that keyword list. Let's see how you do it, man. Yeah, 100%. Guys, we're showing you a

47:08.680 --> 47:15.880
part of the keyword analysis process, Nick, and the training starts with Google Trends.

47:15.880 --> 47:20.200
You can look at the national, are we in the right ballpark for the cities we're looking at?

47:22.120 --> 47:27.000
That's very similar to talking about the chat GPT approach, looking nationally at what our

47:27.000 --> 47:31.880
search volume is. We're a little bit further along in that part, and we've got some areas

47:31.880 --> 47:38.680
that we're looking at now. This is not removing that part of the training. That's still essential,

47:38.680 --> 47:43.720
but we're just zoomed in a little bit here. Let's say that we see demolition is trending

47:43.720 --> 47:49.400
in Tennessee, and demolition is interesting, guys, because there's only so much real estate

47:49.400 --> 47:55.720
in a city, and there's only so much good real estate in a city. If there's old properties that

47:55.720 --> 48:02.360
are in a blight district or there's an area that is growing, but there's old properties there that

48:02.360 --> 48:08.600
people are buying up, they have to demolish those old properties to build new ones. It's required.

48:09.240 --> 48:15.240
There's only got so much space. Demolition is a really, really good one to go into. I'm a big fan

48:15.240 --> 48:19.880
of demolition. Demolition, let's do Tennessee. Let's just see what happens with some Knoxville.

48:21.960 --> 48:24.520
Just already in here, so let's just search it and see what happens.

48:27.880 --> 48:32.520
You guys can see 260 searches, probably three bucks a click.

48:33.480 --> 48:45.480
3F357 for demolition. Let's see what happens. That's more expensive. Demolition companies near me,

48:45.480 --> 48:54.600
though, is a good one. That's six bucks. What I'll do is I'll go through demolition-related

48:54.600 --> 48:59.880
keywords, demolition, demolition contractor, demolition company, demolition services,

48:59.880 --> 49:08.360
and I'll start looking at what these look like. As I build up my keyword list, I'm going to have

49:08.360 --> 49:12.360
my core, my primary keyword is going to be demolition or demolition contractor,

49:13.560 --> 49:18.440
and then I'm going to start adding these in as part of my core keyword list. It's also going

49:18.440 --> 49:23.400
to depend on what my vision is for this actual site. Do I want other services related demolition,

49:23.400 --> 49:30.600
because demolition guys will often also do excavation and trenching. It just depends on

49:30.600 --> 49:35.320
how you want to eventually build out the site. If you're wanting to just specialize in just straight

49:35.320 --> 49:41.240
up demolition, there's a lot of good keywords here that when you add all these up, there's

49:41.240 --> 49:47.160
probably another 100 or plus or more searches per month in this market just for demolition.

49:47.880 --> 49:54.200
Let's do another city. Let's do some nationals growing. These are bigger areas, but you can see

49:54.200 --> 49:59.480
that there's a lot of opportunity in these areas. Six bucks a click, six bucks a click,

50:00.360 --> 50:10.120
demolition companies near me. I will go and I'll build up my keyword list by looking at the primary

50:10.120 --> 50:15.160
keyword, making sure that it's got solid search volume standards that Nick and I talked about a

50:15.160 --> 50:22.280
second ago. Then I'll add in all these additional ones as part of my secondary keyword list where

50:22.280 --> 50:26.920
these are not primary, but they're variants of the primary. When you add all these up,

50:26.920 --> 50:31.640
you're going to get calls where other people are not optimizing for these keywords, and you're

50:31.640 --> 50:36.120
going to get the call for house demolition companies near me or pool removal contractors,

50:36.680 --> 50:42.920
because the guys that do demolition will also do some of these specialty services

50:42.920 --> 50:47.080
related to demolition. You can add these in commercial demolition contractors. That is a

50:47.080 --> 50:54.840
great keyword, and people are probably not looking for it. Build these out right into a sheet,

50:55.560 --> 51:00.040
and just add these in, or I'll go straight to my due diligence tab and I'll make a due diligence

51:00.040 --> 51:04.040
record where I'll add in these keywords that I see coming up over and over with good search volume.

51:04.040 --> 51:08.280
Yeah, what's up, Nick? I know a couple of different ideas that I would find this,

51:08.280 --> 51:15.400
but for somebody that may be asking, let's say that Gina thinks of a brand new service. She's

51:15.400 --> 51:24.280
like, I'm going to go into excavation or demolition. How do you go about finding out what's the main

51:24.280 --> 51:29.240
keyword? Do you just go off of what it's called and use your intuition and say, well, if it's

51:29.240 --> 51:33.800
excavation, it's probably excavation. Let me look at the difference between excavation and

51:33.800 --> 51:39.400
excavation contractor, excavation company. How do you determine that main keyword? I'm curious

51:39.400 --> 51:43.400
how you do it. I'll let you guys know how I would do it and how I would find it really quickly.

51:44.120 --> 51:48.840
Yeah, I would love to hear Nick's answer to this. I think this requires just a little bit of

51:50.280 --> 51:54.040
speculation, but making just sort of informed guesses. For example, there's a difference

51:54.040 --> 52:00.520
as in industries. If I just type in concrete, that is not going to give me the results that I want.

52:00.520 --> 52:07.480
If I just do straight up concrete, if we just use a tried and true example, there's 1900 searches,

52:07.480 --> 52:13.880
but that's not what I want because people are going to use that to find ready mix and delivery

52:13.880 --> 52:19.000
by the yard or whatever. But if I do demolition, and I know this because I've had campaigns that

52:19.000 --> 52:28.920
run ads and I've seen my organic clicks, demolition is likely going to, you can't buy just a demolition

52:28.920 --> 52:33.960
product. You know what I'm saying? It's not a product and a service. It's an action. It's a

52:33.960 --> 52:41.080
service. You're doing demolition. Now, what do they mean by that? Do they mean interior

52:41.080 --> 52:47.000
remodeling demo? That's very different than destroying a structure, removing it away,

52:47.000 --> 52:51.400
and then clearing the land. That's going to be more likely to be a demolition contractor.

52:51.400 --> 52:58.120
But in this case, that keyword or demolition company is a good one. In that case, I will look

52:58.120 --> 53:06.760
at the keyword and I will make a judgment about, okay, this is not a product. Concrete is the

53:06.760 --> 53:15.400
product, but it's also a keyword that is going to be used in concrete contractor. I want to make

53:15.400 --> 53:21.400
an assessment about whether this is going to be likely someone calling for someone to do this

53:21.400 --> 53:27.080
specialty service. In this case, demolition would be one that I would add. A demolition contractor

53:27.080 --> 53:33.240
very often would add that to. Concrete would not add that. Concrete contractor would be a great

53:33.240 --> 53:38.680
one. It varies by industry. I just really make a judgment call about really what the search volume

53:38.680 --> 53:42.360
looks like and how I would search for it, frankly. What would you do, Nick?

53:44.360 --> 53:50.040
I would be lazy and just tick-tapping other people's work. I'd go to some major cities,

53:50.600 --> 53:55.640
type in what I think it is, type in demolition. I'd look at the top three results in the organic,

53:56.440 --> 54:01.000
and I would look at the page title because those guys most likely are paying SEO companies. Make

54:01.000 --> 54:07.480
sure it's big cities, competitive cities, Atlanta, L.A., whatever. I guarantee the page title, the

54:07.480 --> 54:13.080
thing that shows up in the SERPs, the first word or the first two words is going to be demolition

54:13.080 --> 54:17.480
service, demolition service. That would be an interesting one to look at right there, demolition

54:17.480 --> 54:22.040
contractor. I would look at three, four cities and then I would come up with two, three ideas.

54:22.040 --> 54:27.640
Then I would go pump it into RankinRent engine and I would see which one. Again, this is just when

54:27.640 --> 54:31.080
you go into a new niche. This is why it's so important to stay in the same niche because

54:32.600 --> 54:36.600
concrete, me and you, we can just go off the top of our head and know our keyword list.

54:38.600 --> 54:40.280
I'm curious to see what demolition service is.

54:41.960 --> 54:44.920
It's going to pull up 10, but let's do a bigger...

54:52.120 --> 54:56.200
So it's going to pull up these related keywords and there's...

54:56.200 --> 54:59.800
And that's just to generate ideas. I would go in and do that in like three, four cities and I'd

54:59.800 --> 55:04.680
look, okay, I keep seeing demolition service, I keep seeing demolition contractor and then I would

55:04.680 --> 55:09.480
just look at that inside of this tool and go, all right, this is probably my target keyword.

55:09.480 --> 55:15.400
You could also go to the website, look at the H1, look at the page title, that kind of stuff

55:15.480 --> 55:20.200
right there. Full service demolition. Is that a Legion?

55:21.240 --> 55:21.880
I don't know, man.

55:23.480 --> 55:26.840
It almost looks like it, but then it's, I mean, it's kind of got a brand. They did a good job

55:26.840 --> 55:33.560
with it is. So again, these are just some ideas, but once again, this is the reason why you guys,

55:33.560 --> 55:39.000
if you go and you take the time to learn a niche, you don't have to keep... There you go.

55:39.000 --> 55:39.960
That's a Legion site.

55:40.760 --> 55:44.600
Yeah, we've built that for one of my students.

55:45.240 --> 55:45.960
Oh, there you go.

55:47.000 --> 55:52.040
This is a lead generator in Atlanta and you can see that he's made it in, right? So look how...

55:52.600 --> 55:58.920
Then that's a good looking site. Go up again, it's best demolition service.

55:59.880 --> 56:00.840
Oh, you're looking at the...

56:03.720 --> 56:08.680
The headline, yeah, right there. Demolition contractor, sorry. Yeah, that's another good

56:08.680 --> 56:13.320
thing. If you could find a lead generator, it doesn't necessarily mean they know what

56:13.320 --> 56:16.600
they're doing, but usually they know what they're doing more than everybody else. And if they're

56:16.600 --> 56:21.720
ranking, they probably know what they're doing. So these are just ideas. You could also ask in

56:21.720 --> 56:28.120
the group if you want. That's another idea, you know? But these are just when you're going

56:28.120 --> 56:32.120
into a new niche. And I just wanted to bring that up because she asked to build a keyword

56:32.280 --> 56:38.760
list from scratch. So again, guys, you could stick with how we do it until I'm continuing

56:38.760 --> 56:44.840
to do it, but I might, based on this, now that we're using rank and run engine, the version 3.0

56:44.840 --> 56:50.360
might have a slightly different way that we do it if it's faster, if it's more accurate, et cetera.

56:51.640 --> 56:53.560
So that's why I was curious to see your process.

56:54.360 --> 56:59.880
Totally, man. Yeah, it's great being on this call with you guys. Looking at the

57:00.840 --> 57:04.200
the fundamentals and constantly revisiting the fundamentals. I think that there's a lot

57:04.200 --> 57:08.120
of entrepreneurs that are very, very successful that I listen to that talk about, you know,

57:08.120 --> 57:13.240
revisiting your business model from first principles over and over and over and over again,

57:13.240 --> 57:16.200
right? Because there's people that are not doing that. They're getting left in the dust because

57:16.200 --> 57:22.280
the world changes, search changes, search volume changes. And I love that Digital Landlords is

57:22.280 --> 57:27.320
always thinking about like, how do we make sure that we're going to consistently get results for

57:27.320 --> 57:30.360
students? It's cool talking about this with you guys today.

57:31.320 --> 57:34.600
Gina, just to clarify Gina's question before we end this, she said, I'm just a little thrown off

57:34.600 --> 57:38.120
by her searching for it, I guess. Do you always search for Tennessee or do you choose a large

57:38.120 --> 57:43.800
city? I think it kind of goes back to the whole concept of like, people are people are people.

57:44.920 --> 57:48.600
The thinking with the Google Trends is that you can kind of cast a wider net.

57:49.480 --> 57:56.600
And so I think for now, I still like the, let me ask this, can you search on rank and

57:56.600 --> 58:00.920
rent without putting in a city and just go globally or nationwide? Or do you have to put

58:00.920 --> 58:06.280
in a city? It's made for local search. Okay. So maybe what you could do, Gina,

58:06.280 --> 58:13.800
to start to start to get ideas is just use trends to find those main terms and then come

58:13.800 --> 58:17.240
into rank and rent in the city you're looking at and then start going from there.

58:18.600 --> 58:23.160
Yeah. Yeah. I think, again, let's talk about earlier, like we were zoomed out

58:23.960 --> 58:27.880
and we were looking at trends, we were talking about JetCheap ET and prompting it for search.

58:28.600 --> 58:33.880
And then we zoom in the next part and we look at, you know, at the city level, right? The state

58:33.880 --> 58:38.840
city level and see like, okay, what is it actually? We know what the trend is and saying, hey, here's

58:38.840 --> 58:43.480
the trend, but what is in reality, right? Because we got to make a decision about whether it's a

58:43.480 --> 58:49.640
Bible market based on the very specific data as we have it for that area. Yeah.

58:49.640 --> 58:57.720
Yeah. Anyway, beautiful. Well, Jahil just joined and then Corey helped him out. He said 50th low

58:57.720 --> 59:04.200
competition. If you want to be very conservative, Jahil 70 is the very bottom of the list if you

59:04.200 --> 59:13.000
want to be very conservative. But, you know, this is what we found right now. As we roll out version

59:13.000 --> 59:18.520
3.0, I'm going to keep testing. I'm going to keep looking at this. Now I can go into rank and rent

59:18.520 --> 59:24.200
engine, refresh it and see if anything changed right before I release it and see if those numbers

59:24.200 --> 59:32.760
are any different. But as of right now, standing November 5th, 2024, 50 with a low competition

59:32.760 --> 59:39.240
and 70 with a medium competition. And that is that. So I also want to just mention one more thing.

59:39.240 --> 59:43.960
I do appreciate, I see those of you that post your wins and share your success and everything,

59:43.960 --> 59:49.320
I know it takes time. But I know, I don't know about you, Ryan, but when I was in these groups,

59:49.320 --> 59:54.360
like just learning the ropes, dude, I would feed off of these posts. When I saw people, even if

59:54.360 --> 59:57.960
they just got their first lead in, they just got their first website up, they just, you know,

59:57.960 --> 01:00:03.800
sometimes hearing about somebody's like failure even gave me encouragement. Like, hey, I just

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.800
cold called this business owner. I got kicked in the teeth and whatever. So anyway, I just want

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:11.480
to let you guys know, I really appreciate you guys sharing those wins in this group and the free group

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:16.760
and that it's complete social proof. It helps us a ton. And just to want you guys know that I

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:23.720
noticed that. So anything else you want to add, Ryan? Thanks for having me on, man. I am always

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:30.440
happy to be with you guys and Digital Landlords. I love this group and I agree with what Nick said.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:37.800
You know, I think that I have my failures. I have, you know, to get to $87,000 a month was a bumpy

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:44.680
road. I screwed up so many things, made so many mistakes, got told no so many times, lost Bo's.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:51.000
This is part of what we do, right? Like you're going to have success look like this, you know,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.040
and it's fun to watch people getting closes and wins and things like that. But behind every one

01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:01.960
of those, there's no's and there's, you know, people that are, you know, laser focused and

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:07.320
don't give up and then they post their wins. So it's fun to be on this journey with you guys. And

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:12.680
I'm glad to be on the call today. Well, Ryan, appreciate you, bro. And guys, again, for those

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:20.920
of you that did not get the beta discount, if you guys want to give RankinRant Engine a try with,

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:25.800
again, just for, just so everybody knows, you do not have to use this tool. It is just the tool

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.520
that I'm going to be using exclusively. You're going to see it at the training. You're going to

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:34.280
see me referencing it in every single aspect of this because we actually have Ryan who can control

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:39.480
this tool. But you don't have to use it. If you guys want to, you know, throw some stuff together,

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:44.040
use the sheets and the whole deal, I did that. But what I'm telling you is from experience,

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:49.720
it's better to just start and build a proper foundation and scale it up than throw together

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:54.920
a duct tape business and try to retroactively fix it. That is very, very difficult. It's so

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.120
much easier if you build it from the ground up, you have your projects lined out, you have your

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.040
tasks lined out, you have your freaking due diligence. It's all in one place. You log in,

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:07.240
boom, boom, boom. You have one tool you need, done. But again, I don't want anyone to feel like they

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.160
have to. But if you guys are interested, message me. I have a coupon code for you guys. Those of

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:16.360
you that didn't get the beta discount, we have something for you. And with that said, we'll see

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:22.520
you on the next call, Ryan. Cool. Thanks for having me on. Go close and flash. Go get some deals. It's

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.760
only freaking Tuesday. We got time, man. It's Tuesday morning for you guys. We got time to go

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.760
sling some freaking deals this week, man. By the way, let me mention one more thing.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:36.360
Today's Election Day, everyone's kind of been weird because it's like, I don't know what's going

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.560
to happen. Well, hopefully after today, maybe by Saturday. I know I was reading earlier, like

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:49.400
the George Bush Al Gore one took a couple weeks. But it seems like after this, whatever happens,

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.640
people at least have some clarity. And I feel like that things start to become a little bit normal,

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:58.840
at least until the holidays. And then it gets a little weird. But I know that the economy's weird,

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:04.360
people are uncertain. So I'm super optimistic because no matter what, people are always anxious.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:08.680
After today, tomorrow, this week, we should start seeing things normalize a little bit. So

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.920
I'm kind of looking forward to that. A hundred percent. A hundred percent.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.360
Okay guys, talk soon. Appreciate it, Ryan. Thanks for having me on, man. See you.
