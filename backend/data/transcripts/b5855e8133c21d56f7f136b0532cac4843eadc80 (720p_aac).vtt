00:00.000 --> 00:10.360
Okay. Beautiful. Okay. So guys, uh, welcome to our first, uh, not our first training,

00:10.360 --> 00:16.680
but our first training with this format. Um, the reason I wanted to shift to this is because,

00:16.680 --> 00:22.160
and I don't know if you guys follow me on, on social media or I don't care if you do,

00:22.160 --> 00:27.600
if you want to, that's great. If you don't, it's fine. But as I've gotten like more into

00:27.600 --> 00:34.080
business, I've realized that quality is always better than quantity. And I think in the beginning,

00:34.080 --> 00:37.760
when I started my Facebook group, definitely when I had my, you know, my social media,

00:37.760 --> 00:42.640
it was always like, how many likes, how many live viewers can you get? How many group members,

00:42.640 --> 00:47.600
all these different things. And that's just kind of natural as humans. And, um, I realized that,

00:47.600 --> 00:51.760
like, I was talking to a lot of people that weren't even interested in taking action.

00:52.640 --> 00:57.440
And so the whole purpose of doing these kinds of calls is I want to give more value on

00:57.440 --> 01:01.600
to be able to give you guys more value. The people that are receptive and are actually

01:01.600 --> 01:06.880
ready to implement what I'm going to teach today, they're ready to take action. You're the ones that

01:06.880 --> 01:11.760
I want to give priority to. So this is the new format going forward. Okay. Now, just because you

01:11.760 --> 01:14.720
were on today's call doesn't mean that you can't be on next week's call, but we are going to be

01:14.720 --> 01:19.280
doing these live every single Monday. Um, and we're going to be doing them at the same time,

01:19.280 --> 01:24.480
just to keep consistent. The only time that would change is if I am in the air, which I'm going to

01:24.480 --> 01:28.880
try not to do a flight on a Monday. So, um, I know it's a little early for some of you guys.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.840
It's like six 30 for MST. I'm in Dubai. So I'm trying to like, it's like a 10 hour difference.

01:33.840 --> 01:38.640
I'm trying to do my best, but, um, really truthfully, I do not care. And Aaron and I,

01:38.640 --> 01:43.200
when we put up this post, we were like, dude, it was, you know, it's our first time doing it.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.400
And we're like, we probably won't have a ton of engagement because we're going to get this post

01:46.400 --> 01:50.560
up late. And we had like 50 plus people that commented. I don't know if all of them got the

01:50.560 --> 01:56.240
link, but, um, I don't really care about how many people are on this call. And I promise you,

01:56.240 --> 01:59.840
even if one of you, I showed up, I'm going to run this call because I prepared for it. And

01:59.840 --> 02:03.760
that's what I'm going to do. So again, like I told you guys, I'm not going to be posting this

02:03.760 --> 02:08.080
anywhere else. That's just going to be here. So, um, keep in mind guys, what I'm going to be sharing

02:08.080 --> 02:13.280
today, uh, it's not going to give you guys a hundred percent of the information that you need

02:13.840 --> 02:19.760
to build a successful digital real estate agency. Um, like there's no way I can cover that in 40

02:19.760 --> 02:24.320
minutes. And I just want to like start with that. There's no way I can cover everything in 40

02:24.320 --> 02:29.600
minutes period. And, and truthfully speaking, that's why we created digital landlords. Everything's on

02:29.600 --> 02:36.720
the inside. However, um, my goal on this call is literally to do exactly what I did, what I used

02:36.720 --> 02:43.120
to build my, my agency, my rank and rent digital real estate agency to seven figures. And you guys

02:43.120 --> 02:48.640
know that like at the, at the core of what I believe is that we always give value before we

02:48.640 --> 02:53.360
even ask for a conversation before we even ask to like talk about business, talk about doing business

02:53.360 --> 02:59.600
together. We give value and our value is giving them what they want and what they want is our

02:59.600 --> 03:05.520
leads. Right. And so really that like my whole belief is like give ridiculous value upfront,

03:06.560 --> 03:12.320
charge nothing for it, right. Give value. That's so good. Give leads that are so good. They might

03:12.320 --> 03:20.080
even, they hopefully will make money from those leads and like just give them that real,

03:20.080 --> 03:24.480
those real exclusive leads, absolutely free. Right. That's, that's the whole, like that's at

03:24.480 --> 03:29.200
the core of our strategy. And the reason that we do that is because guys, the hardest objection

03:29.200 --> 03:32.320
to overcome, if you've done sales, if you haven't done sales, it doesn't matter, but you'll learn

03:32.320 --> 03:39.840
this. The hardest objection to overcome is trust. I don't care how good your product is, how good it

03:39.840 --> 03:46.640
looks, how good your website is, how nice your polo is and your brand. And if people do not trust

03:46.640 --> 03:51.120
you, they will not buy from you. And that's just the reality. And on, on the flip side, you could

03:51.120 --> 03:56.640
be in your mom's basement. You could look like grungy and not that professional. And if people

03:56.640 --> 04:01.680
trust you, they are going to buy from you. Okay. And so the reason we give the free leads is we

04:01.680 --> 04:06.000
know that the hardest objection to overcome is trust. And that is the very thing that overcomes

04:06.000 --> 04:12.240
trust. So ultimately, when we give leads, our purpose isn't to give leads, just to be a good

04:12.240 --> 04:16.960
person. Our goal is to give free leads so that they will eventually work with us. And that's

04:16.960 --> 04:20.320
the whole strategy. And then we're not hiding that. And I'll tell my business owners, when I call a

04:20.320 --> 04:25.360
business owner, I'm like, Hey, hey, Pete, I want to give you a couple of free leads. Look, just to be

04:25.360 --> 04:29.680
completely straight with you, I want to earn your business. That's my goal here. However, I don't

04:29.680 --> 04:35.360
even want to talk about it until I've given you, until I've let you try out my business at absolutely

04:35.360 --> 04:39.040
no charge. Basically, I'm going to give you some free leads. So guys, I want to let you guys know

04:39.040 --> 04:43.440
upfront that for me, that is no different. I've never hit that. And so at the end of the day,

04:43.440 --> 04:46.960
the reason I have the Facebook group, the reason I add value, the reason I'm doing calls like this

04:46.960 --> 04:50.800
is that I want to earn your business, right? At some point, whether it's digital landlord or

04:50.800 --> 04:55.120
something else that I'm doing, I want to earn your business eventually. Okay. I want you, just like

04:55.120 --> 04:59.360
I want your business owners to be so impressed with your free stuff, with your free leads,

05:00.000 --> 05:05.840
that not only can they not wait to get more, but you leave them or I leave you wondering like, dude,

05:05.840 --> 05:09.280
what would it be like to be able to get on calls with this guy every single week to have access

05:09.280 --> 05:12.880
to this guy every single week to be, have access to that energy every single week inside of his

05:12.880 --> 05:19.040
group, inside of his like inner circle. And so anyway, long story short guys, that is the whole

05:19.040 --> 05:22.960
purpose. And I don't ever want this to come across like I'm this magnificent person that just wants

05:22.960 --> 05:28.560
to give stuff away. No matter what it is, there's always something in it for everybody. And so for

05:28.560 --> 05:32.640
me, I just understand that if you give value upfront without asking for anything,

05:32.640 --> 05:36.480
then the people that are ready will eventually buy. And so that's, that's why I want to do these

05:36.480 --> 05:41.440
more intimate sessions. Cause if you're on this call right now, it's because you are looking to

05:41.440 --> 05:46.640
either take your current business to a new level or to start getting into this business. Okay.

05:46.640 --> 05:51.760
So that said guys, if at any time during this, I think what I'll do, Aaron, can you still hear me

05:51.760 --> 05:58.320
by the way? I don't see. Yeah, you're good. Okay. Cool. What I'll have you do is,

06:01.200 --> 06:06.560
yeah. Are you, does it say your co-host still? Yeah. Okay. Then we'll just leave it like that.

06:06.560 --> 06:10.800
Just keep an eye on stuff and then let me know if you see anything come in. Okay. I got you.

06:12.160 --> 06:18.880
Okay. Guys, all that said, just to get that out of the way upfront, we, it is 42. This is probably

06:18.880 --> 06:25.120
going to be, I'd say 25 to 30 minutes. What I'm going to talk about right now, maybe less.

06:25.120 --> 06:29.520
And then I want to have some time for some questions. Okay. So I want to get right into

06:29.520 --> 06:35.760
what I want to talk about today. And essentially what I want to do is I want to preface this whole

06:35.760 --> 06:41.120
concept of picking the perfect city. And then I want to talk about like the, the, the, the,

06:41.120 --> 06:45.920
the, there's like, to me, I wrote down rules, right? That I have for picking the perfect city.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.240
And so basically I'm going to give you my rules for picking the perfect city.

06:50.240 --> 06:54.080
And they're kind of basically like tips and things that I live by their principles that I live by

06:54.080 --> 06:58.000
when picking the perfect city. So that's going to be the format of this, but this is, I want you

06:58.000 --> 07:02.400
guys to know, this is from somebody that has, I've actually analyzed personally over a thousand

07:02.400 --> 07:07.920
niche and city combinations. Okay. Personally, that's not including my VA's that I trained to

07:07.920 --> 07:11.760
do. However many else I have done this so many times, it's ridiculous. I've looked at so many

07:11.760 --> 07:16.080
cities. I know some of the weirdest cities. In fact, I'll meet people sometimes and they'll be

07:16.080 --> 07:19.840
like, yeah, I'm from Virginia. And then I'll be like, oh, which part? They're like, well,

07:19.840 --> 07:23.040
you don't know. And I'm like, you'd be surprised. And they'll tell me to sit them like, oh yeah,

07:23.040 --> 07:25.840
I know where that's at. And they're like, how do you, I'm like, because I've looked at maps,

07:25.840 --> 07:31.840
like I'm a geography teacher. So I've done this a lot guys. And that's why I know like what I'm

07:31.840 --> 07:34.720
talking about. And I don't want you to trust that. I know what I'm talking about. I want you to put

07:34.720 --> 07:40.400
this into practice and basically like test what I'm talking about. Okay. So a little bit of preface.

07:42.400 --> 07:47.600
Hands down, this is the most important step in the process. And I genuinely mean that if you look at

07:47.600 --> 07:53.440
my material inside of digital landlords, when I built it, I didn't even realize this. But as I

07:53.440 --> 07:59.920
started like recording, like my material of the process I was doing, I'm like, oh my gosh, my

07:59.920 --> 08:07.440
section on niche selection and picking the perfect city, the due diligence process is the biggest

08:07.520 --> 08:11.600
section in our training, which would blew my mind because I never even realized. I thought it was

08:11.600 --> 08:17.040
like maybe the closing or whatever. This right here guys is the most important step in the process,

08:17.040 --> 08:21.680
because if you do this correctly, it makes everything else easier. If you do it incorrectly,

08:21.680 --> 08:27.040
everything else is going to be harder. Okay. So there's a reason why today I'm not starting

08:27.040 --> 08:31.520
off with talking about niches. I'm not starting off with talking about niche ideas, which we may

08:31.520 --> 08:35.200
get into in the future because it's always a fun topic to generate ideas, tell you guys about new

08:35.200 --> 08:40.480
niches. And the reason why, and again, these are just some preface points I want to come up with

08:40.480 --> 08:47.040
and want to remind you of is that I am a huge believer, okay, that you should be going into

08:47.040 --> 08:54.080
boring niches, AKA tried and true niches until you have retired yourself. Okay. And by the way,

08:54.080 --> 08:58.160
when I say retired yourself, that means you have enough money coming in from this model

08:58.160 --> 09:03.520
that your bills are paid for and you no longer have to work a job and everything else is gravy.

09:03.520 --> 09:07.920
Okay. So whatever your number is, if you're a college student and, you know, you live on

09:07.920 --> 09:11.840
ketchup and potato chips, you have a car that's paid for and you live in your mom's basement,

09:11.840 --> 09:17.360
which I, no judgment, you're in a great position. You might only need one deal and then you're

09:17.360 --> 09:21.760
covered and everything else you can go take a chance, you can take a risk on. Until you hit

09:21.760 --> 09:26.720
that point, I'm a huge believer, stick to the tried and true, stick to the boring, because it

09:26.720 --> 09:30.960
eliminates half the equation. You got to get the niche right, you got to get the city right,

09:30.960 --> 09:34.560
you got to get the combination right. So if we can eliminate one of it, which is the niche,

09:34.560 --> 09:37.760
we already know concrete is good. We already know artificial grass is good. We already know that

09:38.400 --> 09:41.520
spray foam is good. We already know that masonry is good. We already know that fencing is good.

09:41.520 --> 09:46.240
We already know that tree service works. We've just eliminated 50% of the equation.

09:46.240 --> 09:54.080
Now we could focus on this part, which is getting extremely good at the city. Okay. So as a reminder,

09:55.440 --> 09:58.720
like if something works, like what you're going to find out is you're going to be okay,

09:58.720 --> 10:02.080
I'm going to follow Nick's advice, and then you're going to get to like 5,000 a month.

10:02.080 --> 10:06.240
Okay. And you're going to realize like, why the heck would I go chase some crazy niche when I

10:06.240 --> 10:10.240
know this works and I can just do it again and again and again and again. And that's what I did

10:10.240 --> 10:13.520
is I was like, I'm going to get to this like certain point. And then I'm going to start

10:13.520 --> 10:17.440
looking at that. Like, you know, the riches are in the niches. I'm going to find that crazy one

10:17.440 --> 10:21.600
no one's ever talked about. And then I got to like 15, 20, 30 and like, dude, I'm just going

10:21.600 --> 10:26.400
to keep going. Like, I don't, I don't care what niche it's in. Just, I care about the money.

10:26.400 --> 10:30.800
Right. So just as a reminder, that's why I'm talking about the city. I'm not necessarily

10:30.800 --> 10:34.480
talking about niche and city. I'm talking about just city because I'm assuming you guys are not

10:34.480 --> 10:37.840
stupid. And I'm assuming you guys are going to listen to what I'm saying and realize, oh,

10:37.840 --> 10:42.240
that makes sense. Let me eliminate half the equation. And I only have to solve half of it.

10:42.240 --> 10:46.080
Focus on the city, go into the boring niches. I'm not saying you have to do concrete, talk a lot

10:46.080 --> 10:51.200
about concrete, but do a boring niche, focus on getting good at picking a city, go get yourself

10:51.200 --> 10:56.080
out of the rat race, retire yourself, quit your job. And now you could start

10:56.080 --> 11:01.280
messing around with new niches. Okay. So, um, a couple more things really quick. I bought a

11:01.280 --> 11:06.720
program back in 2016, my very first program that taught me how to do this stuff. And, um, that

11:06.720 --> 11:11.920
program had an antiquated process for picking a city and niche. It had an antiquated process. And

11:12.480 --> 11:17.200
it to fair in fairness to the person that created this program, I believe that their process at one

11:17.200 --> 11:22.320
point did work. I believe it was really good, probably like three years before. But by the time

11:22.320 --> 11:26.320
I got into it, by the time I was serious about it and I was actually following the advice, it was

11:26.320 --> 11:30.880
antiquated. Okay. Um, a couple of things that were wrong with it. Number one, and you guys might have

11:30.880 --> 11:34.720
heard this in other programs. Some of you guys, I guess a lot of you guys probably bought other

11:34.720 --> 11:39.200
programs and I want you to listen to what I'm saying. You probably will relate. I kept hearing

11:39.200 --> 11:43.040
the same thing over and over. The riches are in the niches, the riches are in the niches,

11:43.040 --> 11:46.480
the riches are in the niches. And I just believed it. I was like, yeah, that makes sense. Right? Like

11:46.480 --> 11:50.000
if I can go into something that no one's ever thought of, I can completely dominate that niche

11:50.000 --> 11:54.720
and I'll just be the only one. And it's completely wide open, blue ocean, whatever. And so guys,

11:54.720 --> 12:00.880
I spent six months doing basically a website in every single niche. You can think of all the

12:00.880 --> 12:04.160
ones that you probably shouldn't go into and all the ones you guys have thought of the plumber,

12:04.160 --> 12:09.680
the HVAC, the electrician, the carpet cleaner, the towing. I mean, all the ones that I hate,

12:09.680 --> 12:13.920
I did because I, I just was told, you know, the riches are in the niches and you need to test all

12:13.920 --> 12:19.280
this different stuff. And I was thinking, I spent hours analyzing niches and looking at home advisors,

12:19.280 --> 12:24.320
different, you know, niche categories and looking at billboards and looking at flyers in the mail

12:24.320 --> 12:30.160
and like so much time. And then I would build, let me try this. Guys, I had this bag of websites

12:30.160 --> 12:36.480
with no money coming in. Okay. That was number one. And so I ended up with basically a website

12:36.480 --> 12:41.520
in every possible niche you could think of with very little money. Okay. And the money that I did

12:41.520 --> 12:46.640
have coming in was in the tried and true niches. Go figure. Right. Okay. And the crazy part is guys,

12:46.640 --> 12:55.600
is I continued on this for like three years from 2016 until the end of 2019. I continued just not

12:55.600 --> 12:59.360
listening to the, like the advice I'm giving you right now and just following that training,

12:59.360 --> 13:03.440
which was like, keep building in niches and you're one day going to find it. And three years in,

13:03.440 --> 13:08.240
I was making eight to $10,000 a month. I was, by the way, making less than I was doing door to door

13:08.240 --> 13:14.240
sales, working more hours. And by this point, I had stacked up 60,000. If you guys don't know

13:14.240 --> 13:21.760
my story, then I, at this point I'm $60,000 in debt. Okay. And like, I just felt completely

13:21.760 --> 13:26.240
hopeless. And luckily I realized this still was the perfect model, but there were just some,

13:26.240 --> 13:30.480
some problems with the training that I was in. And I needed, one of them was I need to figure out

13:30.480 --> 13:35.760
how to pick up the right city and the right niche combination. Okay. And so anyway, long story short,

13:35.760 --> 13:40.880
guys, is that what I realized is that, and this is something you guys need to remember.

13:40.880 --> 13:46.400
If you go into a boring niche, and I'm going to say boring as in tried and true, concrete,

13:46.400 --> 13:50.720
tree service, spray foam, all the stuff we thought of, everyone else has probably thought of it too.

13:50.720 --> 13:58.640
Right. Which means you need to find an obscure or a weird city. Okay. And so what do you think about,

13:58.640 --> 14:02.320
what do you think everyone else is looking at? When they pull up a map, they're looking at all

14:02.320 --> 14:05.360
the cities that you could see. You know, when you pull up a map, you could see Raleigh, North

14:05.360 --> 14:09.600
Carolina, Salt Lake City, Utah, Las Vegas, Nevada, and then you zoom in a little bit more,

14:09.600 --> 14:14.560
maybe it's going to show the next layer. Right. If it's a city you know of,

14:15.280 --> 14:19.680
probably everyone else knows of it. Okay. So just remember if it's a boring niche,

14:19.680 --> 14:24.480
you're going to need an obscure city, a city that no one, that the average person wouldn't

14:24.480 --> 14:28.960
think to look at unless they'd been trained to look like I'm going to train you today. Okay.

14:29.680 --> 14:36.560
And on the flip side is if you guys can do the opposite, which is if at some point you find that

14:36.560 --> 14:43.600
weird niche, then you have the ability to go into more boring or big cities because no one really

14:43.600 --> 14:48.080
is in that niche. Okay. But it's much easier in my opinion, because everyone's trying to focus

14:48.080 --> 14:54.320
on the weird niche and the big city to go into the boring niche and the obscure city, because no one

14:54.320 --> 14:59.040
wants to go into the obscure cities. No one wants to go into Bentonville, Arkansas. Nobody wants to

14:59.040 --> 15:03.760
go into Queen Creek, Arizona. Nobody wants to go into these places because it's not what you hear

15:03.760 --> 15:09.360
of it. It takes effort. It takes knowing what to look for. Okay. So basically guys, I started

15:09.360 --> 15:15.280
testing this. I realized that like, okay, why don't I just focus on the boring niches? Why don't I

15:15.280 --> 15:20.960
focus on the stuff that I know works? Right. And then I'll focus on the cities. And I started

15:20.960 --> 15:24.960
doing this, and I picked one niche at the beginning of 2020. And I said, I'm going to

15:24.960 --> 15:30.080
focus on one niche. That was Tree Service. And I had a bunch of other sites that were ranking

15:30.080 --> 15:33.600
generating leads. I'm like, and I'll try to sell these at the same time. Guys, I focused on Tree

15:33.600 --> 15:39.280
Service. And that is the year that we did seven figures. We went from eight to $10,000 a month in

15:40.080 --> 15:49.120
December of 2019. In July, we did $100,000 a month. It's bananas. Looking back on it, I didn't even

15:49.120 --> 15:54.000
realize the wave I was riding, but it was just working. And I didn't have time to step back and

15:54.000 --> 15:57.360
look at like, oh my gosh, we're growing. I didn't even know we did $100,000 that month until the

15:57.360 --> 16:02.560
month got over. And I started looking at the Stripe accounts. I was like, oh my gosh, we did it.

16:02.560 --> 16:11.440
We did $100,000. And it just continued from there. So this is exactly one of the primary pieces of

16:11.440 --> 16:17.040
the puzzle before I was able to scale is dialing in this process. And unfortunately for me,

16:17.040 --> 16:21.600
nobody could teach it to me because I didn't know anyone that was actually making big money

16:21.600 --> 16:24.560
in this business. They were all making big money selling coaching programs.

16:26.080 --> 16:30.720
But fortunately for you guys, I've done it. I figured it out and I'm going to share it with you.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.280
And so basically what happened from there, guys, to wrap this up,

16:36.560 --> 16:41.120
for those of you that don't know me, seven figures in 2020, just barely over a million. We just

16:42.080 --> 16:49.280
barely passed it. 2021, I did $1.45 million. And then by the end of 2021, my inbox was inundated

16:49.280 --> 16:54.640
with people asking me how the hell I was selling so many deals and had the same training as them.

16:54.640 --> 16:58.400
And I was doing everything completely different because you guys know I do pre-selling.

16:58.400 --> 17:04.480
And I kind of shifted the model on its head and figured this out. And so in 2021, at the very end,

17:04.480 --> 17:10.400
it was like December 1st, we launched Digital Landlords. So that's the story. And that's why

17:10.400 --> 17:14.320
maybe you ought to listen to me. And you also don't have to. So guys, let's talk about

17:16.080 --> 17:21.840
these rules that I have. These are principles that I have. And I would highly encourage you guys to

17:21.840 --> 17:30.880
take notes if you can. Take notes of what I'm about to say because these are principles that

17:30.880 --> 17:36.400
I like legitimately, if I'm doing a city, it has to check these boxes. So I'm just going to

17:36.400 --> 17:40.880
go through these. And then any questions you guys have, I'm going to let you guys ask them.

17:40.880 --> 17:45.840
Okay, so here's these are my principles for picking a good city. Obviously, guys,

17:45.840 --> 17:49.280
like I told you at the beginning, this isn't I want you guys to remember, this isn't like

17:49.280 --> 17:53.760
enough information to just go build a seven figure agency, because I can't cover that in 40 minutes

17:53.760 --> 17:59.600
or, you know, whatever. But this is enough to get you started. To get the wheels turning to get you

17:59.600 --> 18:03.760
guys like thinking in the right direction and putting your focus in the right direction. Okay.

18:04.720 --> 18:08.960
So here's the rules that I live by here, the principles I live by when picking the perfect

18:08.960 --> 18:14.480
city. Again, coming from doing this over 1000 times again coming from making millions of dollars,

18:14.480 --> 18:20.240
not selling my program digital landlords, not doing consulting, but doing exactly what you guys

18:20.240 --> 18:25.200
are doing, which is building simple websites, ranking them on Google, renting them out. In my

18:25.200 --> 18:31.040
case, I like to rent them out, then build them, and then make the money completely backwards,

18:31.120 --> 18:35.680
but you get the concept. Okay. So guys, let's go through this. Number one, guys, and these aren't

18:35.680 --> 18:40.320
in no particular order, but they all matter. Number one, number one rule, number one principle

18:40.880 --> 18:47.920
for picking the perfect city is that population does not matter. Okay, now I know that it in

18:47.920 --> 18:52.560
many courses, by the way, if you are in a course, I promise you I've been in it, I have it. I know

18:52.560 --> 18:59.360
who they are, probably a friend of mine. Maybe not, but population doesn't matter. It's crazy.

18:59.360 --> 19:04.080
The first training I got told me that I should look at population. I can't remember like 100,000

19:04.080 --> 19:12.240
to 250 or 500. It was based on population. Okay. Population does not matter. Here's why.

19:12.240 --> 19:19.440
Let me tell you what does matter. Search volume, the demand, search volume relative,

19:19.440 --> 19:25.760
that's what you guys should remember, search volume relative to competition is what matters.

19:25.760 --> 19:33.120
Okay. Let me repeat that. Population does not matter. Search volume relative to competition

19:33.680 --> 19:39.760
does matter. Okay. And I always give this example. If I were to offer you a website and I said,

19:39.760 --> 19:44.480
I'm going to gift you one of my websites, I'm going to give, I have so many ranking websites

19:44.480 --> 19:48.640
and you've got two options. Okay. Number one option, and this is by the way, it's going to

19:48.640 --> 19:53.840
be an artificial grass. I'm going to give you, you can either get a website that's ranked in,

19:54.480 --> 20:01.760
you know, Manhattan, New York, one of the most populous cities ever, I think. In fact,

20:01.760 --> 20:07.440
maybe I better check. I think it's super populated. Maybe I better check before I give you guys.

20:10.240 --> 20:15.760
Hold on. Okay. 1.6 million people. Yeah, that's good. That's a good example. You can have a

20:15.760 --> 20:22.080
website, you can have an artificial grass website in Manhattan, or you could have an artificial

20:22.080 --> 20:30.240
grass website in Queen Creek, Arizona. Both are ranked, both have a GMB. Which one do you choose?

20:30.240 --> 20:37.360
Okay. Now, this kind of extreme example, and I'm using Manhattan because kind of a concrete jungle,

20:37.360 --> 20:42.080
but the point is that if you're going off population, you'd say all day long Manhattan,

20:42.080 --> 20:47.120
right? But anyone that's like lives in Manhattan or knows Manhattan, it's basically like,

20:47.120 --> 20:51.120
it's like apartments, right? It's completely concrete. I know that there's probably some

20:51.120 --> 20:54.960
outskirts and then whatever, whatever, whatever. But you'd know the point that I'm making. Queen

20:54.960 --> 20:59.360
Creek, Arizona, I think it's like 30,000 population. Let me check. It's growing,

20:59.360 --> 21:07.040
which is another one I'm going to talk about. Queen Creek, Arizona population is 59,000. It's

21:07.040 --> 21:14.400
literally like less than a tenth and like less than a twentieth of Manhattan. And I'd probably

21:14.400 --> 21:20.800
take Queen Creek, right? Because Queen Creek, Arizona is an area that checks all the other boxes.

21:21.360 --> 21:25.840
Got a bunch of people looking for turf because of the climate and because it's growing and because

21:25.840 --> 21:30.320
of just a number of different things. So I want you guys to, and I've looked at the numbers and

21:30.320 --> 21:35.520
I would take Queen Creek, which sounds bananas. It sounds crazy, but that's true. So just remember

21:35.520 --> 21:39.920
as my first principle and what you guys should adopt as well. I guess you don't have to, I hate

21:39.920 --> 21:44.560
to say you should, but you should consider is that population doesn't matter. Okay. Again,

21:44.560 --> 21:50.400
this is from experience. This is not because I read it in a book. Number two, I kind of already

21:50.400 --> 21:54.560
alluded to this, but if you can see it on a map, it's probably not going to be worth your time.

21:54.560 --> 22:00.240
Okay. If you pull up in a map, USA, Australia, whatever, I don't, it doesn't matter guys. This

22:00.240 --> 22:04.160
works in, throughout the world, right? Depending on the city you're in, depending on the, how

22:04.160 --> 22:10.320
people search, how people do business. Not every country is great with this yet, but depending

22:10.320 --> 22:15.760
where you pull up in a map, if you can see the city with that opening view or one or two clicks,

22:15.760 --> 22:20.320
one or two zooms, and I probably would go further and say, if you know about the city,

22:20.320 --> 22:25.040
it's probably not where you want to go because most likely it's what everyone knows. If it's

22:25.040 --> 22:30.800
the Salt Lake City, Utah, if it's the Los Angeles, California, if it's the, if it's the Las Vegas,

22:30.800 --> 22:35.920
Nevada, if it's the Denver, Colorado, if it's the Albuquerque, New Mexico, if you're going to be in

22:35.920 --> 22:40.960
the boring niches, like I suggest you're going to want to go into more obscure cities. Okay. So

22:40.960 --> 22:46.000
it's just a quick rule of thumb. If I know about it, if it's like I could see it on a map,

22:46.000 --> 22:50.960
I'm probably not going to go into it. Okay. That's, and again, that is assuming that you're

22:50.960 --> 22:55.360
in a boring niche. And just a quick reminder that if you're in a boring niche, you're going to need

22:55.360 --> 23:01.200
an obscure weird city. And if you're an obscure niche, you can usually find those bigger cities

23:01.200 --> 23:08.160
because no one's in them. But if you can find both a boring niche, like a tree service and a big city

23:08.240 --> 23:14.000
that's got no competition, you have found literal gold. But I would also recommend that you don't

23:14.000 --> 23:19.760
go chasing it because you, it's not worth your time. You usually stumble upon these things. Okay.

23:19.760 --> 23:23.280
Just so you know. Okay. So that's number one. Number one is population doesn't matter. Number

23:23.280 --> 23:28.800
two, if you could see it on a map, it's probably not worth your time. Number three, certain states,

23:28.800 --> 23:33.120
I'm going to talk about the U S on this one. This is applicable to U S and I would guarantee

23:33.120 --> 23:38.320
this is probably applicable to every country and certain cities, but certain states in the U S

23:38.320 --> 23:46.560
suck for ranking. Okay. Certain states suck. And the number one state, if you guys follow my content,

23:46.560 --> 23:52.960
you probably know it's California. I, if you call me and you're one of my family members and you

23:52.960 --> 24:00.480
want leads, that may change my mind for that specific like specific situation. And I would

24:00.480 --> 24:05.360
still probably like think about it. Okay. Other than that, you're not catching me in California.

24:05.360 --> 24:09.520
I've tried it. I've done it. I've been there and I can't even put my finger on what it is.

24:11.280 --> 24:15.280
I just would recommend, I would just recommend you stay out. And maybe some of you guys are thinking

24:15.280 --> 24:18.400
I'm trying to get you to stay out. So I'm going to go and you guys can check with any of my team. I

24:18.400 --> 24:25.040
have zero websites in California. Zero. Well, I did, but for whatever the case is, it seems like

24:25.040 --> 24:29.520
people are, when you, when you cold call, it's, you know, you try to get someone on the hook,

24:29.520 --> 24:34.720
people are leery because someone's always trying to scam them. The leads just seem to be a little

24:34.720 --> 24:40.640
bit kind of weird. You got people that want to overly check the licensing. It's just a weird

24:40.640 --> 24:45.920
state. And again, I can't tell you why I'm just telling you from experience. I'm not going into

24:45.920 --> 24:49.920
California. It's one of my rules. If it's in California, I'm out. Okay. Certain states suck.

24:50.560 --> 24:56.320
Another state that I find very difficult for whatever reason, only from experience is New

24:56.320 --> 25:03.280
Jersey. I don't know why. I don't know what it is, but those two states have been extremely

25:03.280 --> 25:08.080
difficult. I will not go into California. I won't look at New Jersey, but if I get a referral in

25:08.080 --> 25:12.160
New Jersey, I might look at it. But I know it's not something I'm going to go look at. I also

25:12.160 --> 25:16.400
think it's weird because it's set up weird. There's not, it's kind of like just spread out.

25:17.120 --> 25:22.320
Those two states to me are, are terrible. Okay. Prove me wrong. And I'm sure that you can make

25:22.320 --> 25:29.360
money in California. But the thing I look at is like, yeah, I can, but why? Who am I proving?

25:29.360 --> 25:36.000
What am I proving it to who? Right. So, um, certain states suck, namely California. Okay.

25:36.000 --> 25:42.640
That's number three. Number four, weather and seasonality do actually matter guys.

25:43.920 --> 25:49.520
Weather and seasonality do matter. So one of the things that I do, one of my principles is I look

25:49.600 --> 25:55.120
at the states and cities with, with, by the way, real quick, as I'm going through these principles,

25:55.120 --> 25:58.240
if you have follow-up questions to these principles, please start dropping them in

25:58.240 --> 26:03.600
the comments so that we can start getting, um, those questions, um, so that I can just get

26:03.600 --> 26:07.680
through them at the end. So we don't have like a lag. If you have any questions regarding any of

26:07.680 --> 26:13.120
these like principles, I'm giving you these rules, these laws that I follow, just drop them in the

26:13.120 --> 26:19.360
comments. Okay. Weather and seasonality do matter. This is number four. Okay. I always first am when

26:19.360 --> 26:24.560
I'm looking at a, at a specific niche, I'm going to look at the cities that have, and sometimes

26:24.560 --> 26:30.240
it's not the, or sorry, the states that have the most moderate weather. And unfortunately California

26:30.240 --> 26:35.920
sucks because California is like the best moderate weather. Even with the most moderate weather, I'm

26:35.920 --> 26:41.440
still like the, the state trumps I'm out. Like I, the fact that I don't like to say that trumps the

26:41.440 --> 26:47.520
fact that it's got good weather. Does that make sense? Um, nonetheless, uh, I always look at

26:48.320 --> 26:54.720
states that have like moderate weather. So Florida, Florida, like it, you know, it's got pretty decent

26:54.720 --> 27:02.480
weather year round. Um, Arizona, pretty decent weather year round. Nevada, decent, moderate

27:02.480 --> 27:07.680
weather year round, right? Even parts of Utah. And I know this cause I have a house in St. George,

27:07.680 --> 27:15.200
Utah, which is very close to Vegas, very moderate weather, right? And it, it does get hot. I guess

27:15.200 --> 27:20.400
I might want to even tweak what I'm saying. Seasonality matters, but also like when it, like

27:21.760 --> 27:26.960
try to stay away from places that just dump snow is maybe a less elegant way of saying it, right?

27:26.960 --> 27:33.040
A less elegant way of saying it. Um, but like St. George, Utah, for example, it never snows. And so

27:33.120 --> 27:38.080
people are always pouring concrete. Tree service is happening year round. Does it slow down a bit?

27:38.080 --> 27:43.040
Yeah, but it doesn't stop. Okay. So it does actually matter. So Florida, Arizona, Nevada,

27:43.040 --> 27:48.160
et cetera. Now you guys can, I want to tell you guys this cause let's say you were listening to

27:48.160 --> 27:51.920
this right now and you're like, Oh my gosh, I have this website in this state, in this city,

27:51.920 --> 27:58.160
and I probably made a mistake because you can still get deals. It's okay. I've done it.

27:58.960 --> 28:03.360
What you have to do though, is if you go into North Dakota, heaven forbid you do concrete in

28:03.360 --> 28:07.360
North Dakota, you're going to have to realize in the winter, it's going to stop. And so you're

28:07.360 --> 28:11.760
going to have to sell that deal and you're going to have to set expectations up front that, Hey,

28:11.760 --> 28:17.120
just so you know, like the winter is going to shut off, but you're going to keep paying me

28:17.120 --> 28:20.640
because I'm not going to charge you as much during the hot months. Like you have to,

28:21.440 --> 28:25.360
again, this is something that we cover inside of our training with our scripts, but it's,

28:25.360 --> 28:29.600
you have to position it correctly. Okay. You have to position it very, very well. It is doable. I

28:29.600 --> 28:35.760
would just highly recommend you try to stay away from like extremely cold States. Okay. And the

28:35.760 --> 28:41.040
reason I say that is because like it's, it's just, it's tough. It's tough guys. I'm trying to make

28:41.040 --> 28:47.840
this as easy as possible myself. Okay. Okay. Number five. And this, this isn't, this one kind

28:47.840 --> 28:52.560
of goes hand in hand with, this is more of like a reminder. This kind of goes hand in hand with the

28:52.560 --> 28:59.920
first one, but it's just a kind of a rule to remember is bigger population usually means

28:59.920 --> 29:09.680
more competition. Bigger population usually means more competition, not always, but most often

29:10.320 --> 29:16.000
bigger competition. There's a reason why Dallas is almost always impossible to rank a website.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
And so there's a reason why Dallas is going to be one of the hardest places to get your website to

29:20.080 --> 29:25.280
number one, because it's Dallas, it's Fort Worth, it's Arlington, it's this big DFW area. And there's

29:25.280 --> 29:29.040
so many people there that businesses are like, Oh, if I could just be in this area, there's

29:29.040 --> 29:32.720
unlimited customers. And you're thinking that and they're thinking that and everybody's thinking

29:32.720 --> 29:39.520
that. So just remember as the rule, the bigger the population, usually not a hundred percent time,

29:39.520 --> 29:46.400
but most of the time there's more competition. Okay. So what I try to do is I try to find the,

29:46.880 --> 29:53.840
the cities with the least population that still have adequate search for the least population.

29:53.840 --> 29:59.120
And I've found some really small cities. I have a specific project in a city of 30,000 people.

29:59.120 --> 30:03.680
And this thing, it doesn't make me a ton of money. It makes me like, I think like six or seven

30:03.680 --> 30:07.280
hundred bucks a month, but guys, I don't even think I put a backlink on it. I think we just

30:07.280 --> 30:13.680
threw up a website. We rank number one, throw up a GMB, boom, done. And that thing just been

30:13.680 --> 30:18.480
churning out 600 bucks a month for two, three years. Okay. Has enough search volume to get me

30:18.480 --> 30:23.680
that six, seven hundred bucks a month, but it took almost no work. Literally I just built a website

30:23.680 --> 30:28.000
and it's up there. It's done. We're good. Okay. So the bigger the population, usually the more

30:28.000 --> 30:36.080
competition next. Okay. Another rule that I live by another law principle I live by is do not

30:36.080 --> 30:42.240
run away. Do not let me say, do not immediately run away when you see another lead gen site.

30:44.640 --> 30:49.360
Do not run away when you immediately see another lead gen site. Guys, in the beginning of my

30:50.000 --> 30:53.680
rank and rank career, I, as soon as I saw another lead gen site and you guys know what they look

30:53.680 --> 30:59.200
like, they had the quote form and they look kind of bad, kind of terrible. We have like, we're not

30:59.200 --> 31:03.600
designers. We're, we like money, right? We had terrible looking websites. That's why I always

31:03.600 --> 31:08.880
make fun of my websites on my, on my shorts and my posts and stuff. You know, when you see a lead

31:08.880 --> 31:14.160
gen site typically, right? It's a generic name, blah, blah, blah. I used to be somebody as soon

31:14.160 --> 31:19.440
as I saw a lead gen site, I was out. I was like, no, I'm not going to mess with it. And I was like,

31:19.440 --> 31:22.960
gosh dang it, I should have got here earlier. And sometimes I'd even like go down and I look at the

31:22.960 --> 31:27.680
who is I'm like, and I'd find that person in there in my group. And I was like, gosh dude, I hate.

31:27.680 --> 31:32.240
And I occasionally, I even tried to reach out and buy those, these websites, these people just

31:32.240 --> 31:39.200
never worked out. And I like, just turned me away. And then I had an experience and I was in my own

31:39.200 --> 31:44.320
backyard. I was in St. George, Utah. And I was looking at tree service, right? It was when I was

31:44.320 --> 31:54.560
scaling tree service in 2020. Sorry. Yeah. 2020. And I did the research and everything looked good.

31:54.560 --> 32:01.840
Wasn't super competitive, but I saw another lead gen site. Okay. So I clear as day, another lead

32:01.840 --> 32:06.960
gen site. And I was just this close to just like being like, I'm not going to do it. And then I was

32:06.960 --> 32:11.520
like, you know what, maybe I'll just reach out. And I found out who it was. Sure enough, they were in

32:11.520 --> 32:16.080
one of my other groups, following the same training and whatever. And I was pissed. And I was like,

32:16.080 --> 32:19.200
you know what, I'm just going to reach out because I know who it is. I found them on Facebook. I'm

32:19.200 --> 32:24.240
like, Hey, are you interested in selling your tree service site in St. George? Just so you know,

32:24.240 --> 32:31.120
I live here. And they couldn't have been more rude. Not only were they not interested in selling

32:31.120 --> 32:34.480
me the site, but they were not interested in even having a conversation. They were not even

32:34.480 --> 32:40.320
interested in being an acquaintance of mine. They just felt me like to be a threat. And honestly,

32:40.320 --> 32:46.800
what happened is that pissed me off so bad. It really, really pissed me off that they like treated

32:46.800 --> 32:50.880
me like that, that I did it in spite of that. I literally did it in spite. I was like, okay,

32:51.680 --> 32:57.360
game on, game on. They were like number two. I was like, I'm going to be number one. And out of spite

32:57.360 --> 33:02.640
for this person, I went ahead and went into the city and built a website,

33:03.840 --> 33:10.800
got a client and had one of my best clients. I signed this person in 2020 March. I still remember

33:10.800 --> 33:18.640
it was like mid-March, right in the middle of COVID on the hood of their truck in a gas station

33:18.640 --> 33:23.760
parking lot. I swear to you, this is a true story. We had talked on Zoom earlier and then she had to

33:23.760 --> 33:28.080
talk to her husband or vice versa. No, I met him at a coffee shop. She talked to me. I swear to

33:28.080 --> 33:32.960
you, we met at a gas station and we signed a physical contract for the first month in March

33:32.960 --> 33:37.120
2020. It was one of my best clients ever. And they stayed with me for a long time. They eventually

33:37.120 --> 33:42.800
went on to do their own stuff like a few months ago, but they kind of outgrew what I was doing.

33:42.800 --> 33:49.680
They wanted to just expand. But literally, I would have missed out on, I think I made, what was that,

33:49.680 --> 33:54.320
over $20,000 because I almost ran away. Okay. So what you guys have to remember

33:55.120 --> 33:59.360
is just because you see another lead gen site, don't assume that that website's getting leads.

34:00.240 --> 34:03.680
Number one. Okay. What I mean by that is like, just because you see another lead gen site,

34:03.680 --> 34:07.680
doesn't necessarily mean you should go into that city. It doesn't mean they are getting leads. So

34:07.680 --> 34:10.480
it doesn't mean that like, yeah, that's a guaranteed, you should go to that city. Number

34:10.480 --> 34:17.200
two, don't assume because you see a lead gen site that they have a client. In fact, most of the

34:17.200 --> 34:22.400
time I would be like, pretty much assume they don't have a client. And that was the case in

34:22.400 --> 34:28.720
St. George tree service. I actually called the website or I requested for a quote and nobody

34:28.720 --> 34:33.360
answered. And then I did it like two or three times, nobody got back to me. And that's why I

34:33.360 --> 34:38.480
was like, let me reach out to these people. Don't assume they have a client. Okay. What you guys,

34:38.480 --> 34:42.480
and some of you guys might be in other programs, look at our free Facebook group. We have 6,000

34:42.480 --> 34:48.160
members. Do you know that in over half of the people in that group, in our free Facebook group

34:48.160 --> 34:52.000
have already learned the skillset of building a website and getting leads. They're probably in

34:52.000 --> 34:56.320
one or most of them are probably in, most of you guys are probably in one to two other groups.

34:56.320 --> 34:59.280
And the problem is, is just because you could build a website, just because you can get leads,

34:59.280 --> 35:03.760
does that mean you're going to make money? Guys don't assume because someone has a ranking website

35:03.760 --> 35:09.520
that they are working with a client. Okay. And thirdly, do not assume that two people

35:09.520 --> 35:14.320
cannot have two different clients in the same city. Even if they do have a client,

35:15.120 --> 35:17.440
why can't you work with Bob and I work with Joe?

35:20.640 --> 35:25.760
You can, it doesn't matter. It's just another website. We get so scared. We think that,

35:25.760 --> 35:30.640
who cares? What I do is if I see another lead generator, I just take that website and I view

35:30.640 --> 35:35.120
it just like any other website. I pretend it's Bob, the freaking concrete guy. And I look at

35:35.120 --> 35:38.880
his backlinks and I look at the age of his domain and I look at his content and I look

35:38.880 --> 35:43.200
how his website structured and I look at his GMB and I assess it just like it was Bob.

35:43.840 --> 35:50.240
That's it. And if it still works, if the numbers, if the competition is still low

35:50.240 --> 35:54.320
and the search volume is still there and everything else checks, dude, I'm going into it.

35:54.320 --> 35:58.800
I could care less or I couldn't care less. I think I couldn't care less how you say it.

35:58.800 --> 36:02.000
Okay. Don't immediately run away when you see another lead generator site.

36:02.000 --> 36:08.080
Okay. I got one more. Try to, this is my last one and I actually have a bonus one really quick.

36:08.960 --> 36:16.160
Try to find areas that are growing rapidly statistically. Try to find areas that are

36:16.160 --> 36:19.520
growing rapidly statistically or that are statistically growing rapidly. I don't know

36:19.520 --> 36:25.680
how the best way to say that English is. Okay. And I'm telling you this because if you know of

36:25.680 --> 36:32.000
areas that are growing rapidly, whether it's because of data you've seen, family members

36:32.000 --> 36:38.560
that live in those areas, you've traveled there for other jobs or vacation, knowing this information

36:38.560 --> 36:44.960
about cities will allow you to look at cities and confidently go into cities you never would have

36:44.960 --> 36:48.560
confidently gone into before. Even when everything else doesn't look so perfect.

36:48.560 --> 36:51.360
Okay. Let me give you two examples. Number one example is Bentonville, Arkansas.

36:52.640 --> 36:58.800
I lived in Bentonville, Arkansas, selling door to door home security systems. I saw how many houses

36:58.800 --> 37:04.640
were being built. I saw the construction companies. I saw how many families were moving into

37:04.640 --> 37:08.160
Bentonville, Arkansas. And I knew that the reason they were moving into Bentonville, Arkansas

37:08.160 --> 37:13.120
is because Walmart was headquartered there. And Walmart had a policy that if you want to sell to

37:13.120 --> 37:20.240
Walmart, you needed to have a office in Bentonville, Arkansas. Who knows about where? Bentonville,

37:20.240 --> 37:24.880
Arkansas, you need to have an office there. They're that big. They can demand an office.

37:24.880 --> 37:29.440
And so I was like, okay, Walmart's not going anywhere. And the guy that works for Jack

37:29.440 --> 37:34.240
links lives over there. And the guy that works for Pepsi lives over there. And the guy that

37:34.240 --> 37:38.800
does this. And I was like, this place is just going to keep growing. And I statistically

37:38.800 --> 37:43.920
was looking at some of the data with how it grew. And I was asking people, what was the recession

37:43.920 --> 37:48.400
like? They're like, dude, we didn't even feel it. And I saw just new construction after new

37:48.400 --> 37:53.600
construction. And I knew, because I spent time there, this place was going to explode and continue

37:53.600 --> 37:58.880
to grow. And it's continued to explode. Okay. And when I did the research on this area,

37:58.880 --> 38:04.080
the numbers weren't perfect. They weren't so good that I was just thrilled. I might have even

38:04.080 --> 38:07.360
skipped it. First of all, I wouldn't have even looked at it. Second of all, I probably would have

38:07.360 --> 38:13.760
skipped it if I hadn't have lived there or known about it. And, but because I knew about it, guys,

38:13.760 --> 38:16.800
I went in and build a website. You guys know, I've talked about some of that Bentonville

38:16.800 --> 38:22.640
concrete.com. And that site has made me so much money. It was so easy to rank. It was like the

38:22.640 --> 38:29.120
most perfect golden website ever. But one of the biggest reasons, because I had information,

38:29.680 --> 38:34.080
this was actually like first-hand information, that this city was rapidly growing. Okay. Another

38:34.080 --> 38:38.960
example of St. George, Utah, ironically, where I live, I, it's the same type of thing that the

38:38.960 --> 38:45.040
city is just exploding. The population when I built St. George tree service was not that great.

38:45.840 --> 38:50.160
And I was like, no, man. In fact, I avoided my own city for a long time, because I was like,

38:50.160 --> 38:54.320
everybody's cheap and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I don't want to sell the people that I know.

38:54.320 --> 38:58.400
And I was like, you're being an idiot, Nick. And in 2020, I built like three, four websites

38:58.400 --> 39:02.400
that made me over a thousand dollars a month each in my own backyard. And at one point,

39:02.400 --> 39:09.600
I think we were doing like close to $10,000 a month in my own backyard from niches in my own

39:09.600 --> 39:14.400
backyard, but that I'd completely skipped. But I finally was like, dude, look at all the growth,

39:14.400 --> 39:17.920
look at all the houses, look at all the construction companies, look at wherever all that.

39:17.920 --> 39:22.560
And it just was like, duh, you're such an idiot, Nick. Okay. Try to find areas that are rapidly

39:22.560 --> 39:26.720
growing. Okay. And if you can get statistics, great. If you know first-hand information from

39:26.720 --> 39:30.800
family members, friends traveling there, or you've been there yourself, even better. Okay.

39:31.520 --> 39:37.520
My bonus tip, my bonus rule. Okay. And this is something that like doesn't have to be checked,

39:37.520 --> 39:43.760
but it's, it helps a lot. That's why I want to give it to you guys is knowing the demographic

39:43.760 --> 39:47.520
and the area. Okay. Which kind of goes hand in hand a little bit with what I just said,

39:47.520 --> 39:53.520
but if you guys can know a little bit about the people that live there, right? A little bit about

39:53.520 --> 39:57.600
the people. I'm a, I'm a big believer that humans are humans are humans. Meaning that like, if I,

39:58.320 --> 40:07.040
you know, like, for example, humans, what's a good example? Like for, like if I'm somebody in Utah

40:07.760 --> 40:14.320
that likes groceries delivered to my house, it's pretty likely that you living in Connecticut,

40:14.320 --> 40:17.520
you also like groceries delivered to your house because you don't want to go to the grocery store

40:17.520 --> 40:22.320
and waste your time and potentially get, you know, sick or whatever the case is, right?

40:22.320 --> 40:28.560
Humans are humans are humans. However, I have learned that from state to state, city to city,

40:29.360 --> 40:35.760
definitely country to country, there are nuances. And the more you know, the better decisions you're

40:35.760 --> 40:42.080
going to make. And let me give you an example. In bed in Northwest Arkansas, there's a city called

40:42.080 --> 40:48.400
Bentonville. I just talked about an hour and a half, maybe two hours south. There's a city called

40:48.400 --> 40:57.120
Fort Smith. Okay. Just, I think about two hours. I've been there a few times. And I will tell you

40:57.120 --> 41:04.800
that the, the difference in the people is so, is so different. It is, they're still from Arkansas.

41:04.800 --> 41:10.080
They're still a Southern ish. I'd call them more Midwestern, but technically we say Arkansas

41:10.080 --> 41:15.760
Southern. But guys, for some reason, people that live in Fort Smith have this old school mentality.

41:15.760 --> 41:20.800
It's good old boy. We only do business with people that we know. And when we want to do business,

41:20.800 --> 41:24.720
we ask for referrals and that's it. And we don't want anyone new in our town. And if you come into

41:24.720 --> 41:28.880
my town, I'm not that interested in talking to you. That's how the mentality is. It's two hours away

41:28.880 --> 41:33.840
from Bentonville. And guess what? In Bentonville, no one's from Bentonville. No one, everyone's from

41:33.840 --> 41:39.360
somewhere else. And they're, they've been implanted because of work. Another example,

41:40.000 --> 41:45.360
St. George, Utah, where I live. Okay. Tons of people moving in, but in my cul-de-sac,

41:45.360 --> 41:50.240
where I have a house, my next door neighbors from Northern Utah. So they're from same state,

41:50.240 --> 41:54.400
but like four hours away. Then the other two people in my cul-de-sac, one from Texas,

41:54.400 --> 42:01.280
one from California. Okay. Like everyone's from not there. Like, and I'm not from that city either.

42:01.280 --> 42:05.360
I'm from Utah, but I'm not from that city. Everyone's moved there for work opportunities,

42:05.360 --> 42:10.640
for the weather, for recreation, whatever. And because I knew that I'm like, okay, confidently,

42:10.640 --> 42:16.960
I know that if people are from California or people are from Texas, you know, they're probably

42:16.960 --> 42:20.320
going to be more likely to spend money. One thing I know about people from Utah, because I've lived

42:20.320 --> 42:26.960
there, is that in small towns in Utah, people are very cheap. People would say, do anything to save

42:26.960 --> 42:32.000
$5. I swear to you, they would drive across town, not thinking they're going to spend $15 in gas

42:32.480 --> 42:36.880
to go to get a $5 coupon redeemed. And I swear to you, I'm not making that up. If any of you guys

42:36.880 --> 42:41.760
on the stream that are from Utah, you guys can verify what I'm saying. So I knew that the city

42:41.760 --> 42:46.480
that I lived in, St. George, wasn't really Utah people. It was mainly like people from out of state.

42:47.760 --> 42:52.000
45 minutes up the road, there's a little city called Cedar City, Utah, which I went to college

42:52.000 --> 42:56.880
in for two years. And that place is basically only people from Cedar City. And guess what?

42:56.880 --> 43:04.720
No one wants to spend money. You want to charge what to pour my concrete? Nah, dude, I'll just go

43:04.720 --> 43:11.840
get the bags at whatever and get people from my church to come help me. You want to pay for moving?

43:11.840 --> 43:15.920
I'm not paying for moving services. I'm certainly not going to have you pressure wash my driveway.

43:15.920 --> 43:20.400
I'll just go buy a pressure washer. I'll do it myself. Like, this is the mentality of these

43:20.400 --> 43:25.680
people that are 45 minutes away from the city of St. George in a city called Cedar City.

43:26.320 --> 43:31.200
It's insane. And so the hard part is, if you don't live in those areas, you don't know that.

43:31.760 --> 43:37.280
But when you know that, it changes the entire game. So you have to remember, the more information you

43:37.280 --> 43:41.120
can get on these cities, the more information you can get when you call business owners. Because when

43:41.120 --> 43:47.120
you're calling business owners, Nick notes, how did that one act? Oh, that one acted like he didn't

43:47.120 --> 43:51.040
even want to talk to me, like I had a disease. And then the next three were the same. Okay,

43:51.040 --> 43:56.800
maybe there's something there. Right. So guys, just remember that knowing the area and the

43:56.800 --> 44:02.000
demographic people does matter. Okay. So let me give this quick recap on these different laws

44:02.000 --> 44:06.160
of picking the perfect city. And then I'm going to go into Q&A. So number one is population does

44:06.160 --> 44:09.840
not matter. Number two is if you could see it on a map, then it's probably not going to be worth

44:09.840 --> 44:17.280
your time. Number three, certain states suck, namely California and New Jersey. Number four,

44:17.280 --> 44:22.000
weather and seasonality do matter. Stay out of places that are extremely cold if you can.

44:22.960 --> 44:29.040
Number five, bigger population usually equals bigger competition. Number six, don't immediately

44:29.040 --> 44:34.560
run away when you see another Legion site. Number seven, try to find areas that are growing

44:34.560 --> 44:38.880
rapidly. And then my bonus tip is the more you know about the area, the more you know about the

44:38.880 --> 44:45.200
demographics, the better decisions you're going to make. Guys, these are things that I have learned

44:45.280 --> 44:48.400
because I have literally looked at a thousand locations. I've gone into

44:49.360 --> 44:56.160
hundreds of the wrong cities, hundreds. And I mean that like we had well over 200 websites at one

44:56.160 --> 45:02.640
point in inside of my business, in all different cities, in all different niches. And we made our

45:02.640 --> 45:09.920
million dollars off of like 40 websites. Yeah. So you guys have to realize that like all these

45:09.920 --> 45:13.360
people that are giving you advice, build, build, build, build, build, build, build, build, build,

45:13.840 --> 45:19.120
most these guys are selling you tools to build. Most of you guys, most of those guys are making

45:19.120 --> 45:23.760
money because you are building more websites, right? I'm not selling you tracking numbers.

45:23.760 --> 45:27.840
I'm not selling you websites. I'm not selling you hosting. I'm not selling you that stuff.

45:28.960 --> 45:33.120
I don't. And that's not how I roll. I want to build a website that's going to work. I want to go.

45:33.120 --> 45:37.680
I want to run ads. I want to get the deal. And I want to be a sniper. I don't want to take a

45:37.680 --> 45:43.600
shotgun and just shoot bullets. That's messy, right? It's just some heavy cleanup. I want to

45:43.600 --> 45:49.200
be a sniper. And if I decide to go into that city, it's one shot, one kill. I know what's

45:49.200 --> 45:52.480
going to happen. I'm most likely going to get that deal. I know I'm going to get that deal.

45:52.480 --> 45:56.000
I'm going to build a website and I'm going to have a really clean business. I'm not just throwing

45:56.000 --> 46:01.040
stuff at the wall, hoping to see what sticks. Okay. So that said, guys, who has questions?

46:01.040 --> 46:04.160
Let me see if there's anything in the comments. We got some stuff in the chat.

46:04.880 --> 46:09.920
Here we go. So just for the sake of time, I'm going to go ahead and just read through these

46:09.920 --> 46:12.400
in the future. I'll try to leave more time. We can have you guys come on live. So

46:14.000 --> 46:21.040
Jay says he's in Jersey. Jay, prove me wrong, but I promise you Jersey. I don't know what it is,

46:21.040 --> 46:26.720
man. It's a weird state. Okay. Kirk says, I'm not sure what you mean by relative to competition.

46:26.720 --> 46:29.600
Can you give an example? So what I mean by that is like,

46:30.560 --> 46:34.960
so let me read your entire comment to make sure I know exactly. I'm not sure what you mean by

46:34.960 --> 46:39.840
relative to competition. Can you give an example? E.g. volume 50, then what would too much competition

46:39.840 --> 46:44.880
look like for that volume and location? So that, again, as I said in the beginning,

46:44.880 --> 46:48.960
we're not going to be able to cover all of that in this 40 minutes. That's part of what we talk

46:48.960 --> 46:54.400
about, our formula for picking a perfect city in terms of competition. We're just talking about

46:55.360 --> 47:01.600
about like my rules of picking the perfect city. But what I mean by that is like, you want to get

47:01.600 --> 47:09.040
into a city. What matters is having enough search volume while still having low competition. And

47:09.040 --> 47:14.320
what I mean by low competition, guys, is the ability to rank your website. Right? If you look

47:14.320 --> 47:18.320
at Las Vegas, Nevada, tree service, there's probably going to be a ton of search volume,

47:18.960 --> 47:23.840
but it's also going to be a lot of competition. Okay. If you look at Las Vegas, Nevada,

47:23.840 --> 47:26.320
tree service is going to be a lot of search volume. There's going to be a lot of competition.

47:28.560 --> 47:32.560
Right. We want to go into cities that have good search volume. They're probably not going to be

47:32.560 --> 47:37.760
as high as Vegas, but there's almost no competition. That's the sweet spot. Right.

47:37.760 --> 47:43.680
That's what I call a layup. Hopefully that makes sense. And again, to answer that specific question,

47:43.680 --> 47:47.440
the like the volume and all that stuff, that's something that we that's like, it's a much

47:47.440 --> 47:52.640
heavier question that we cover in more depth in inside of our thing. But Mark,

47:54.000 --> 47:59.440
what's your take on a town of 40,000 with search volumes of 10? So the tricky part of the search

47:59.440 --> 48:05.360
volume thing, we're going back to like also what Kirk said, is it depends on the tool you're using.

48:05.360 --> 48:10.400
Right. Because I don't know what tool you're using and you what, basically I'll give you like the

48:10.400 --> 48:15.600
overview with, with tools, they're all wrong. Like nothing's accurate period, just so you know,

48:15.600 --> 48:19.520
like nothing's accurate. All you're doing with tools is you're finding benchmarks. You're finding

48:19.520 --> 48:26.080
out like how, okay. You know, Bentonville, Arkansas, concrete, I'm ranking number one

48:26.080 --> 48:30.880
for all these keywords and I get 30 leads per month for the last two years. Okay. Boom. So

48:31.760 --> 48:36.640
how much, what does that tool say about Bentonville concrete? Well, it says that there's only

48:36.640 --> 48:42.400
50, sorry, it says there's 15 searches. Well, that's not true because I'm getting 30 leads.

48:42.400 --> 48:47.600
Right. So then I can safely assume that if the tool says 15, it's probably double. Right. So you

48:47.600 --> 48:51.840
kind of have to find a benchmark and go off that. So I can't answer that question based on that data,

48:51.840 --> 48:57.840
but what I would tell you is like 40,000 is on the lower end and 10, no matter what tool you're

48:57.840 --> 49:02.960
using seems low. The other thing you have to consider, which I probably would add, I would

49:02.960 --> 49:07.760
definitely add into this, but I don't, I don't want to get too much into weeds because that's stuff

49:07.760 --> 49:12.800
that I cover when you have to have the full picture is you need to know what the CPC is

49:13.760 --> 49:17.280
because if it's, if it's a search volume of 10 and there's zero cost per click,

49:18.240 --> 49:20.640
then that probably means no one even wants that traffic.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.640
And I don't know if that makes any sense to you, but I can go into that in more depth, but yeah,

49:24.640 --> 49:28.320
that's going to be too hard to answer. I would say just my gut tells me that's not enough

49:28.320 --> 49:34.480
volume. You got to have adequate search volume. Guy Prantz, same thing. You guys are asking really

49:34.480 --> 49:38.800
good questions. This is one of those things like, again, that it's tough to answer unless

49:38.800 --> 49:44.160
you know exactly the entire process. So adequate search volume basically means taking a website

49:44.160 --> 49:48.800
that you know for a fact is ranking really well, looking at the numbers of that in terms of how

49:48.800 --> 49:54.080
many calls it's getting, comparing that with the tool you're using and using that as a benchmark.

49:55.120 --> 49:58.640
And you have to do that repeatedly. You have to do that because the tools change, the search volume

49:58.640 --> 50:02.800
changes, and you kind of constantly have to be doing that. And so, and at the end of the day,

50:02.800 --> 50:09.120
it's not entirely a science. It's more of an art. And by doing this a thousand times,

50:09.120 --> 50:13.760
you kind of recognize these patterns. Okay. Laura says definitely done that.

50:14.800 --> 50:18.560
Kirk, how do I benchmark a niche location when I don't have a site there? You guys can use,

50:19.200 --> 50:26.720
if you want to ask this question, Kirk, inside of the free group, you can ask this question.

50:26.720 --> 50:32.880
Like you go make a post, and then Aaron, I'll have you remind me to look at the data on,

50:32.880 --> 50:37.040
we could say Bentonville concrete, and I can kind of give you a city that's ranking really well,

50:37.040 --> 50:43.200
and you could use that to benchmark if you guys want. Okay. Howard says, does median income

50:43.200 --> 50:47.360
matter? If so, what's the average income threshold you're aiming for? I think it's a factor. To be

50:47.360 --> 50:53.280
honest, I've never really looked at it. I just know like certain states are like usually not

50:53.280 --> 51:00.000
as well to do. Like I know Mississippi is a very poor state, just statistically. And so I've,

51:00.000 --> 51:03.760
in fact, I've only done one website in, I think, was it, no, that's in Louisiana.

51:04.880 --> 51:08.480
Maybe I haven't done anything in Mississippi. I just kind of stay out of states that are like,

51:08.480 --> 51:15.920
it sounds bad, but like, I don't have to go into Mississippi. I can be that way. I don't have to

51:15.920 --> 51:20.400
go in there. I can, whatever. So it does matter. I've never really like looked at it too much. I

51:20.400 --> 51:27.840
think it's more about just like, I don't think you need to worry that much about it, but as a

51:27.840 --> 51:31.920
state, if it has like kind of a stigma as being a poor state, I probably would avoid it. Okay.

51:32.960 --> 51:37.440
Jay says, so should I just start in Bentonville? You can. You definitely can. And guys,

51:37.440 --> 51:43.200
funny thing is I'm so not the person that gives a flying you know what about like,

51:43.200 --> 51:46.960
guys, I'm telling you guys which cities I'm in. I'm not hiding anything. I'm telling you the

51:46.960 --> 51:52.480
niches. I know I'm telling you the web. Like I have videos on, on YouTube. You guys could see

51:52.480 --> 51:56.160
website examples. And the reason I do that is because if I'm taking care of my client,

51:56.160 --> 52:00.080
I shouldn't have to worry, right? It's like being married to someone and being worried that like,

52:00.080 --> 52:04.480
if you introduce them to your handsome friend, she's going to leave you. That's the wrong person to

52:04.480 --> 52:09.120
be married to, or you're not, you're not bringing, you're not pulling your weight. So I don't worry

52:09.120 --> 52:13.200
about that stuff. So I'm, yeah. So basically, Jay, if you want to go to Bentonville, dude, check it

52:13.200 --> 52:17.040
out. It's a great city. St. George, Utah is a great city. Queen Creek, Arizona. I'll share that

52:17.040 --> 52:21.040
with you. These are great cities. They're growing. You can also do a Google search and type in like

52:21.040 --> 52:26.400
fastest growing cities for the last five years in the U.S. and get the same thing. So, you know,

52:26.400 --> 52:28.560
but keep in mind if it's Bentonville, I probably looked at it as well.

52:30.080 --> 52:33.040
Jason, you're 100% New Jersey is highly competitive and saturated. Very difficult.

52:33.040 --> 52:39.440
Interesting. Beautiful. Guys, thank you for being on. I appreciate you guys being on. I love this.

52:39.440 --> 52:42.640
I don't know even how many we ended up having on, but let me see. We got Paul,

52:43.360 --> 52:50.000
Mark, Ferranc, Lara. What I want to do, Aaron, can you hear me still? Hop on really quick before

52:50.000 --> 52:56.640
you guys hop off. So what we're going to do guys is Aaron's going to, he's been on this call. He's

52:56.640 --> 53:02.560
going to create just like a simple, like PDF with these rules, like a really like nice looking clean

53:02.560 --> 53:09.440
PDF. And anyone that was on this live, I'm trying to think how we could, what you're going to do,

53:09.440 --> 53:13.760
Aaron, can you like screenshot everyone that was on this live somehow? And I want you to

53:13.760 --> 53:17.760
send this to them. So if you guys were on this, just because I appreciate you guys staying on

53:17.760 --> 53:23.440
to the end, if you're on here right now, then Aaron will DM you from the Donnie Dre. We tried

53:23.440 --> 53:27.600
to do that so Aaron doesn't have to be inundated with messages on his private one. He's going to

53:28.240 --> 53:34.640
email you like a nice looking like document with all the stuff I went over today. So if you guys

53:34.640 --> 53:40.480
were on there, stay on. Did you screenshot it yet, Aaron? Yeah, you're good. Okay. Last question

53:40.480 --> 53:45.600
I'll answer really quick is, is the search volume good enough if the Google ad forecast shows 84

53:45.600 --> 53:51.280
clicks with a budget of $20 a day? I don't look at that metric and I never have, so I couldn't. I

53:51.280 --> 53:58.560
look at the search volume versus the CPC versus the competition. And again, the competition thing

53:58.560 --> 54:04.720
is kind of one of those formulas that we teach, that I teach inside of my program, but I could

54:04.720 --> 54:09.280
cover it in more detail. Again, I want to give you guys as much as possible. It's kind of like

54:09.280 --> 54:13.120
the free leads thing. Like I want to give you guys, I want you guys to be able to take what you

54:13.120 --> 54:16.160
learned today and be able to get started, right? Just like we don't want to give our business

54:16.160 --> 54:20.560
owners leads and, well, here's some leads, but I hope you don't make money, right? That's stupid.

54:20.560 --> 54:24.000
I want you guys to take this. If you guys make money from what I teach you today,

54:24.000 --> 54:30.320
you'll be back next time. So amazing questions, guys. Appreciate you guys being on and we'll be

54:30.320 --> 54:34.160
doing these every single week. So keep an eye on the Facebook group and we've got some other stuff

54:34.160 --> 54:37.200
coming up this week as well. So thanks guys. I'm out.
