1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
So what I call it means like, Hey, so actually right now, um, I'm grocery shopping with my family.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,600
So we'll do this a little bit later. Okay. I'm like, okay, that's fine. Cool. Hour and a half later,

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,600
I call them and nothing. I call them again, like 30 minutes later, nothing and nothing. So,

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,080
so at that point, do I just move on to the next person? No. So here's what you need to do. Um,

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,040
that's kind of like, cause you kind of got that scent sounds like when you were talking to him,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,520
right? And you kind of tell this kind of a yes, man, he's getting, he's nice, sick. He probably

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,680
wouldn't do something to offend you. Kind of a guy like really soft spoken. If I get a guy

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,760
like that, because you could bulldog the shit out of those guys, but at the end of the day,

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,600
they're not going to give you their credit card. So what I do is I I'm like, Hey, can I,

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,960
I can call you back later. I got a job. It's hot. They need a tree removal. I can call you back,

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,760
but I also don't want to waste my time or your time. If I call you back, are you going to pick

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,560
up or is this just the, this is the no, like it's a soft no. I'll, I'll literally say that because

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,000
if not, that guy might not even be following you. And now you're going to be like, Oh, I got somebody,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,880
I got somebody. And you're going to be thinking, Oh, we're good, but you're not. So I would ask

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,360
right there and then get your answer. And a lot of times that pullback, they're like, Oh, okay,

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,760
this is different. This guy is actually like a real person, not a robot. And, and you'll get them

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,520
to answer right there. So that's what I would have done different. I would still keep hitting them.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,560
Maybe like if the lead comes in, do a screenshot, blur out the number. Hey, I got this lead. I want

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,360
to send it to you. Can you give me a call? Um, but I, I wouldn't chase them too much. I would just

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,400
do, I'd be try some different angles.
