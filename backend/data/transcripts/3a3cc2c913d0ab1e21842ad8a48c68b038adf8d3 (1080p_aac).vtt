Guys, really quick as we wrap up this module on content, I want to talk about outsourcing

00:10.040 --> 00:11.040
really quick.

00:11.040 --> 00:15.360
And a lot of you guys, I know it's like, oh my gosh, content, it's the worst, it sucks.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.240
Back to what I said.

00:17.240 --> 00:21.280
This is one of those areas, if we can get good at it, if we can master it, this is going

00:21.280 --> 00:23.080
to give us that edge over the competition.

00:23.080 --> 00:28.780
So again, change your mindset from this is a burden to how do I master it, how do I get

00:28.780 --> 00:29.780
good at it.

00:29.780 --> 00:33.500
And that segues perfectly into when should you outsource your content.

00:33.500 --> 00:38.140
It's the same answer as when you should outsource anything after you master it.

00:38.140 --> 00:42.220
If you do not know how to write content yourself, how are you going to outsource it?

00:42.220 --> 00:46.620
How are you going to know that the person that you gave it to wrote good content?

00:46.620 --> 00:48.500
How are you going to know that they didn't plagiarize it?

00:48.500 --> 00:50.620
How are you going to know that it's decent content?

00:50.620 --> 00:53.140
You're not unless you personally know how to write it and you're not going to be able

00:53.140 --> 00:54.140
to know how to train on it.

00:54.740 --> 01:00.740
Number one, don't start or try to outsource something until you first have mastered it.

01:00.740 --> 01:04.860
We are going to be coming out with some resources if you decide that you want to start outsourcing

01:04.860 --> 01:11.220
content in the future, but for now go master it and let's go rank these websites.
