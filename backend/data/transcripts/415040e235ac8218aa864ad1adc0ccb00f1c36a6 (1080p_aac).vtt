00:00.000 --> 00:13.800
Guys, let's put this all together. Let's do this from start to finish. And what I want

00:13.800 --> 00:19.800
you to do, I want you to hop over to the perfect prospecting script. And I'm going to pull

00:19.800 --> 00:23.640
it up on my screen right now. Guys, this is the perfect prospecting script. And at the

00:23.640 --> 00:26.720
top, I'm just going to go through this really, really briefly so we can put this all together.

00:26.840 --> 00:33.320
At the top, I've kind of just put this as a way to just mentally see how this works.

00:33.320 --> 00:38.440
So the way that this was explained to me when I first got into sales, when they were teaching

00:38.440 --> 00:43.600
me like, okay, here's the steps to a perfect approach. Here's the steps to a perfect door

00:43.600 --> 00:50.760
approach or a perfect cold call. They described it, the managers, and I had really, really good

00:50.760 --> 00:55.840
trainers, people that really knew their stuff. So I love sharing this stuff, but it's the sizzle

00:55.840 --> 01:01.120
and the steak. So the sizzle is you call them, you grab their attention, you break the ice.

01:01.120 --> 01:08.880
The steak is, hey, here's the step. Here's exactly what I'm doing, why I'm calling, the deal,

01:08.880 --> 01:14.160
and the transition. The sizzle is grabbing their attention. So just maybe as more of a visual,

01:14.160 --> 01:17.360
think of it as a sizzle and a steak, just like you would when you're grilling a steak. So you

01:17.360 --> 01:21.440
got that sizzle to grab their attention. Then you got the actual, the thick of it, the steak.

01:21.440 --> 01:25.600
And that's the way that I think about it. So I just listed here, the sizzle is to grab the

01:25.600 --> 01:30.000
attention, break the ice, get them to ask in their head, what the hell is this guy doing?

01:30.000 --> 01:34.400
You're getting their attention. And then the steak is the steps. Who you are, what you're doing,

01:34.400 --> 01:37.920
what's in it for them, what's in it for you, and transition. This is one step combined,

01:37.920 --> 01:44.320
that's the deal, but I just separated it out. So guys, the funny thing is, or not the funny thing,

01:44.320 --> 01:50.720
but the ironic part is, this doesn't look like much. This has every step that we just covered.

01:51.280 --> 01:57.440
The who you are, the what you're doing, the deal, and the transition all built in. So

01:58.080 --> 02:03.680
if you guys choose, and you need to, for these first couple calls, guys, read this verbatim.

02:03.680 --> 02:08.960
It doesn't matter. It does not matter. And if you read this verbatim, you actually will get

02:08.960 --> 02:14.560
people on the hook. No shit. You will get people on the hook. That's how good this is. It is deadly.

02:14.560 --> 02:19.280
Now, once you master it and you can just start speaking like a normal human, plus say these

02:19.280 --> 02:24.240
things, you're going to be dangerous. Let's just go through this. So again, as we talked about,

02:24.240 --> 02:31.360
first thing you're going to do is, hey, Jack, this is Nick. Do you guys do ex service? Do you

02:31.360 --> 02:35.840
guys do patios? And again, this is going to be a slight variation of what we talked about,

02:35.840 --> 02:40.880
the same exact concept. Do you guys do patios? Cool. Or do you guys do patios here in Little Valley?

02:41.920 --> 02:47.520
You can combine it. Great. And then they're going to respond. Okay, great. And do you cover

02:47.520 --> 02:53.120
this area, which we talked about? So, hey, do you guys cover Little Valley? Do you guys cover

02:53.120 --> 02:59.360
Henderson? Do you guys cover Summerlin? Do you guys cover Norcross? A suburb of whatever, wherever

02:59.360 --> 03:06.000
that lead is at. Do you guys cover 84790? And they're going to respond. Cool or excellent.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.960
Last, lastly, how far out are you guys? You can even make a joke. Can you guys actually do

03:10.960 --> 03:16.800
something in 2022 or in 2023? Are we looking at like in a decade? I mean, this is getting crazy.

03:17.680 --> 03:21.360
Oh yeah, yeah. No, we're a couple of months out, but we can get, we can take care of you. Okay,

03:21.360 --> 03:26.720
cool. Okay. And so then, and you'll notice here, like I make, this is a little bit different than

03:26.720 --> 03:31.760
what I explained, but it covers the exact same thing. And so I'm not actually going to reshoot

03:31.760 --> 03:36.400
this. Okay. Because I want to prove a point here. It's about hitting the steps, not about having it

03:36.400 --> 03:40.880
in the perfect order. It's about hitting the main point. So in this script, this is the script I've

03:40.880 --> 03:46.800
been using forever. This is how I have it listed. Ironically, as I was teaching and training the

03:46.800 --> 03:50.560
last few times I've done it, I put this at the end and I want to keep it this way because I want

03:50.560 --> 03:54.560
to show you that it doesn't matter. You just need to hit the point. So in this script, it says we,

03:54.560 --> 04:01.680
we, we can say, Hey, I've got this lady. I got Janet here. Janet here in Little Valley. She needs

04:01.680 --> 04:07.040
tree service or she needs a tree removal. And I just wanted to make sure you could help them before

04:07.040 --> 04:11.680
I wasted any of your time. Guys in the, in the last couple of videos, I mentioned this at the end.

04:11.680 --> 04:17.280
It doesn't matter. Okay. This is just how the script is right now. Okay. And feel free to make

04:17.280 --> 04:22.960
some tweaks to this. It fit this, fit this to your style, but realize it's just about hitting the

04:22.960 --> 04:28.560
points. I just want to go over that. Okay. And then I put to which you will continue. And guys, I,

04:28.560 --> 04:32.320
I left out what the business owner is going to say in return, but you can kind of just interpret

04:32.320 --> 04:36.160
the business owner is going to say, you know, who the hell are you? What, whatever, right? Who's this

04:36.160 --> 04:40.880
guy? Like, what are you doing? Et cetera. Oh, sorry. Like I said, my name's Nick and I have a

04:40.880 --> 04:47.200
website and phone number here in blank city in St. George. That's getting a ton of, or getting three

04:47.200 --> 04:54.160
to five concrete jobs every week. Notice how I said jobs, not leads. Very important to, to notice.

04:54.160 --> 04:59.760
Okay. And then I put here I, and guys, again, you could read this verbatim. It will work. Okay.

04:59.760 --> 05:04.000
I was planning on sending you a couple for free before I take any of your time,

05:04.000 --> 05:11.120
but to be candid with you, I am looking to find a partner here in Austin to work on an ongoing basis

05:11.120 --> 05:16.640
or just here in Austin. Okay. Doesn't need to be perfect. Okay. I want you guys to see that this

05:16.640 --> 05:21.440
doesn't need to be perfect. Okay. Continuing. I noticed, and again, you can probably just guess,

05:21.440 --> 05:27.280
Hey, I transition right there. I noticed you're already paying for Google ads. So I know you're

05:27.280 --> 05:32.960
hungry to take on more work and figured since I already, since I already have to work, why not

05:32.960 --> 05:36.880
just work with you directly? Guys, it's just a different order of what we already talked about.

05:36.880 --> 05:42.400
Okay. Again, so, and then you can imagine the business was going to respond. So let me send

05:42.400 --> 05:48.400
you this lady. Let me send you Janet real quick, maybe one or two more. And then all I ask in return

05:48.400 --> 05:53.920
is a conversation in a couple of days. How does that sound? Is that cool? Same thing, right? Just

05:53.920 --> 05:59.360
in a little bit different order. Okay. You open to that and then literally I put in here, that's it.

05:59.360 --> 06:04.000
I'm going to bold this actually on, on, I'm going to bold this. That's it. That's all you need to say.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.960
Okay. And I even said right here, that's it. Do not discuss, in fact, I'm going to put asterisks

06:08.960 --> 06:14.000
by this. Do not discuss price. Do not tell them you were looking to do a flat fee contract, blah,

06:14.000 --> 06:19.040
blah, blah. You will lose the deal. We talked about this at the beginning when I said, do not,

06:19.040 --> 06:23.280
you're selling dinner. You're not selling marriage. Okay. If they ask repeatedly,

06:23.280 --> 06:28.320
and this is one thing I want to point out. Okay. And one thing too, I want to just add into this is

06:28.320 --> 06:43.280
we need to add transition. Okay. Let me grab. What's the best email and phone number to send leads to

06:46.480 --> 06:56.640
explain. By the way, I'm doing this real time. So you let's, I don't even, I hope this isn't

06:56.640 --> 07:01.680
even getting edited out. I want to keep this in. Okay. Explain the live transfer

07:03.680 --> 07:09.840
and then pull back if necessary. Okay. There's a couple of things I want to add. Okay. Last

07:09.840 --> 07:13.360
thing I want to mention on this, cause guys, that's it. There's nothing else to talk about.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.720
If you need to read the damn script, read the damn script, this will work. This is like,

07:16.720 --> 07:20.240
this is why I call it the perfect prospecting trip. Read this shit word for word. It'll work.

07:20.880 --> 07:27.040
Read it word for word. It will work if you need to master it, learn it, put it in your brain,

07:27.040 --> 07:30.640
and then say it as you would say it. And you're going to be a deadly human being. You're going

07:30.640 --> 07:34.880
to be a savage salesperson. Okay. You're going to be hooking people freaking left and right. Like

07:34.880 --> 07:39.840
you're using some illegal substance. Like they do out on the, on the lakes where you use corn,

07:39.840 --> 07:45.280
or where you use like WD or DW, whatever that stuff 40, where you spray it on totally illegal,

07:45.280 --> 07:49.440
but it works like a charm. That's going to be you. Okay. Last point is this. Okay.

07:51.680 --> 07:58.320
If they ask repeatedly about price, which they can and sometimes will, I mentioned here,

07:58.320 --> 08:02.320
and I said this at the beginning, just push it off till the end. Hey, look, I'm not actually

08:02.320 --> 08:07.920
worried about that. I do all kinds of different deals. Like honestly, that's the, that's the

08:07.920 --> 08:11.600
wrong question. We're putting the cart before the horse. Let me get you a couple of jobs

08:12.480 --> 08:16.480
before we even get to that. Okay. And if they keep going to like, Oh, just give me a ballpark.

08:16.480 --> 08:22.640
Here's my response. Okay. To be honest, I have, I have somebody right now that's paying me around

08:22.640 --> 08:27.600
three to $400 per month. And I also have a company that's paying me $50,000 per month. So it's going

08:27.600 --> 08:32.800
to be somewhere in there. No, but seriously, that's not that like we'll, we'll work something out.

08:32.800 --> 08:36.240
Don't worry about that. Okay. And we're just, we're just kind of, we're just saying, Hey, look,

08:36.240 --> 08:41.520
it's going to be, it's too hard to tell at this point. Stop asking that question. Okay. But if you

08:41.520 --> 08:45.920
need to satisfy them, cause they keep asking, I like to use that. And that's true. Hey, I got

08:45.920 --> 08:50.720
somebody paying three, $400 bucks and I got somebody paying me $50,000. I definitely can tell you

08:50.720 --> 08:54.560
you're going to be way closer to the bottom than the top, but we have a huge range. It depends on

08:54.560 --> 08:58.880
a couple of things, but I don't, I don't want to waste time on that until we can figure out if this

08:58.880 --> 09:04.080
is even a good fit. Okay. And back into it, back into the process, right? That's what's cool about

09:04.080 --> 09:09.680
having a process. You have your steps and your transition. And if you deviate and start asking

09:09.680 --> 09:14.320
questions outside of that, you can answer it and come right back to where you were at. If you, if

09:14.320 --> 09:20.560
they cut you off in the middle of explaining the deal, cool. Answer it. Come right back. Like I was

09:20.560 --> 09:25.440
saying, I want to give you a couple of free leads. Let's talk in a couple of days. Why don't I just

09:25.440 --> 09:30.000
give you the leads in exchange for, we work something out. I mean, I don't know about you,

09:30.000 --> 09:34.080
but unless you have some kind of a romantic relationship with Google or Larry Page or

09:34.080 --> 09:38.960
Sergey Brin, I don't like, I would love to work with someone local. And I'm sure you would too.

09:38.960 --> 09:46.240
Okay. Just address it. But the point is, and I mentioned this at the first, don't sell marriage,

09:46.800 --> 09:52.000
sell them. Okay. Guys, that's it. This is the script. This script has been working like a charm

09:52.000 --> 09:57.040
for me for years and years and years. And yeah, I had a couple of tweaks. You guys just saw me real

09:57.040 --> 10:02.240
time. Add a couple little tweaks. Okay. The important part is that we hit the steps necessary.

10:02.240 --> 10:07.520
And just to recap who you, first of all, the sizzle, okay. Pattern interrupt who you are,

10:08.160 --> 10:12.720
what you're doing, which is a damn good reason why you're calling. Okay. And I like to make sure

10:12.720 --> 10:16.480
that you remember that the deal, what's in it for them, what's in it for you, stressing more on

10:16.480 --> 10:22.800
what's in it for you and the transition and drop in a pullback when necessary. Guys, that's it.

10:22.800 --> 10:27.840
Hook these people. Let's get them some leads and let's get one step closer to closing the deal.
