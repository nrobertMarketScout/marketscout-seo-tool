WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Amazing.

00:01.000 --> 00:07.320
All right, guys, welcome to the freaking call.

00:07.320 --> 00:09.000
I've been waiting for this call for a long time.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.440
I know you guys have as well.

00:11.440 --> 00:15.440
First and foremost, I want to let you guys know that and keep, let me know where you

00:15.440 --> 00:17.120
guys are coming from, where you guys are tuning in from.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.320
I'm going to read them here in a second.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.800
And again, as I said, for those of you that just hopped on, as I'm trying to figure out

00:22.800 --> 00:25.920
giveaways, I'm going to try and keep up on the giveaways, Aaron Vogler, I hope you're

00:25.920 --> 00:29.280
ready to take some notes because we're going to be giving away a bunch of stuff today.

00:29.280 --> 00:34.960
But I want to see your names and why you guys did not just spam the comments, but give

00:34.960 --> 00:35.960
some value.

00:35.960 --> 00:36.960
Okay.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.560
Add some value, add some insight.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.560
That's what I want to see.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.120
That's who's going to be getting the giveaway stuff.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.120
Okay.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.340
So a couple of things really, really quick.

00:43.340 --> 00:48.160
Let me make sure I get my notes dialed in because I got a lot going on on my screen

00:48.160 --> 00:50.880
here.

00:50.880 --> 00:51.880
Let's see.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.200
Okay.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.480
Let me just tell you guys really, really quick once again.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.200
So stay on till the end.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.000
This is going to be less than an hour.

00:59.720 --> 01:00.720
So we're going to try to keep it.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.560
We are going to be giving away five coaching calls with Donnie Dre.

01:03.560 --> 01:08.560
We're going to be giving away five coaching calls with the daddy of digital real estate,

01:08.560 --> 01:13.360
Porter, who is just trailing behind Jason, but it's also getting his trash kicked because

01:13.360 --> 01:15.040
Jason's beating him by like 4,000.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.400
Come on Porter, pick it up.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.520
You can't call yourself the daddy if you're getting beat.

01:18.520 --> 01:19.520
Okay.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.880
So five calls with Donnie, five calls with daddy.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.920
We're going to get five swag winners.

01:23.920 --> 01:30.320
We're going to be giving away these t-shirts, the OG digital landlord t-shirts, maybe given

01:30.320 --> 01:32.400
some, I might even give away more than that.

01:32.400 --> 01:37.480
We're going to be doing three winners of the exclusive training library, which is like,

01:37.480 --> 01:44.560
I think it's 14 hours or more of trainings that we did that we did not put in this group.

01:44.560 --> 01:45.560
We're just going to give you the library.

01:45.560 --> 01:46.680
We're going to give three of those.

01:46.680 --> 01:50.680
We're going to give away two partial scholarships, and we're also going to be giving away a pair

01:50.680 --> 01:52.440
of the Apple AirPod Max.

01:52.440 --> 01:59.080
So we've got a ton of stuff to go through, and we are going to be covering a lot, okay?

01:59.080 --> 02:03.760
One thing I want to cover really quick before I bring Ryan Dalton on is if you did not already,

02:03.760 --> 02:07.200
I want you guys to go check out my latest post, okay?

02:07.200 --> 02:12.200
And in that post I mentioned, I said something to the extent of the Facebook group as you

02:12.200 --> 02:14.720
know it has an expiration date, okay?

02:14.720 --> 02:16.200
Why and what does that mean?

02:16.200 --> 02:18.920
I'm not going to be, this isn't going to be a dramatic thing.

02:18.920 --> 02:20.640
It's just going to happen.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.340
I've been saying this for a long time.

02:22.340 --> 02:24.740
People do not value what they do not pay for.

02:24.740 --> 02:25.740
Facts, okay?

02:25.740 --> 02:26.740
Period.

02:26.740 --> 02:27.740
End of story.

02:27.740 --> 02:29.260
You do not value what you do not pay for.

02:29.260 --> 02:34.980
I don't care if it's a freaking soft drink or if it's a course or if it's whatever the

02:34.980 --> 02:35.980
case is.

02:35.980 --> 02:41.180
If it's a vehicle that your parents gave you, when you pay for it, you value it, okay?

02:41.180 --> 02:42.180
That's just how it works, okay?

02:42.180 --> 02:44.380
You get a free training session at the gym.

02:44.380 --> 02:47.400
It's way different than if you pay 150 bucks to be there with a trainer.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.960
You value it differently, and that's just how it's going to work.

02:49.960 --> 02:55.980
So I made a post, go read it, and for those of you that are sitting there and you actually

02:55.980 --> 02:58.700
are serious about this, we have the link in there.

02:58.700 --> 03:02.580
You guys know what you got to do, and I think I even put in the hashtag, you pay the piper

03:02.580 --> 03:06.660
or you pay somebody that's paid the piper, but I just want to make sure this is clear

03:06.660 --> 03:10.620
since we have 70 people on this call right now, that if you wake up one day and the group

03:10.620 --> 03:16.120
is no longer there or it's completely different and you no longer have access, that is why,

03:16.120 --> 03:17.120
okay?

03:17.120 --> 03:19.000
People don't value what they don't pay for.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.220
So if you are somebody that's been sitting on the fence, oh my gosh, I'm not sure if

03:22.220 --> 03:26.860
I should do it, I'm going to have to take a risk, then maybe now is the time, okay?

03:26.860 --> 03:28.380
That's just all I'm going to say about it.

03:28.380 --> 03:32.020
The link is there, and also, you know what I'll do to make it very simple, let me see

03:32.020 --> 03:35.500
if I can actually do this really quick, and then we're going to get into it.

03:35.500 --> 03:40.180
I am going to mute one thing.

03:40.180 --> 03:46.820
One last thing here, let me copy this for anybody that needs it.

03:46.840 --> 03:51.840
There is the link, the digital landlords link, because that's what I posted in the thing,

03:51.840 --> 03:54.520
and no one can tell me that they didn't see it.

03:54.520 --> 03:57.680
I think that's working, okay.

03:57.680 --> 03:58.680
Hopefully that's working.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.780
Yeah, it didn't work.

04:01.780 --> 04:02.780
That's amazing.

04:02.780 --> 04:03.780
Hold on.

04:03.780 --> 04:04.780
That's funny.

04:04.780 --> 04:05.780
Just kidding.

04:05.780 --> 04:07.340
Don't follow that link.

04:07.340 --> 04:08.340
Don't follow that link.

04:08.340 --> 04:09.340
Okay.

04:09.340 --> 04:13.500
That said, guys, let me find this really quick, and then we're going to be bringing on Mr.

04:13.500 --> 04:18.000
Ryan Dalton, and it is going to be a freaking live.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Okay, where the heck is this at?

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
All right, where the hell is it at?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
There it is.

04:30.000 --> 04:38.000
One, two, three, copy, go back here, delete this.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Sorry about that, guys, and yeah, I saw the 404 message.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
My bad.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I think that one's going to work.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Still didn't work.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Okay, Aaron, what I need you to do, that's hilarious.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Aaron, I need you to go and find the link.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah, it's not working.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
That's amazing.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
I love that.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Well, just kidding.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
It's too late, guys.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
It's too late.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Okay, here's what we'll do.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Watch this.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Watch this.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
All right, where the hell is it at?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
There it is.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Okay, done.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Now I can do it.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
If that doesn't work, you know what I think the problem is?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I think it's just too late.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I think that's all it is.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
All right, let's see, paste, and yeah, there we go.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
All right, should be good now.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Look at this.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
We've got 86 people on, guys.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
There, Aaron.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Thanks for jumping in there.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I think that should work, too.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
All right, between me and Aaron, one of those suckers is going to work.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
If not, then it's just too late.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Okay, there we go.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I think that should work.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Aha.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Boom.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Okay, good to go.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
All right, that's all I'm going to say on that, guys.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
If possible, pin comment.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
There we go.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
All right, let's get in the call.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Again, we're going to be, let's give away.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Well, I'm going to bring Ryan Dalton on before we give it away.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Let me give a little bit of a preface, and let's get into today's call.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Guys, stoked about today's call because, let me give a little bit of a

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
backstory.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
Back in 2020, when I was, well, back starting in 2016, as I got into this

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
business, and I was like, hey, I got to scale this thing, I got to scale

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
this thing, I got to scale this thing.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
As I attempted to scale this business, and I finally was able to scale in

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
2020, we reached $125,000 in 2021.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
That was the max that we reached.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
By the way, I think Ryan Dalton's going to come kick my butt here shortly,

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
which I love.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
It's actually the biggest compliment ever.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
But anyway, as I did that, guys, I built this business.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
I basically felt like I willed it into existence.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
I was doing the calls.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I was doing all the sales.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
I did have some people, but it wasn't systematized.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
It wasn't clean.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
It wasn't built properly, okay?

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
I felt like I had this duct-taped business that was just hanging on by a

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
thread.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
And yes, I pulled it off.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Yes, I willed it into existence, but there was a lot of mess to clean up.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
After I hit that number, guys, I went into like a mental funk for like six

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
months, five to six months.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
And you can ask Francesca.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
We closed down the office because of COVID.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I was like, inaccessible.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Inaccessible, whatever the case is.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
I literally had like, it was weird.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
I went into this thing.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
I think because I just spent so much energy trying to get to these levels.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
My systems weren't dialed in.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I definitely didn't have everything in one place.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
My attrition started to kick in, and I just couldn't maintain that 125K.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
We were able to maintain the 100K, but the 125 we were not, okay?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
I had a business.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
I had built a business that only ran with me in the middle, and it was freaking

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
exhausting.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
I had to be there.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
I had to run the show.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
And the fact of the matter is, if somebody had come to me at that point and said,

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
hey, I want to buy your business, there is no way I could have sold that

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
business the way that it was set up.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
There's just no way.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Guys, let me just mention some of the tools that I was using at the time to try

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
and scale.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
SCM Rush, 129 bucks a month.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Majestic, 50 bucks a month.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Ahrefs, 129 bucks a month.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Pipe Drive, Entreport, Salesforce, High Level.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
These are some of the things that I've tried that worked, didn't work,

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
whatever.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
High Level.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Spent a lot of money on High Level, developing their app, whatever.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Then we got the free stuff.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
We got the Google Sheets and the Google Docs.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
We got the Asana.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
We got Call Rail.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
That was a paid one.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
We got Google Keyword Planner.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
And all these tools, guys, I've never been able to confidently recommend.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Even when I built the training inside Digital Landlords, I just told people what

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
worked for me, but I told them with a grain of salt, this is what's working for

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
me now, but use whatever you want.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
I couldn't endorse anything because I had no control over it.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I didn't know where the data came from, et cetera.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
And I did not have anything that I could recommend.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
And that is until now.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Okay?

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
And so what I'm going to be doing, I'm going to be bringing on Mr.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Ryan Dalton right now, and then we're going to get into this call.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
I'm going to explain why we got him on this call and what we've got for you

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
guys.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
It's going to be a real treat.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Okay?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Okay, here we go.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Where is he at?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Ryan Dalton.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
What's up, Nick?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Ryan Dalton, we got a full house today, bro.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
We got 87 people ready to rip on this call.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
88.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
How's that sound for a money?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
That's a party, man.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
I love it, dude.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I love it.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Okay.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
So here's what we're going to do, guys.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
I want to make sure we give away some stuff really quick.

09:37.000 --> 09:44.000
What I'm going to do, actually, is I'm going to have Jason Allred.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
I'm going to have Jason Allred go through, and I'm going to have him select

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
based.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Here's what I'm going to do.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
Anyone that's interested in a coaching call, a quick call with Donnie

09:57.000 --> 10:05.000
Dre slash Porter, I want you to drop, say, me or make a comment that

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
indicates you're interested.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Okay?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
And I'm going to have Jason go in.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
I'm going to let him pick 10 winners so we can make sure that we're not

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
spending the entire time doing the giveaways, even though we're going to

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
give away all this stuff.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
So, Jason, if you are on right now, please indicate that you're hearing

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
me.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
I'll message him as well.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
But, Jason, I'm going to put you in charge of picking the 10 people.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
You'll have five that go to you.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
Five will go to Porter.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Aaron Vogler says, Ryan's closing percentage is so high because of his

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
hair.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
I saw that, yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
I love that.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Lean in me, baby.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I love that, dude.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
It's so low maintenance.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
So, again, Jason Allred, hopefully you're on right now.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
I don't see him.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
I'm going to send him a, so I don't have to cop off of this.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I'm going to send Jason a quick message.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
And then let's get into this call.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
I don't see him messaging yet.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
So I'm just going to send him a message to Jason.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Hey, bro.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Can you choose?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Oh, he's got it.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
He's got it.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
All right.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
So Jason's going to choose 10 winners.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
That's going to be our 10 coaching calls with Porter and Donnie Dre.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Donnie Dre's at 13,600.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Porter's at 9,400.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
And these guys are both people that have literally done this with no help

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
from me.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I've never closed any Porter's deals.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
I've never given him a freebie.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
He's done this entirely alone.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Okay?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
So that said, Ryan Dalton, you ready to get into this?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Yeah.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
When do you announce on the Lamborghini giveaway?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
That one's coming.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
It really depends if we can get a thousand people on.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
No, by the way, did you see that that Kai whatever is doing a live stream

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
for one month?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
For a month long live stream.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
That's crazy.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
He had it.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Yeah, that's a totally I don't even want to know some of the things that came

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
to my mind when I thought about that.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
But yes, a lot of Red Bulls.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Yeah, it's a lot of Red Bulls.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I don't know what's going to happen there.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
So, okay.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
So, Ryan, I know you're on this call.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I'm going to just do a quick little preface.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Let's get into this.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Okay.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
So, guys, Ryan started a little over two years ago.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
You guys might have heard the story.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
You might not.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Ryan's at $87,000 per month.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Or what are you at right now?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Are you at a little bit?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
$87,000.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
I got a little bit.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
I had some churn.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
So I'm between $85,000 and $87,000.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
We've got a couple lined up this month.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
So we'll see how they go.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
So basically, Ryan's on the he's on a run rate right now to do a seven

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
figure year.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
He's already made a million dollars collected into his agency in his first

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
two years.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
But we're talking about now he's on a run rate of a million dollars per

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
year agency.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
And, dude, I have no doubt in my mind you're going to blow my number out of

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
the water, which, again, is one of it's a compliment.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
So I'm stoked about that.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Anyway, Ryan started two years ago.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
He wasn't in a weird spot with his job.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
He loves his job.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
He's got a great job.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
It pays him well.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
He's got a beautiful house, beautiful family, great, like the perfect

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
American dream life, the actual American dream.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
But he realized, like, hey, well, let me go to the offense.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
I'm going to go and find something that I can control.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
And he did.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
He did his research.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
You guys will notice today when you do the call, he's very analytical.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
He's a very intelligent person.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
And he came across and fell into rank and rent.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
Anyway, long story short, two years later, he's scaled to eighty seven

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
thousand dollars per month.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
And this is the most impressive part, guys.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
He's kept his job.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
He's raised the family.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
He still does jujitsu.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
He still travels to Brazil.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
I still see posts when he's hanging out with his kids.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
And it's been amazing to watch.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
As I've watched him scale, I remember I would hit him up and be like,

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
dude, you're crushing it.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
You know, and how are you doing it?

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
And I remember one day because he's a very organized person, very

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
systematic, he's like, well, let me show you.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
And he had put together like these different tools and everything was in

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
this very neat and organized place.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
And I was like, dude, can you do that for my agency?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
So he helped me out and he set mine up.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
And eventually this conversation came up like, dude, you should build this

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
for real, where it's an actual product that you can go in.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
People can just click a button and then boom, it's it's it's up and running.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
And for the past 18 months, it's been about 18 months, right?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Roughly.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Yeah, yeah.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Fifteen.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
But, you know, all in conceptualization.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Everything goes through it.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Fifteen months development.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Fifty, sixty thousand somewhere in that ballpark.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Okay.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
A lot of blood, sweat and tears has gone into this and it is incredible.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
I'm stoked to show you guys have Ryan show you guys this.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
So this is I called this live the only tool you need.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
And it is the only literally the only tool that I am using now.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
It's going to and we're not I'm not we're going to try not to geek out too much

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
and overwhelm you guys.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
But every single one of those tools that I mentioned, the pipe drive tool that I

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
mentioned that was a CRM that this does that the majestic that tells you how

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
many backlinks this does that I didn't even mention the SEO quake and the who is

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
sir like all these different tools.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
But every one of these tools that I was using, this will do it.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
My favorite thing just as a teaser is doing the due diligence with this tool.

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
The amount of time this would have saved me when I was doing this is incredible.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
So anyway, that said, guys, between the search volume, the ability to buy cheap

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
numbers through Twilio directly through the platform, the CRM, all of that stuff,

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
the due diligence tool, we're stoked to show you guys this.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
And again, if you'll stay till the end, we're going to be giving away a deal.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
We're going to have a deal for everyone that's on this call at the end that wants to

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
use this tool.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
I would highly recommend you say that on top of the giveaways and everything else.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
So, Ryan, give us a quick we're going to just quickly do this because I know we've

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
interviewed you, but give us just a quick anything that I missed about your story

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
about why you got into this.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
And maybe for people that are sitting there, they haven't even started rank and

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
rap.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
Why did you somebody that's a very intelligent person decide that this was the

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
model that you just said you wanted to get into?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Yeah, man.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Well, first of all, thanks for having me on.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Love being back on the call with the art of digital real estate.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Made a lot of friends out of this group.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
So hey, everybody.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Good to be on with you guys tonight.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Yeah.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
So why did I get into rank and rant?

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
So I was looking for something that used the Internet scalable and repeatable

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
and was actually passive.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
And there's a lot of people out there that talk about doing those things.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
And this is the model that I found that actually did that.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
So, you know, you put up a site, you put in the right market, you rank it, and

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
you rinse and repeat over and over again.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
And the numbers just made a lot of sense.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
And at first, I wasn't a true believer until I closed my first deal.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
I was like, oh, boy, I can do this.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Like, this is this is a thing.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
And then just went from there.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And he really went from there.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Guys, just to put it in context, for those of you that are new, like I saw one

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
of my my who is a neighbor turned to a friend, Jared Mattson.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
He lives in St. George.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
Jared, I started if you're still on this call, I started in 2016.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I didn't even make real money until 2020.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
It took me four years to start making real money.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Ryan's done this in half the time.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
And I think there's a number of reasons.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
But one of the reasons I definitely think is because you're very systematized,

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
you're very organized, you're very like build it, build the foundation.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Correct.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
And what we're going to show them today is what was part of and is part of your

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
your secret sauce, if you will.

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
So, yeah, dude, let's let's talk about like, I think we just get into it, dude.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
I think I don't.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Again, this is the only thing I'm I'm hesitant is I don't want to, like,

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
overwhelm people.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
I just want to show them a few things.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
But, guys, this like I just saw somebody like this said, does this replace go

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
high level a thousand times over?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Dude, go high level is built for like digital whatever.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
This is literally ace.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Go ahead.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Go ahead.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
This is also not a go high level like white label.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
There's some people that try to make some tool every now and then, and they

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
just like put a sticker on from go high level.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
This is like this is proprietary technology made for rank and rent by rank

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
and renters.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
So when we made this, it was by me doing the business and then going to other

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
people who had version one of this and said, hey, what's working?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
What's not working?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
What do you like?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
What do you want?

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
And people like, you know, like Mike, we used rank and range in one point.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Oh, and, you know, I love that guy.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
And he is one of the people that gave me a lot of feedback like, hey, this is

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
what works.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
This is what I'm doing with my agency.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
We built something that is made by the rank and rank community for the rank

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
and rank.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
We're not like cobbling together all these tools from all these places where

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
they've got people to do SEO or people to do website.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
There's a lot of general purpose tools.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
There needs to be something made by our community that is doing this business

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
model.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
And it just didn't exist.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Right.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
And so a lot of people are paying like a lot of like a lot of money to put

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
together tools that you need, like a piece of it.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Right.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
You need a keyword planner.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
You need like some element of someone else's tool that is helpful for your

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
business, but there's a lot you don't need.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
So that's what we set out to do.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Right.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
We wanted to build the all in one purpose built tool for people that do this

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
business model by people that do this business model.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Exactly.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
And the best products, let's be honest, the best products and services

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
always come when someone gets into an industry.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
They feel the pain points.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
They see the pain points and they're like, Hey, I'm going to solve that issue.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Good.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Good.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Quick example that we're going to get in and show these guys.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I'm going to use a farming example.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
One of the biggest pain points in farming with Alpha Alpha.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
Hey, Porter can testify to this is when you when you cut the crop, it's on the

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
ground, you turn it, it's dry.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
You have to wait for this perfect moisture.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Right.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
This perfect, the dew has to come in.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
And if it's too dry, the leaves fall off.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
If it's too wet, you risk it lighting on like catching on fire, sitting in the

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
stack.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
And this company came along called Staley, Staley West.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
And they built a freaking dew machine that you literally pull on the back of

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
your tractor.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
And it literally allows you to go in the middle of the day if you want.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
And it creates a perfect moisture.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
You can bail with a perfect moisture.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
And they sell these machines at like two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Right.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Per machine.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
And they're good.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
They're literally selling them like eggs off the shelf because it solved such a

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
pain point.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
But it took somebody in the industry realizing, hey, instead of waking up at 1

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
a.m. to check the dew temperature and then taking a nap and then checking it

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
again and doing this every year until you die, let's just create the product.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
The best products come from people in the industry that have had the pain, felt

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
the pain and developed them.

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
So this is a rank and rent tool just for rank and rent built by rank.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I know there's other people that are building tools.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
They're like, yeah, there's a rank and rent.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
But you know what they're doing is they're going wide.

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
They're trying to get the digital market marketers that are doing SMMA and

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
doing this.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
This is for rank and rent.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Done.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
That's it.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Why?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
And this is one other thing, dude.

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
That shows you guys how confident Ryan and I are in this in this industry.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Right.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
We're not hedging our bets saying, well, if rank and rent doesn't work, we can

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
go to this other ancillary market or this parallel market.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
We are betting our entire futures on rank and rent.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
This is built just for rank and rent.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Okay.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
So it is catered to rank and rent the way that we do it.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
And I'm stoked about it.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
So Ryan, I'm going to give you co-hosts.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
I think you should just show them the freaking tool, by the way, the version

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
1.0, which took some setting up and, and, and, you know, duct taping some

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
tools together was kind of like your, your Petri dish.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
You had a 100 people that, that, that did it.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Yeah.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Yeah.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
We had like 200 and tune.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
I forget the exact number.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
It's on my website.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
I went and looked at it.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
200 and something.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Yeah.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
It's 200 and something people that built their agencies, usually 1.0.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
And it was so successful with 1.0 that we decided to really polish it and make

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
it something that's going to be really, really useful for people that doesn't

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
require all the setup.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
So we used to have to do a bunch of no code things to pull some things

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
together.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
And we got rid of that, right?

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
We just make it point and click kind of thing.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
So you want to get into it?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Let's do it, bro.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
I'm stoked.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Um, by the way, this is like one of, I don't have that many bookmarks.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
This is one of my bookmarks.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Now I wake up, open it up and, uh, and I can see my tasks.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Like, yeah, just show them.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
I just gave you co-hosts.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
So let's just get in the tool, dude.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
All right.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
All right.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
So I'm not, I'm going to say this up front, but we're not going to show you

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
the whole thing.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
Cause we don't have some fun stuff.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
We're going to show you some things that are going to make your lives easier

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
and it would be more fun.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Right.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
Cause that's a big part of doing this is having fun doing it.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
So.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
All right.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Here we are.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
So, uh, I'm going to start here and just, uh, kind of talk through what you

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
see on the left.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
We're not going to actually look at all of these cause we just don't have

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
time for it, but I'm talking about what all these do them to give you guys

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
some, uh, some due diligence.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
So if you guys want to drop a city and a niche into the chat, maybe someone

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
can keep an eye on it and we can go back and look at some options for due

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
diligence.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
We do some live due diligence here with you guys.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
Yeah, guys, let's get some city and niche options.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
If you guys have any that maybe you're looking at, or maybe you have a niche

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
and you want to try a different city, let's do that.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
And, uh, while Ryan's getting into it and then once, yeah, let's, let's go

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
from there.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
I'll have some people give some, some examples.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Cool.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
So I pulled up a dummy account here.

23:24.000 --> 23:29.000
Um, and I'm going to show you guys, you know, when you log in on this left

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
sidebar, you can see all the features and this is has what is required to do

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
this business model.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
It allows all of your data to talk to each other in the right way, where you

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
have efficiency in the way that you build your agency.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
So the first is this task tracker, right?

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
You've got to know what your goals are and you got to have at the task level

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
things that you're doing to move the needle, right?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
It's the best way to describe that.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
And then you've got due diligence.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
So we're going to dig into some due diligence.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
I'm going to show you guys this.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Uh, this is the work and have fun today.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
We've got a site portfolio.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
All your sites are in one spot, right?

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
You can just put all the essential things you need to know about all your

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
sites and what stage development they're in prospects.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
You can pull in all your prospect information, what your goals are for your

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
prospects, your target subscription, right?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
It's all right.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Phone numbers, emails, your clients, you pull it on your cloud.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I've got Michael Jackson is my client, right?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Uh, we've got client information in here.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
So you've got a CRM, a lead tracker.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
So you can't see any doubt in here, but you pull in all your leads.

24:30.000 --> 24:36.000
Um, I've got a little rock concrete, all the calls, call recordings,

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
uh, you can, you know, annotate them with messages, goodbye tracking numbers.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
And the cool thing I love about this, that I love about this is the tracking

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
numbers you get in rank and run engine.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
Uh, you can set up automated SMS for your business owners to get a text

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
message when the lead comes in, which is the number one retention pool that

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
I can impress upon you guys.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Uh, and you've got a site analyzer, which I'll show you guys here in a

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
minute where you can break down your, your sites, uh, getting the SEO

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
information you need, and then a keyword tool to do manual keyword work.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
So let's just hold on Ryan real quick, because I, we kind of brushed

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
over that.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Yeah.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Ryan is the master at low attrition.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
That's how he's been able to scale so rapidly.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
His, his attrition is very, very low.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
I want you to just say that again about the number one thing that you can do

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
for keeping low attrition for, for decreasing churn just really quick.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Yeah, totally.

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
The number one thing, the absolute, I wouldn't even do rank and rent if I

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
didn't have this feature because I've, I have tested, um, markets where, or

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
websites that I have not enabled this.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
And then ones where I have enabled it and the retention is astronomically

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
higher.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
I don't have a number for you, but it is way, way higher.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
And that is the automatic SMS notification when a lead comes in.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
So, um, this is the configuration for this number for a little bit.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
This is the configuration for this number for Little Rock Concrete, right?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I don't actually own Little Rock Concrete.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
That's, uh, I'm sure someone does, but, uh, you have a default SMS lead

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
notification down here, which basically just says, Hey, you have a new lead

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
from, and then it'll say Little Rock Concrete and it puts the caller's

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
number.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
So every time that business owner has a call that comes in, a lot of them

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
don't answer their phone.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
That's just the nature of these business owners.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
They get a text message that says you have a new lead for Little Rock

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Concrete.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
They know it came from me.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
So they don't think that, Oh, that came from my sources or someone, you

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
know, gave me that lead.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
That wasn't this guy I'm paying for.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
They know that it came from me.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
And all they have to do is scroll through their text messages to see how

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
many leads they got in the last month.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
And so that's enabled by default with a random retention.

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
Tell me that, like, I guarantee if that, if there was a tool that just did

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
that and it costs $20 a month, that people would pay for that.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Yeah.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Just that one little thing.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
How many times?

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
I want you guys, for those of you that have been doing this, how many times

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
have you had business owners?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
You're sending them 30 leads.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
You're sending them 50 leads a month.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
Even you're sending them 15 and they're, they just sound ungrateful.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
And it's, it's because they're, they're ignorant.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
They don't even know the leads are coming from you.

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
This sounds so simple, but literally as soon as I could lead comes in, it's

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
just that constant reminder.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Oh, that was Ryan.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Oh, that was Nick.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
All that was evergreen.

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
And that was, and that right there will do so much more than a stupid report.

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
Phone call checking on their kid and it's automated.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
It's done.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
And that's just one tiny little thing that Ryan was basically skimming over.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
I just want to make sure that you guys heard that properly.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
So anyway, keep going.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
A hundred percent.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Yeah.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
That retention is essential.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
Like that, that is, that is the number one tool that I've used to get to

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
87,000 a month is they get a lead.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
They get a text message.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
They know it's from me.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
And so everything that comes in every month, I get credit for.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Right.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
They're never going to question it.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
And I can then use that to keep them.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
If they ever call a complaint, Hey, I'm not getting enough leads.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Like, Hey, let's pull up your text messages.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Show me how many you got in the last 30 days.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Right.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
And I'll count them.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
I'll make them count them.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Right.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
One, two, three, four, like, Oh, I got 28.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Like, all right, let's figure out what else is going on because it's not the

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
lead volume.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Right.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
And that's what this tool enables.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
You can also do a custom notification.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Right.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
And you can also do it like, Hello, you have a new lead from little rock

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
concrete.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
This is evergreen leads.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
Thanks for being a great client or whatever, something goofy like that.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Right.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
You can customize it.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Amazing.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Amazing.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Okay.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Sorry to stop your stop your flow.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
I just had to mention that it sounds like it's just like one little piece,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
but it's such a valuable piece.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
So let's keep going.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Yeah, totally.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
All right.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Just some due diligence.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
So this is, this is what I'm like.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
This is what I've been geeking out on too.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
They're geeking out on it.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
This was the most fun part to build.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
Like I, this was a lot of hard work, but it was really fun to build this

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
part.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
So we're going to do some due diligence.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
We're going to jump in here and do some live due diligence.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
And we're going to pipe in some real information in real time.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
So this screen is your due diligence.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Empire mapping.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Right.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
You've got to know where you're going to succeed and where you're not.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
And so what we pull in here.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Okay.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
So this is the, this is the, this is the, this is the, this is the,

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
this is the record.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
Automatically when you click a button is all the things that you need to

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
know to enter a market.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Right.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
So I'm just going to point some things out here.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
You guys are smart.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
You guys can probably read this, but this record right here,

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
let's just grab one. Let's do like.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
This is a paint one.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Let's see.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Hey,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
does it let you zoom in a little bit? Can you like,

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
Plus just to, yeah, I know it kind of skews a little.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
That's good right there. That's perfect.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Cool.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Let's do a.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
I got it. I got an example too. When you're ready, we can do this one.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
We could do concrete contractor, Miami.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
Just because everyone's familiar with concrete Miami sounds fun.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
It sounds warm.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
So that, and Laura's always on the call. So let's do that one.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
All right, Laura.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Let's do it.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
All right.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
So here we're going to click add a record, right?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
So we're going to add location and this top right corner.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
So while I'm setting this up, we're going to need,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I'm going to tell you guys what we need. All right.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
We're going to need, we've got our location, Miami.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
We've got our niche concrete.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
We're going to need to grab the top three competitor domains.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
We'll get those in a minute.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
So right now, if you're overseas,

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
this is only for the United States for now. All right.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
We're going to bring it to our buddies over in the UK, Canada,

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
in Australia.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
Right now it's just the U S so your country by default is going to be the

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
U S.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
The state we're in through Florida.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Our city.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
We're going to do Miami, but look, here's what you guys need to know.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
You guys are marketers. You guys run marketing agencies.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
The Miami Fort Lauderdale DMA region is going to capture the greater

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Miami region.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
This is your advertising region where you're going to have the highest

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
search volume. All right.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
So we're going to pull that in.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Your niche is a lot of niches.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
You can add your own if you want to concrete contractor is a,

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
is a classic.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
So it's already in there.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
So we're going to put in all of our secondary keywords.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
So we're going to put in all of our secondary keywords.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Call driven.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Just a reminder. Like it's gotta be called driven guys.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Primary keywords.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
Concrete contractor.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
And our school put all of our secondary keywords.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
You're going to put in your core keyword list here, right?

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
These are your pop money keywords, right? So Sam concrete.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Press enter.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
Everyone loves concrete drive.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
I think just concrete itself too. Right.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
See concrete, concrete driveways, patios.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Sidewalks are pretty good ones too.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Concrete.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Sidewalk. All right.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
So you've got six core keywords, right?

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
So Nick teaches you guys to build your core keyword list.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
We're going to grab some of those keywords.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Put them in here. These are our money makers, right?

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
These are the ones with the highest search volume.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Correct.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
And then this is the Miami area, right? So a pretty big area.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
We know that upfront.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
A lot of active businesses, like I don't have to look and I know that.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
So we're going to put many, if you're unsure, you can, you know,

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Nick's taught you guys.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
And me how to do your due diligence when looking at these businesses.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
So you can do your competitor analysis.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
But here's where the money is going to be made for you guys.

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
All of those manual entries that you're doing to fill out spreadsheets,

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
to put in your competitor domain information.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
You're, you're not going to have to do that anymore.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
So if I do concrete contractor, Miami.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
I'm just going to grab the top three domains that I see.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
So I'm not going to pull a lot of thought into this,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
but I'm just going to grab the ones.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
So, and let me say this while you're, while you're grabbing those.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
What I, what I've been doing guys.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
I have my keyword list.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
So I have got my concrete concrete contractor, whatever.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
I opened the five, six windows.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
And before I start, I just type it in.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
I type in concrete Miami, Florida, concrete contractor, Miami, Florida.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
All the way down.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
And then quickly, I just toggle between all six.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
And I go, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
I grab the say, if it shows up in the organic.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
You know,

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
let's say four out of the seven times, four out of the six times.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Boom. That's a top competitor.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
I'm dropping it in. It takes an extra two minutes.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
That's how I do it to make sure that I'm getting, you know,

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
the right keywords, right competitors.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
But Ryan's doing this off screen just to kind of give you guys an idea.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
It takes two seconds, but it takes two seconds.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah, so that's exactly right.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
So, you know, you guys want to go look at, you know, which,

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
which keywords these keep consistently pulling up for,

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
but we're going to pull it in those domains.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
Put them in right here. I'm just going to put in the.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
All right.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
The root level. All right.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
And then the available domain. So you go to go daddy, right.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
And whatever brand you're building, whatever your concrete,

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
whatever you call your concrete brand or your lead generation brand

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
that you're building, right.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
We're just going to go look at that domain and do like concrete

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
contractor.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
Rose Miami.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Right. So it's available, right? We checked. It's available.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
And the future we want to see is available.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
So we're going to go to go.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Right.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
So it's available, right? We checked. It's available.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
And the future we want to make it to where you just buy this

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
straight in the platform,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
but you got to make sure that the domain is available.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Well,

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
we're going to put TBD go or no go put TBD and then you can put

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
comments here, right?

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
If you have a further new diligence,

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
everyone has their own little like take on due diligence.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
You can put that in here.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Hey, hold on.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Yeah.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
We're counting. Oh, it's done.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
I was going to have us count, bro.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
The due diligence is done.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
That's crazy, bro.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
Yeah. Like that. It's done. So due diligence is over for that record.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Right. So here's what we've got here, guys.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
We've got, you know,

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Up here.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
We're indicating this is the name of the domain.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
All right.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
So it's the first thing that you're building it or your VA or

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
however you're going to do it. Right.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
That's the domain I want.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Like my VA is building it.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Go build this on this domain.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Go buy it.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Right.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Here's our city. This is the DMA region.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
So it's the one.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
So it's the one.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
So it's the one.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
So it's the one.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
So it's the one.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
So it's the one.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Right.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Here's our city.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
This is the DMA region.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
So it's the wider area.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Right.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Many active businesses,

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
concrete contractor,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
the population will appear.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
DMA region.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
So if you do the smaller area,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
you can see what the population is,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
but you're not going to need that when you do a DMA region,

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
because it's going to meet your criteria for sure.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Your primary keyword up here.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Right.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
And then over on the left, you know,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
you can change these to your low-hanging fruit.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Right.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Like yes, no.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Here's the cool stuff.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Right.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Your primary keywords.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
The first thing over here on the left search volume of 1300.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I'd say that that that meets the due diligence.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
I think you're safe to go into Miami concrete on the,

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
on the search volumes.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Yeah.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Yeah.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Yeah.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
There's enough people looking for concrete Miami for sure.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
You see the calls per click.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
So seven 70.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
For this keyword.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Right.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
So pretty good.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
And then over here,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
your secondary keywords all appear.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
So these are all of our money keywords that Nick trained you guys.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
Like which are the ones that are going to be your core keywords?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
They're all pulled in right here.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
And we get the calls per click data that is as fresh as you can get it.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
This is as accurate as you can get it.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
If you get a not applicable or not known or whatever,

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
that means that it's just not available in Google.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
So we're pulling all that in here so that you can quickly make a decision.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Is there enough search volume?

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
How much is it going to cost me?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Now I want you to show the competitor analysis.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
And then I want to mention a couple of things on this guys.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Well, let me say number one,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
number one thing that I love about this,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
it saves all the records.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
How many times have you guys done a due diligence?

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
You'll wait three months and you think of a city.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
You're like, dude,

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
I think I did the due diligence on that and you're looking in your Google

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
drive or worse,

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
you're somebody like me and you did it on the freaking paper and you're

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
looking through your folders,

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
your Manila folders and you're in your little cabinet and you can't find it.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
So you go and you spend another 45 minutes.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Everything saved.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
You can go look at it in two seconds.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
So go through the competitor analysis really quick as well.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Just just quickly.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
You can just show these cards.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
It's crazy down here.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Yeah.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Yeah.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
So what do you grab these top three?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
So you got to know who you got to beat to get to the top.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
You want to rank organically.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
You got to know how you're going to get there.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
And so you can look at these top three competitors.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
So you put in that domain age, you put in,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
you know, you put in their domain, right?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
And it's going to spit out immediately their domain age,

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
how many backlinks they've got, citation flow, domain authority,

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
page authority and trust flow.

37:23.000 --> 37:28.000
So the essential industry standard SEO metrics just pop right to the top and

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
we pull in that domain.

37:29.000 --> 37:34.000
So what we're doing is we're using a few APIs to pull that in at the same time.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
So when you had to go, it all pops up at once for you.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
All right.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
So here's better one, two and three better.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Better two has been there for a minute, right?

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
They're 28 years so that they've been around for a little while.

37:46.000 --> 37:52.000
But you can see like quickly, like Captain Miami concrete contractor,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
you can beat that guy like or gal, right?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Like that is not, that is not hard to beat.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
So, you know, you can get into that top three and this is what you're able to

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
surface really quickly when you're able to pull the data into the right spot at

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
the right time.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Here's another thing I like, guys.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
Let's say that you're doing concrete flat work and you decide, you know what,

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
that you get a new client or you're prospecting a new client and the new

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
client does a lot of decorative concrete and you want to go and you want to

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
quickly look in the same city, but you want to look at some different keywords.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
Show them how easy it is to quickly edit a keyword and rerun the search.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Yes.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
You can just click edit, pop this out.

38:30.000 --> 38:36.000
Like if you wanted to do decorative concrete, add your new keyword, update

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
the location.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Done.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
And there it goes.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
All right.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
Decorative concrete, $2.00 a click.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
I love that.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
It feels good.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
And that's actually hit the sweet spot, by the way.

38:48.000 --> 38:54.000
So, guys, some people that haven't done the due diligence, like I've literally

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
personally done over a thousand.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
I can, I can definitively say I have done over a thousand freaking, I've probably

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
done over 500 on a paper.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Right.

39:03.000 --> 39:08.000
And I would like at my prime when I was really good at it.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Right.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
And I had two monitors and the whole deal, I would get one done in like 22

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
minutes or whatever the case was.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
And I was super stoked, but it was frying my brain.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
Right.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
We've been talking through this entire thing, chatting on chat.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
That took us like all of seven minutes.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
And we're not even locked in.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Right.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
The amount of time that I have saved on due diligence is bananas.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
What it allows you to do is it allows you to look at way more cities.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
It allows you to break down way more cities and niche combinations to find that

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
perfect city.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.000
I mean, dude, just for this, this is the thing that I've used the most and

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
played around the most with.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
And it's just a small part.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
So anything else you want to cover on due diligence, any questions that people

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
have on due diligence.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
I saw that there's a couple of things that I wanted to address really quick.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
We've got a bunch of people that I recognize in the house here.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Let's see.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
Simon says Ryan, Ryan Dalton out here selling shovels in a gold rush.

40:08.000 --> 40:14.000
You know, it's funny about that is yes and no, because Ryan's an opportunist,

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
but also at the same time, if you can't use that analogy because those people

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
only sold shovels, this would be like somebody that had the mind that was

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
making a lot of money, that was making the primary money from the mine and

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
was like, Hey, I found this shovel that works better.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
You should try it too, because there's an opportunity.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
So I know what you're saying.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
And yeah, there's an opportunity.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
We're not going to, we're going to call a spade a spade.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
However, Ryan makes his money from doing rank and rent the same way that I

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
don't make my money from doing the program.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
That's not how I made millions of dollars doing the thing, selling and

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
selling leads, renting simple websites.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
Me and Ryan, before we ever opened our mouth about it, we made the million

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
dollars, the multiple million dollars.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
So, but yeah, of course it's a great opportunity.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
So Chris says, yeah, I'm in the mine with you.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
I'm down there.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
We're all in the mine together and I'm tired of having bad tools down in the

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
mine.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Exactly.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
And I'm all about people with good tools.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
And if someone wants to come with like a superior sandwich that is dust proof,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
whatever, I'll buy that too.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
So there's, you know, it's all about opportunity here.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Okay.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Real quick.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
Chris says in this example, what stands out about those data points, good or

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
bad, et cetera.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Let's, let's answer that question and then let's move to a couple of their

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
features and then give away some t-shirts.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
For sure.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
Yes.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
We'll breeze right through that.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
There's some great training on that.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
Like I got to give a shout out to Nick's training.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Like he, he dives into all this stuff.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
If you're, if you're not taking that, you should, because you can get really

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
what these metrics mean, right?

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
These are the metrics that allow you to assess if you have a viable market.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
So let's look at this one.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
We got up right here, right?

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
So competitor three is Captain Miami Concrete Contractor.

41:51.000 --> 41:56.000
So you, you have to know what it's going to take for you to beat this

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
website to rank higher than them.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
That's the purpose of the competitor analysis.

42:01.000 --> 42:07.000
The older a domain is and the higher the numbers are in those other metrics,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
the harder they are to beat.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
So a domain that is less than a year old.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
Is way easier to beat than one that's 28 years old.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Right?

42:19.000 --> 42:24.000
So you're able to look at these and say, Hey, am I going to be able to do

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
what it takes to get in those top three spots or another example?

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
And we're not going to go through all of them.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
You could do a whole hour on just this, but backlinks, this guy has three.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Okay.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
You could do three backlinks before this call in, if you know how to do

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
them, but this guy has 1600.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
And so that indicates to me that they'd gotten SEO guy that helps their

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
concrete company.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Right?

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
So now I'm battling this SEO guy to be competitor number two.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
So each of these metrics will give you insights into what it's going to

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
take for you to win.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
And that's what I'm about.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
I want to win, baby.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
And I want to win fast.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
And so I want to know what it's going to take to do that.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
And that's what due diligence does for you.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
A hundred percent.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
And just so you guys know, also, this is what's so cool about Ryan having

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
developed this tool is like this, it's not going to be a hundred percent

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
perfect out the gate.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
There's going to be things and we're getting feedback as we go.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
We're building like adding changing.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Like one thing I think that would be really valuable.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
I've talked to Ryan about is if we had a way that you could click on the

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
backlinks and it could open up the backlink profile, because we know that

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
backlinks aren't created equal there.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
You could have three good backlinks could be better than 1600.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
So we understand that if it's a competitive niche, you might have to go

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
and you have to analyze those backlinks.

43:35.000 --> 43:40.000
That's something that we can add because Ryan is overseeing the development

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
of this.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
So real quick, I'm going to give away some t-shirts and then let's get into

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
a couple of the features.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Reggie.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
So what I'm going to do, Ryan, sorry, Aaron Vogler, if you're on, please

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
help us.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
And just so you can note who's the winners here, but I'm going to give away

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
some t-shirts.

43:55.000 --> 44:03.000
Reggie Klassen met Reggie in Sierra Leone of all places back in 2010.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
And he's on this call.

44:04.000 --> 44:09.000
I'm going to give him a t-shirt and you can choose which one you want.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
What you guys will do if you guys are a winner of the swag, you're going to

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
message Aaron.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Aaron's going to send you a coupon code.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
You go in.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
It's completely free shipping and all.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Get your pick your size.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
We'll ship directly to your house.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
So we got Reggie Klassen.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
We've got let's give away.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
If anyone stands out to you, let me know, Ryan.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Let's.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Santos.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Santos.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
A t-shirt.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Who?

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Santos.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Santos.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
What's the last name?

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Garza.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
Santos Garza t-shirt winner.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Let's see.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Who else?

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
I saw a really good comment that I wanted to give because I liked that.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
The comments seem good.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
All right.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Right here.

44:51.000 --> 44:56.000
Where the hell was we got a lot of comments coming in?

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
Jason Bertok.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
You know, you don't, if you don't ask, you don't receive.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
He says he wants a t-shirt.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Give him a t-shirt.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Let's give Jason Bertok.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
You know, everyone's going to start dropping that.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Let's see.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Who else we got?

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
Let's give Morgan Williams t-shirt winner.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
Size XL, by the way.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
These are great.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Versatile t-shirts.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
No, I'm just kidding.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
We don't make money on t-shirts.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
We don't make shit.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
We don't make money on t-shirts.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
These are just for fun.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
I only go shirtless.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Okay.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
You know what, Landon, just because of that comment, I think we're going to give Landon

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
t-shirt.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Landon t-shirt winner.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
He just used the reverse psychology, the reverse.

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
Let's give away one more.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Mason Black says he wears large.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
That's an assumptive sale.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Let's freaking go.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Mason Black.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
That's t-shirt winner.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
There's five.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
We'll give away some more guys.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
We still have to give away the headphones.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
We still got to give away a couple of partial scholarships.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
Let's go through a couple more things in our last 10 minutes here.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Ryan.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Yeah, for sure.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
All right.

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
I think we saw a question earlier about data privacy.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Look, no one sees this.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
We take data privacy really seriously.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
I'm not in here stealing your due diligence.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
I've got my own agency planned out for the next year.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
I'm not in here ordering your due diligence records.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
Due diligence is sacred.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
It's your agency building your future.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
It's building your rank and run empire.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
And so data privacy is something that I'm a very like private privacy

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
oriented person so that we built the software in accordance with that.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
We also are pulling this data straight from the pipe guys.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
You're not getting more accurate keyword research anywhere else.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
So let me show you guys what I mean by this.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
So this is a site analyzer.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
And so we're going to do that site.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Let's just grab that domain that was old.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
What's that?

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
C E C O concrete.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
All right.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
So they've been around a minute.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
So you go in here and see like, all right, what am I up against?

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
And we're going to pull all that information in, right?

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
We're going to do a little bit more of a deep dive.

46:56.000 --> 47:03.000
So right here from the top, we've got citation flow, trust flow, domain authority and page authority.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
Like these are the top four metrics that we look at.

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
And beneath them, you see our backlinks and backlinks over time.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
Give us a picture of how much attention they're putting into being competitive.

47:16.000 --> 47:21.000
So down here, you can see for the year, right, they're working on stacking these backlinks.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
Like they got someone that knows what they're doing that's involved.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
So that's an indication to me that that's going to be pretty tough.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
Right.

47:28.000 --> 47:33.000
And you can see another detail about their backlink information here, where they're referring, all that kind of stuff.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
We're not going to get into all that, but I'll give you guys what I mean.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Let's grab this other one.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
So if you want to go deep dive captain Miami, that's just a wild name.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
All right.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
That's like one of those massage parlor type of things.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
I'm not sure that's a concrete company.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Yeah, I don't know what that is.

47:50.000 --> 47:55.000
So this guy, look, look, you guys see the difference in these numbers you guys see up here.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
We're returning some low numbers, right?

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
Low backlinks, lost backlinks.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
This is going to be easier to beat three referring domains.

48:06.000 --> 48:12.000
You can do a deep dive and look at, hey, are they actually doing what it takes to stay in that spot?

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Or can I go win?

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
So you can analyze all your competition.

48:16.000 --> 48:26.000
You can see their anchor text and referring domains and all that kind of stuff that you guys are probably paying a lot of money for with fancy tools right here with your keyword planner.

48:26.000 --> 48:32.000
This would be a majestic type of a tool, which would cost you $50 per month, just as a heads up.

48:32.000 --> 48:40.000
Now, it doesn't do everything majestic does yet, but that's something that we can work towards with showing, you know, more of the backlink profile and going in a deep dive like that.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
But anyway, dope.

48:43.000 --> 48:50.000
Can you show them the the project management piece, which I love?

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
You know what I love about it?

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
I'll just pop in there.

48:52.000 --> 49:00.000
Sometimes I'll see something like, for example, we have this GMB that wasn't ranking and it was in one of our locations that we have.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
We're making a decent amount of money.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Oh, your screen got smooshed like this.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
I think it's just maybe unshare and share again.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
It looks like it's like that big.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I don't know.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
Just went dark.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
I don't know what happened here.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I'm going to come back.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
No, try it again.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Anyway.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Okay, that's better.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
I'll go in and I went in the other day and I went in.

49:20.000 --> 49:31.000
I put like optimize GMB get three reviews by end of week and I assigned it to Francesca just to kind of piss her off because she basically runs the company and she was humble about it.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
She actually didn't even say a word.

49:33.000 --> 49:38.000
She completed the task, moved the card over and it was done.

49:38.000 --> 49:44.000
So anyway, I love the project management task tracker is super nice, too.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Yeah, so I mean, I built this.

49:46.000 --> 49:59.000
I've had over 3000 tasks that we've done in the last year that I write for myself or I write for my team or, you know, I'm big on knowing like what is the actual specific thing that I have to do to move the needle.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Like this is the Hormose thing.

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
Like what's required and I put what's required into my task tracker.

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
So you can see that we've got four columns.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Here's what I got to do.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Here's what I'm doing in progress.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
Here's what I finished.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
And here's where I'm stuck.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
And that's the backlog.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
Right.

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
So this is a pretty straightforward project management tool, but it ties in with other agents.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
You're not full sheets or Trello or whatever.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
You're doing it right here in the tool.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
So what's our task?

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
We need to optimize GVP.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
Right.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
And then you put in your details where you need to do.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Right.

50:38.000 --> 50:47.000
So, you know, add photos, make posts and reply to reviews.

50:47.000 --> 50:58.000
And then you add, you know, whatever you can add images or documents or pictures or videos or whatever you need to add to like, you know, make sure that that task has the data that it needs to be completed.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
Assigned prioritization.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
This is very high priority.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
You can add labels.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
Right.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
This is GVP optimization.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
Probably going to add this one.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
So we're going to add a new label.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Right.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
I'm the owner.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
Right.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
It's just me.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
But you can also have people at sub account users.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
So I've got me and then I have my agency.

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
Nick would have him and then Francesca and everybody else is there.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
So you're going to assign them, you know, sub user.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
I've got a sub user.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
I call them that.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
A task is useless without a deadline.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
Right.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
We're going to do this by Friday.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
And then some people like to color code.

51:35.000 --> 51:40.000
And so we just fill up this with everything that we need to do that's required.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
Right.

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
And just chip away at it to move the needle forward over and over and over.

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
And then that's how the revenue comes in.

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
Sorry, I'm over here just trying to answer as many questions as possible.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
Yeah, I know there's going to be a lot of questions that people have.

51:56.000 --> 52:01.000
One thing that we're going to be doing is a separate Facebook group for

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
just people that are on this tool.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
You can go in, you can ask questions.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
There's going to be trainings, et cetera.

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
Because I know there's going to be a lot of questions, but real quick.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
We have that.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Yeah.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
You can join my Facebook group.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Right.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
So rank and run engine is the Facebook group and you can jump in.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
And if you guys want to join that, ask questions or whatever.

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
I think you were saying that they're asking about that kind of thing.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
Yeah.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Well, like I just saw some questions that were very specific.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
I mean, we could spend two hours answering questions and they're there.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
Some of them are simple questions.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
I just was letting them know that there is a Facebook group.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
There's ongoing support, et cetera.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
What I would like to do really quick though, because I do want to respect

52:40.000 --> 52:45.000
everyone's time and maybe what we'll do is let's announce the winner.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
Let's choose a winner of the headphones.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Let's give out the discount code.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
I'm going to let everyone know about the scholarship and then let's stay on

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
for like maybe five, 10 minutes to answer a few questions and then we'll pop

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
off. That way people that need to go can go.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
Just respect that.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
Okay.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
So we did the t-shirts.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
What's the deal?

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
So what's the deal?

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
Let's talk about the promo for those that are on this call that join.

53:09.000 --> 53:14.000
I think that we talked about like this will go through at least the next

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
24 hours.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
This promo code that you're going to be giving.

53:18.000 --> 53:22.000
Now there are a few people I want to mention this that may have been in,

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
you know,

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
my community inside digital landlords that you guys have the ability to have

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
you're part of our beta group.

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
This can they can still like kind of doubt they can kind of double dip and

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
get this as well.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
Correct.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Yeah. They didn't sign up for beta,

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
which I really appreciate that by the way,

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
if you were a beta user and you're in digital landlords,

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
they helped me find kind of the edge cases to work out.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
Right.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
And I really appreciate that.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
That meant a lot to me.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
But now we're opening this up to the wider rink and rent community,

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
starting here as an exclusive and artificial real estate.

53:56.000 --> 54:01.000
And we have a promo code for this group.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
That's if all caps landlord 24,

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
we'll give you 20% off for your first two months of whatever plan that you

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
get,

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
or it'll give you 20% off for the year if you wanted to get a plan for the

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
year, which is a real steal.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
That is exclusive for you guys here in artificial real estate.

54:18.000 --> 54:23.000
Landlord 24 all caps landlord, the number 24, right?

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
That man. Yeah. Yep.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Okay.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Go ahead.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Yeah.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Landlord 24 and join our Facebook group.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
It's just called rink and rent engine.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
We're in there talking about how to build the agency.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
It's a good time.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
I love it.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
Okay. Two more things.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
We mentioned that we're going to be doing two skull,

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
two partial scholarships for digital landlords.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
We're going to be doing two,

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
two partial scholarships for digital landlords.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
And we're going to be doing two,

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
two partial scholarships for digital landlords.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
And we're going to be doing two on that because I want to actually

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
pick people that I think are going to succeed and have the best chance of

54:57.000 --> 55:02.000
succeeding.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
For that one specifically,

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
if that is something that you are interested in again,

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
it's just going to be two, it's going to be a partial.

55:07.000 --> 55:12.000
It's not going to be completely free.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
It's just going to be two winners.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
It's going to be a partial,

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
but that is something that we are going to be including.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
So that's the scholarship piece.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
Now, as for the air, the, the Apple,

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
air pod max there,

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
I think they're like 580 bucks, something like that.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
I've actually never used them, but everyone I know that has them,

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
loves them.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I don't know if that's cause everyone's just like.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
Fanatical about Apple or not, but right.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
They're awesome.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Oh, you have them. You have them. Amazing. Okay.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Okay. So there we go. So Ryan, let's,

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
I think we should ask a relevant question or completely irrelevant.

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
And based on the answers, let's pick somebody. So let's, I'm going to let you,

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
whether it's a rank and rent related question,

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
whether it's a purpose driven question,

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
whether it's something completely off the wall,

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
what question should we let people and guys,

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
what we're going to do is we're going to have you guys,

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
we're going to give you like one minute answer in the comments.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
And from those comments, we're going to be choosing a winner.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
Now don't be that person that fricking drops 15 comments or I'm going to not

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
choose you. Um, what should, what's, what's the question, right?

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
And by the way, we didn't come in with a plan.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
We just thought we kind of go with the flow on this. What should we ask?

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
You know, you know what I love hearing from people.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
I love hearing what their why is.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Why you're what.

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
A rank in rent agency. What's your reason for doing that?

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
That I love getting answers to that question.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
I love that. So what we're going to do, we're going to take two minutes.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
If you've been on this call so far,

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
we've got 74 people stay on for like four minutes because we're going to be

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
giving away these Apple AirPods. Um, we don't, we're not,

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
it's not one of those fixed ones. We've got somebody in mind.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
We're going to try and fix this thing. Why are you here?

56:52.000 --> 56:57.000
Why do you want to build a rank and rent empire like Ryan and I have done?

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
And again, it's, it's amazing. We started out with this idea.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Ryan's scale up to 87,000 a month.

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
I was able to scale up to a hundred and haven't looked back. Uh,

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
and we are, we had our wives.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
My wife was I wanted to be able to travel the world and make money for my

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
laptop and give my family and myself experiences that I never got.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
And that, that no one got like most people did it. And, uh,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
that's what I'm doing. I'm literally in Dubai right now.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
I've been able to move my family to Africa twice.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
I've been able to literally do exactly what I set out to do.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
That was my wife.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
And it just, for some reason,

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
I wanted to scratch that itch and it's still not completely scratched

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
because I'm still on it, but everyone's is different.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
So we're going to go through. You got one minute. Why?

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
And we're not going to go off with length, but if you, if it's lengthy,

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
that's fine. Why are you here?

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Why do you want to build a rank and rent agency?

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Let's see what we got. Okay.

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
Uh,

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
let's see, by the way,

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
I do see some additional questions for the tool.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
As soon as we announced this winner,

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
we're going to spend about five to seven minutes answering a couple more

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
questions. So we just want to let everybody that needs to get off,

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
hop off. Okay.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Okay.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Let's see.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Where are we at?

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
Dude, we got a lot of comments going here.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
I love this, man.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
We're getting rapid fire. This fires me up.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
I know, dude. I love it.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Uh, okay. Eric, it's 3 45 a.m.

58:23.000 --> 58:27.000
where I am setting alarm just to get all these amazing insights have to

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
work in three hours, but it's still worth it.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Dope shit. Scholarship would be awesome. Okay. Awesome.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Uh, Eric,

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Me too, bro. I went to bed at 2 a.m.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
4 30. My alarm went off and I, uh,

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
I even drove to this office space so I could.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
Make sure I could scream and not wake anybody else.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Um, let's see.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Where the hell are these?

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Why is that? We got a lot. Okay.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Wyatt says, why am I family of five?

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
Eating.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
Uh,

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
Uh, my wife has celiac is hella expensive.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
Okay.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
What else?

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
I'm investment banking.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
Hate my job, right?

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
And I'm going to let you kind of scan through those.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
Right.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I'm going to let you scan through those.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
I'm going to scan through those.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
I'm going to scan through those.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
I'm going to scan through those.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Right.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
I'm going to let you kind of scan through those really quick.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
I'm going to let you choose the winner.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
This is your show today, bro.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
I'm just,

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
I'm just the,

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
I'm just here,

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
the facilitator,

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
but this is your show.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
I'm going to let you kind of scan through.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
And what I want you to do,

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
I want to have you pick the top three.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
We're going to do the headphones for the top one.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
Uh,

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
and then I'll give away some swag to the other two.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
So at least we have the top three winners.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
You see three that you like.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
And give this away.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
All right.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
I got three.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
Boom.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
Go.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Who are you doing?

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
Read the answers.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
So I,

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
I like,

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
uh,

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
I like Eric getting up in the middle of the night.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
Cause he's got a dream.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Like I am all about that.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
I love that.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
That,

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
that fires me up.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Uh,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Wyatt,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
like if you've got medical things,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000
nothing makes a man hungrier than something medical in their family.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Right.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
I'm going to,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I'm going to solve this.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
My wife has,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
uh,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
gluten intolerance,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
right?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
She can't eat bread and stuff like that.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
It's not celiac,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
but,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
uh,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
that,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
that is,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
uh,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
that's the,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
you gotta,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
you gotta take serious for sure.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Cause she's gonna have problems later on in life.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I respect that a lot.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And then,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
uh,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Katie's talking about her daughters,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I think daughter,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
daughters,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
two of them.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I got a little girl and I do anything for my little girl.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
And so,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
uh,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
when you arrive home in the middle of the night,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
you got medical stuff to solve.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
You got,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
you know,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
little girl,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
like those are,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
those are the ones that pull on my heart.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
So those are my answers for those three.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
So,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
um,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I vote,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I didn't even see any of those answers because it was going too fast.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
But,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
um,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Let's,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
let's let everyone vote.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Who do you think out of those three winners?

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
We got Katie with her daughters.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
We got Eric.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.760
with Wakin' Up, and we've got Wyatt

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.260
with health issues inside the family.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.040
Real quick, who do you guys, let's let everybody vote.

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.900
Who's the winner out of the three?

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.560
Katie, Wyatt, Eric, just drop a name.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.480
Katie, Wyatt, Eric, we're gonna give,

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.080
who won the headphones, two, a couple of people,

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.280
pieces of swag, and then we're gonna get

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.120
a little bit more Q&A.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.120
What do we got here?

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.960
I'm seeing some Katie's popping in.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:33.700
Katie, Katie, Katie, Katie.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:38.200
Wyatt, Katie, because same girl.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.860
Gotta go, good stream, Katie.

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.000
I think it's Katie, dude.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:45.840
Yeah, there's a lot.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.140
Yeah, Katie's the winner.

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:48.500
Okay, Katie, you are the winner.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.400
What I'm gonna have you do, and by the way,

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.280
Wyatt, Wyatt and Eric, you guys are swag winners.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.520
I know that Eric was also looking at,

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.120
talking about a scholarship.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.720
Message me if you guys were interested in the scholarship.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.560
You guys can message me

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.360
with why you think you should win it.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:09.480
Katie, message, Aaron, and we will get you the,

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.720
either order the headphones directly to your location

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.120
or just Venmo you the money.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.600
You can do it for those headphones, but you enjoy those.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.480
Thanks for being on the stream.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.520
Eric, Wyatt, you guys are gonna win

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.000
the Digital Landlord t-shirts,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.560
and you'll get those shipped to your house as well, okay?

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:28.080
Beautiful.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.360
Yeah, Katie, Katie is the clear winner.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.700
I love that, and I appreciate you guys with your feedback.

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:36.000
So let's go, let's do seven minutes.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.840
We're gonna answer a couple more questions,

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.640
and then Ryan, let's hop off this call.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.160
But again, guys, I'm gonna type this one more time.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.800
If you didn't already, we've got a code,

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:49.800
LANDLORD24, if you guys want to get the promo,

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:53.800
that's gonna be good for at least 24 hours.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.540
Depending on how that goes, we might extend it.

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.980
We'll see, but let's go through a couple of questions

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.820
that we had from the actual software side, okay?

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:06.260
But guys, real quick, for those that were on this call,

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:07.700
just wanna say thank you.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:11.600
We had, I saw at one point, 97 people.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.500
That means a lot to us.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.820
We know you guys have a lot of stuff going on,

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:17.260
and we don't take that lightly.

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:21.940
So I think this was a really awesome call, lots of value.

01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:23.900
Got me pumped, it always does.

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.340
Every time I'm on with Ryan, I get pumped,

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.700
but we just appreciate you guys being on the call.

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:31.380
So just wanted to say that really quick.

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.640
For sure, yeah.

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:37.500
Let's see, let's go through a couple of questions real quick.

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:41.700
Kurt Dahlstrom has the best question.

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:43.220
He says, one question you have to ask yourself,

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.340
Amex or Visa?

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:47.500
Yeah, assume the close.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.200
I love that, okay.

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:53.620
Okay, let's go.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:56.700
Justin Taylor says, will there be any form trackers as well,

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:57.980
or just phone calls only?

01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:59.340
I think right now it's just phone calls,

01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.380
but eventually, is there gonna be form trackers?

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.540
Is that something on the list?

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:05.100
Is it not on the list?

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:08.500
Yeah, so we do forms, and then we have a lead,

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.340
like a forum for inputting the leads,

01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.620
if you're the one answering the phone,

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.420
or if you're a VA, or setter, or however you wanna do it.

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:20.260
Piping in a form through a API call, or a webhook,

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:23.380
from a, like whatever one of your sites are.

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:24.980
Something that we wanna do.

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:28.060
It just is not something that is in this first version.

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:33.260
Keep in mind, guys, this is version 1.0.

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:35.700
There will be many, many versions to come,

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.580
but right now, I think for a version 1.0,

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:40.820
this thing is pretty darn robust, in my opinion.

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.180
Yeah, we worked really hard on it,

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:44.140
and the cool thing about this is,

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.780
you guys are help building this.

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:48.980
So this is something that, as we get feature requests,

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:50.780
this is not a done thing.

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.660
As we get feature requests,

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.180
we're gonna take those feature requests

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.260
that everybody's asking for,

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:56.900
and say, this is what we're building, right?

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.940
I have a call every week, with developer,

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.420
and you guys help build that vision,

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:04.180
because you say, hey, here's what we want,

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:07.220
and so it's still being built by the rank and rank community,

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:10.380
and it's still an ongoing thing

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.140
for development of this platform.

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:16.580
Anthem says, are the sub-users able to log in

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.780
with their own login, or do they use ours?

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.140
This is awesome.

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:22.100
Yes, yeah, they log in with their own.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.020
You can have your own sub-users.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.020
PJ asks, do we have a call tracking service,

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:26.860
or does this tool does that?

01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:28.700
Yeah, this does everything voice.

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.020
This is all programmed on auto.

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:35.060
You don't have to use CallRail or any of those others.

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.620
It's built all right in here together for you guys.

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:41.780
Dustin says, would you recommend this for someone

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:45.100
just starting out with a couple of sites and no deals yet,

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.620
or someone that has deals already?

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.540
I'm curious your answer on that, Ryan.

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:51.900
Yeah, absolutely, because even if you don't have

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.100
a deal yet, you still have to figure out

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.820
where you're gonna build your website.

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:57.940
You have to figure out which market you're gonna win in.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:59.780
You have to have a phone number

01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:01.460
that's gonna put on the website.

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:03.180
You gotta have the tools set up to succeed

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:05.340
once you can close that first business owner.

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.660
This is made for everyone from,

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:10.060
I'm just starting rank and rent today,

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:14.020
to I have an agency with 150 websites like I do.

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:18.140
And I think too, and the question also might be

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.220
a little deeper, basically asking like,

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:22.780
is it worth the money at this point?

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:27.020
And I think, look, I think the local plan's like 97 bucks

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:29.940
with that discount, you're at 70 bucks.

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.660
You have to use something anyway.

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:33.540
You're gonna have to use some kind of tool.

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:35.500
Semrush is 129.

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:39.460
That's just that tool.

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:42.740
But also, I always think about this in terms of time.

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.300
If you guys haven't done due diligence,

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.980
go do five due diligence and then come sign back up

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:51.180
for rank and rent engine because you guys are gonna wanna

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.900
literally poke needles in your eyes.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:55.020
It is tough.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:56.620
It is freaking tough.

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:57.700
It takes time.

01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.060
And from somebody that's literally done

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:01.980
over a thousand themselves, I swear to you,

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.900
that feature alone is worth 100 bucks a month.

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.220
Like easy for me.

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:10.220
Because I'm saving, dude, I'm saving 23 to 50 minutes.

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.980
I bet my first due diligence took me an hour.

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.220
So when you're first starting,

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:16.900
you're saving 50 minutes a rip.

01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:19.660
You do that for the first 10, 20.

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:20.500
Like what's your time?

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.980
Even if your time's only worth 10 bucks an hour,

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:25.140
which it's not, it's worth it just

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:26.220
with the due diligence feature,

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:28.500
which is I think my favorite feature about this thing.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.620
So yes, I think it's like that thing.

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:32.540
Like if you wanna make professional money,

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.820
you treat it professional.

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:37.180
However, if you are just completely broke,

01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:39.580
then obviously you can go and you can hobnob it together.

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:40.420
Yes.

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:42.900
But again, look at your time and what it's worth.

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:44.460
And sometimes we just forget about that.

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:45.820
So 100%.

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.220
Quick question, Casey Patton.

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:48.540
This is actually Kyle's brother.

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:49.380
Good question.

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.200
He says, can you create-

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.040
What's up, Casey?

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:51.880
I know Casey.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.700
Okay, dope.

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.140
He says, can you create recurring tasks?

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:56.180
Recurring tasks.

01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:59.580
So like you put in a task and you market it complete

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:01.180
and it comes back up like a month later.

01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:03.420
No, we don't have that right now, but that's a great idea.

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:05.700
So when you got it backed up,

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.140
yeah, join the Facebook group,

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.380
come to our Facebook group.

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.660
And then when you guys make an account,

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:12.980
you can actually click your little face up here

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:14.300
and you can click support

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:15.980
and you can put in a feature request.

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.740
So you just put in your feature request

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:20.140
and it goes straight into the same tool that I use

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:22.460
to work with my developers to build out that kind of thing.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:25.020
So that's exactly how the flow works

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:26.780
to get that kind of thing added in.

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:30.900
Dustin says, the task tracker reminds me of Trello

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:33.540
with the cam band board.

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.420
Yes, it also like a type drive.

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:38.700
It's so easy to create that card and just drag it over.

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:43.140
Like I used to use Asana and that was like, it was nice,

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:46.060
it was so much that it just overwhelmed me.

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.660
This is like a couple of columns, boom, boom, boom.

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.060
You're done.

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.900
Let's see, what else we got?

01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:54.020
Any other questions you see?

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:57.180
Let's answer like one or two more and we'll hop off, dude.

01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.420
For sure.

01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.580
More info.

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.660
So you guys should know this.

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:04.380
Don't sign up on mobile, it's made for desktop.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:05.780
So if you're trying to sign up on mobile,

01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:09.300
it's not gonna take you to a mobile version of this.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.340
One day maybe we'll have an app or something like that,

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:12.900
but it's designed for desktop.

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:15.100
So I got a question I think about

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:16.940
signed up on mobile earlier

01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:19.820
and it's just not built for that right now.

01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:22.820
So there's really no reason because, dude,

01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:24.860
I don't know about you, I'm not building sites on my mobile.

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:26.020
Like that's just.

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:27.100
Oh, no one is.

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:27.940
Yeah.

01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:29.620
So quick question, Landon says,

01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:31.500
what kind of spam filters do you offer?

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.300
And I know there's something out there.

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:38.020
So we've got under your tracking numbers,

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:39.860
we have built-in spam filtering.

01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:42.940
You can enable spam filtering

01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:46.900
and that requires them to press one to connect the call.

01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:48.820
So they'll have a message that says,

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.660
thank you for calling, press one to connect.

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:57.420
And the caller will have to actually input that

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:00.180
on their phone to connect the call, right?

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:03.580
So that's the number one thing I've used to reduce spam.

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:05.780
And you can just enable it by clicking with spam filtering

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:07.220
and update your phone number.

01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:09.020
Love it.

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:10.620
I like, dude, how simple this is.

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:12.980
I know that there's other tools that are,

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.540
they have a little bit of overlap.

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:18.300
And the frustrating thing for me was that there was so much

01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:21.300
because they're trying to cater to SMMA and SEO agencies

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.140
and all this stuff.

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:25.340
There was so much that like high level just made my,

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.860
I started the Twitch.

01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:31.500
It's so specific to rank and rent

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.660
that if you aren't in rank and rent,

01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:35.820
this stuff wouldn't really make sense,

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:38.380
which I think is the beauty behind it.

01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:40.580
Guys, this should show you how confident me and Ryan are

01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:41.420
in this fricking industry.

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:43.820
You know, everyone says, how saturated is this?

01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:48.820
Well, it's not saturated enough to discourage us from this.

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.900
Like this is literally built for rank and rent.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:54.740
So let's do one more.

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:57.300
Do we still need a call tracking service

01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.140
or does this call take care of that?

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:01.100
Does this tool take care of that?

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.020
Yeah, so all your calls here.

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.100
Excuse me.

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:07.940
What's up?

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:09.780
Can you hear me?

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:10.620
Yeah, I got you.

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:11.620
Okay, keep going, keep going.

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:12.460
My internet went out.

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:13.300
Keep going.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.980
I was ready to ride into the sunset, man.

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:15.820
I had it.

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:16.660
I had it going.

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:17.500
Sorry, bro.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.340
Sorry.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:21.260
I was gonna ride into the sunset.

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:22.100
All right, guys.

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:23.820
So the question is about call tracker.

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:25.820
This is all that you need for programmable voice

01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:26.660
and messaging.

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:30.180
So if you're in here, you could buy the phone numbers.

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:34.020
You can find a free number of phone numbers

01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.140
for your plan, right?

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:39.260
So if you want more than that, you can add phone numbers.

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:40.900
Your phone numbers are free.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:45.900
And then you set up your right here on the platform, right?

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:47.980
Where you can listen to call recordings.

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:52.220
You can add notes to the call to go and look at it.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:54.340
It's like important lead information.

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.820
All that's done right in here.

01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:57.780
You don't have to use any third party service

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:59.820
like CallRail or Twilio or whatever.

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:03.740
Buy numbers in the platform or that you wanna go into

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.580
and set them up.

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:06.420
One thing to note,

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:07.860
because I know this is gonna come up.

01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:10.300
You currently, at this version,

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:14.180
you cannot port numbers into this platform yet,

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:16.740
but that is definitely a high priority item.

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:17.580
Shit.

01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:18.420
Can you not hear me?

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:21.620
Wow.

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.440
That's crazy.

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.280
I think we lost you, Nick.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.120
Can you hear me now?

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:27.260
How about now?

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.100
How about now, Ryan?

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:38.740
If you guys have interest in having an API call being made

01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.380
like Zapier or something like that,

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:43.580
the data is already in the backend normalized.

01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:45.540
So it'd be easy to do that eventually,

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.580
but we don't have APIs connected in.

01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:48.700
Nick, what was your question, man?

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:49.540
Nick, what was your question?

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:50.380
I'm sorry.

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:51.220
I'm sorry.

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:52.040
I'm sorry.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:52.880
I'm sorry.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:53.700
I'm sorry.

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:54.540
I'm sorry.

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:55.380
I'm sorry.

01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:56.200
I'm sorry.

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.040
I'm sorry.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:57.880
What was your question, man?

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.960
We got your back.

01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.800
Sorry.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:01.640
We got lucky.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.560
Apparently, my WiFi's a little bit shoddy here,

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.560
but I was just letting them know

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:08.440
you cannot port numbers into the software currently,

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.920
but that is something that's a high priority item for us

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.000
to make sure that's implemented,

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.800
but you can buy numbers through the platform.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.760
Yeah, and you can bring in your own number here.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.460
You can select a tracking number or you can add one.

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:22.960
So you can enter your own tracking number right here

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:25.200
so that if you've got another voice system,

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.040
you've got some numbers on it,

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:26.880
it's no big deal.

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.640
Just come in here, put your number in,

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.640
and it's tied into your site portfolio.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.700
And there's no issue with that.

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:35.160
I've got sites that are like that,

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.280
that they aren't ported in yet.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.600
And we wanna make it to where you guys can port in

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.640
your numbers if you want to,

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.400
to get off whatever old platform that you're on.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.520
But in the meantime, you can just put those numbers

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.700
right into your site portfolio and tie it up

01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:48.160
with whatever site that you're working on.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:53.160
So would that mean it would still track the leads or no?

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.360
It wouldn't show up as the calls.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.280
It would just show what phone number is assigned

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.120
to which website right here on the platform,

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.320
even if it's like a third-party service.

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.160
For sure.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.480
And that is something, guys, we didn't want it.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:08.360
Again, it's like, let's just get this thing out.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.360
Rather than wait super long.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.120
I was like, Ryan, you should just push this thing out.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.380
So anyway, I think we've gone on long enough.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.600
All caps Landlord 24.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:22.080
That's the promo code, 20% off for the first two months.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.320
Got the community.

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.400
We gave away the swag.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.440
We've got the AirPod Max winners.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.800
And I think that is it.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.160
Ryan Dalton, thanks for being on the call, man.

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:34.360
Yeah, ARTA Digital Real Estate.

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:35.560
Great to be on here with you guys.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.600
Nick, thanks for having me on, man.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:37.560
I learned a lot from you.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.280
And I'm always deeply grateful for it.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.680
Guys, I'm born and raised.

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:45.160
The first group I ever found about this was,

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.840
it used to be called ARTA Pre-Selling.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.680
And it ain't that anymore.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.640
It's all grown up.

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.120
And so that's how I got started.

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.520
So I found this group.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.040
And two and a half years later,

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.080
here we are in different life, different world.

01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:58.920
I love it, man.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.040
Well, appreciate you being on.

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:01.640
And everyone go check out the tool.

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.960
I know for me, my agency,

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.360
it's the only tool that I'm using.

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.840
And it's the only tool that I'm gonna be using

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.680
from here on out.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.500
So thanks, Ryan.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.600
See you soon.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.600
Thanks. See you guys.
