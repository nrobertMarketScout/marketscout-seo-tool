1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
So my only concern is generating the leads right now.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,680
Well, so that's something that you can't really control.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,840
So what I would do is do everything that you can

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,920
to make sure that they're coming in.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,300
But don't, like a lot of you guys,

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,520
I think the leads aren't coming in.

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,160
You go and tweak something on Google,

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,120
like, oh, negative keywords, change the keywords,

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,960
change the budget.

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,920
I think every time you do that,

11
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,160
there's like this process, this period of time

12
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,400
that it has to like recalibrate.

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,440
Just leave the leads alone.

14
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,000
If you did it right the first time, just leave them alone.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,160
There's nothing else you can do.

16
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,440
And then what I would do is go do what Ashley did,

17
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,120
or not Ashley, it was Tara.

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,800
She was right there and she needed like one more lead.

19
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,980
She literally went on Facebook and found somebody

20
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,660
in that area on like a marketplace

21
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,200
that needed a recommendation,

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,320
direct messaged them and got an extra lead.

23
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,960
It was the very lead that she used to close the deal.

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,800
Nice.

25
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,640
That was very neat.

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
Like what city is this in?

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,980
Richmond.

28
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,160
So go to Richmond, buy, sell, trade, or whatever the group.

29
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,080
Richmond, there's like, you know,

30
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,720
these Facebook groups go in there

31
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,360
and just do smart searches like recommendation

32
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,200
or deck builder.

33
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,520
And there's going to be some posts

34
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,520
and nine times out of 10, you're going to find some,

35
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,720
it's like, hey, who knows a good deck builder,

36
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,280
message them, boom.

37
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,840
It didn't, you didn't come from Google,

38
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,840
but it's a lead is a lead is a lead is a lead.

39
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,360
And that's like a little hustle you got to do,

40
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,640
but that might be just what you need

41
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,840
to get it over the edge.
