Is it a good idea to start pitching before launching,

00:04.640 --> 00:05.800
being able to provide leads?

00:05.800 --> 00:06.640
Yeah, you can.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.240
If you want the practice, you can.

00:08.240 --> 00:11.720
I mean, I definitely think when you have a lead in hand,

00:11.720 --> 00:14.280
it's the way that you say things

00:14.280 --> 00:15.980
and the tone of your voice is different

00:15.980 --> 00:17.720
because you actually have a lead.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.440
You have the address.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.840
You have the business, the customer's name.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.160
You know the scope of work.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.920
So I think it's more effective,

00:24.920 --> 00:29.360
but have I gotten deals where we've done that?

00:29.680 --> 00:32.280
And Lincoln, he helped me with some setting

00:32.280 --> 00:35.760
a couple years ago, and we started doing that

00:35.760 --> 00:36.600
and it worked.

00:37.520 --> 00:41.760
So yeah, you can, but it's definitely more effective

00:41.760 --> 00:44.220
if you have a lead in hand, just in my opinion.
