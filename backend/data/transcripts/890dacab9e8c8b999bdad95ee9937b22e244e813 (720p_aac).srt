1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
The first thing I want to tell you guys and you need to remember this and I will write this on here

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,600
And make sure it's on the printout on the actual script

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,000
Guys this you need to realize that you you don't want this to be high pressure. Okay?

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,800
People get scared of high pressure

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,840
They hate it. They hate it. They hate it

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,480
So you do not want them to be scared of like you don't want them to as soon as they feel pressure

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,040
They're gonna they're gonna bounce they're gonna ghost you they're gonna think of a reason like they're not even gonna be paying attention

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,360
They're just going to be thinking of a reason why they can how they can get you off their screen. I'm not kidding

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,280
so

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,480
The couple calls i've been on recently what i've heard is

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,520
Guys, I definitely think it's important to let them know. Hey, please don't leave me in

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,400
I don't know zone make sure that like just give me a yes or no

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,240
but some of you guys are saying that in such a way that it's scaring people off like

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,960
There's a couple ways to say that and you don't need to say hey just just to confirm

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,000
You will give me a yes or no by the end of this, correct? Like

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,880
That's just adding pressure that doesn't need to be added in a different way of saying that it would be like

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,560
Hey, like I told you the only thing I ask is just don't leave me in. I don't know zone. That's all I ask

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,640
Okay, i've given you enough references and everything else by the end of this. This is a good fit

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,040
Let's move forward if it's not then let's not but that's my only ask. Is that fair?

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,560
Those are completely different. One of them is giving a ton of pressure. Oh shit. He's gonna like

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,680
Crap, how do I get this guy off the call? I don't want to I don't want to have to go into this high pressure situation

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,360
so guys

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
Take the pressure off the call

24
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,040
Take the pressure off of the customer because that is not going to help you that is not something that helps you get the deal

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,520
Okay, even though at the end you're going to ask for the deal and if needed we're going to apply a little pressure

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,480
We don't want the whole call them to be thinking about that close and thinking about how do I get them off the call?

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,080
so so

28
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,760
Take off the pressure. Okay number one and I just want you to be thinking about that the whole time

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,520
and and it's kind of like even like um, I know like with ryan even it's like it's and and and

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,120
Mahmood's been doing this on his calls like my whole sales pitch is like hey if this makes sense great

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,760
If not, no harm, no foul if not, no big deal

32
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,480
I'm repeating these phrases because I want this to seem like no big deal even though deep down

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
This is a huge deal for me
