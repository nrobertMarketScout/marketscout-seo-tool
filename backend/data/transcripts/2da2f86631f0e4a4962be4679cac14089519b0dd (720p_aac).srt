1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Beautiful, all right, Ryan Dalton.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,260
So guys, real quick before we get into this call, which by the way, we're gonna be talking

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,260
about 2025.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:16,140
We're gonna be talking about how to, I called this stream, this live is how to gear up for

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,140
the best year of your life.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:24,540
And I wanted to have, you know, I mean, arguably, not arguably, I think hands down out of anybody

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:36,580
in this, not even, I think, I know, hands down without a doubt, 2024 was your year,

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,580
man.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,540
Yeah, 2024 was a great year.

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,820
Yeah, I mean, 2023 had a great year, but 2024, you did some incredible things, which we're

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,820
gonna get into.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,140
But real quick, I just wanted to make one quick announcement.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,460
By the way, Jahil, what's going on?

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,620
One quick announcement, guys, is we talked about this, I kind of alluded to this, I think

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,580
it was last week, but we are constantly, you know, listening to feedback from you guys

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,820
on Rankin' Ren Engine as you guys, if any of you guys have no idea what we're talking

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,180
about, rankinrenengine.com, that's the only tool you need for this business.

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,580
We listen to the feedback.

19
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,340
My team gives it to Ryan, and I know that you guys are giving it and we're listening.

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,220
Obviously, there's people in other countries that those are things that we're gonna be

21
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,220
rolling out.

22
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:38,020
But one of the, I think, only things that was left on the tool was the backlinking piece.

23
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,740
And the nice part is it still, you know, when you do the due diligence on Rankin' Ren Engine,

24
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,100
you can still see the backlinks, it still gives you data.

25
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,100
When Ryan and I discussed, I'm like, if we could go a little deeper to have something

26
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,340
similar to like a man ghouls, where we could not just see the backlinks so we could look

27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,140
at the backlink profile, see the referring domains, I think this thing would be the most

28
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,340
complete tool out there for Rankin' Ren.

29
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,220
So Ryan, can you give us some kind of update in terms of that, I know you told me, but

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:12,060
just for everybody else, when we can expect kind of that rollout, a conservative estimate

31
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,380
on when we can expect that feature to be added?

32
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,180
Yeah, for sure.

33
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,420
Yeah, so I think in the next conservatively, in the next 30 days, we got the holidays coming

34
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,060
up.

35
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,860
So that's gonna make things a little bit slower than normal.

36
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,420
But all the data is there, actually.

37
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,700
So we have all the data to create that.

38
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,340
Right now, we're just making everything look real pretty on the front end so that when

39
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:43,020
you actually use that part of the tool, it looks pretty, which I'm a big believer in.

40
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,500
So we'll have that rollout pretty soon.

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,260
And people want to be able to do copycat backlinks and know where they're comparing backlinks

42
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:51,820
and all that.

43
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,220
So that's an easy addition.

44
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,180
Beautiful.

45
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,340
And by the way, there's going to be a few people because I do see some people that have

46
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,060
joined in the last week, copycat backlinking.

47
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,180
Well, let me just even go a little bit deeper and go very basic.

48
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,220
Backlinking is, I would call it, kind of like a steroid to get your website ranked.

49
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,140
If, you know, there are times when you don't have to backlink.

50
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,860
If you go into a very, very easy city and niche, you do really good content, you do

51
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,020
everything else very sound, I have ranked websites without any backlinks.

52
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,940
But when your website gets stuck on page two, bottom of page one, or you just want to speed

53
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,900
things up, backlinking is a steroid.

54
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,660
It is a way to get the website kind of out of that rut and get it to the top of page

55
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:39,980
one.

56
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:47,900
But essentially, maybe, I know this is very basic for some people, but maybe, Ryan, in

57
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,940
30 seconds, for those that there's a few people I know that are brand new to online, to SEO,

58
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,860
what is backlinking?

59
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,940
Just so everybody knows what the heck we're talking about.

60
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,420
It's not that complicated, but it sounds complicated.

61
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:05,660
Yeah, a backlink is any time that your website is referenced somewhere else on the internet,

62
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:12,060
basically, and Google will rank based on what they call their EAT, acronym, expertise,

63
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,580
authoritativeness, and trustliness.

64
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,660
And one of the things they look for is all these different signals to see if your website

65
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,700
meets their standard for ranking, right?

66
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:28,460
Ultimately, they're trying to decide, is the website, are the websites that they're returning

67
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,020
the search results answering the searcher's question?

68
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,140
And the websites that have the highest expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness

69
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,860
are going to answer the question better than ones that don't.

70
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,460
So to find that, they look at all these different signals.

71
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,580
And one of the key ones, one of the most important ones is backlinks, which are basically

72
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,260
just a popular contest.

73
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:57,660
It's other websites saying your website answers those questions about whatever that is, like

74
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,780
a keyword, like concrete contractor, right?

75
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,060
Other websites are talking about you as the concrete contractor and pointing to your URL

76
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,260
from their website.

77
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,900
That signals to Google, hey, this guy probably knows what he's doing with concrete.

78
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,060
And then you rank higher than your competitors.

79
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:15,920
That's it.

80
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,780
Remember that, guys, the popularity contest.

81
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,340
It's just like, I always think about like high school or your friends or whatever.

82
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,700
It's like who you hang around is who people assume you are, right?

83
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,780
So the way that you hang around people on the internet is people refer to you.

84
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,540
People send you a backlink.

85
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:42,380
And so, for example, let's just say, and it's kind of like a status thing, like Forbes.

86
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:49,980
Forbes would have more status than any mommy blog or construction blog or whatever.

87
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,820
So if Forbes gave me a backlink, they're telling Google, hey, Google, I have a lot

88
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,780
of status.

89
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:01,340
And this website, BentonvilleConcrete.com, I'm basically giving them my approval.

90
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,740
And so then Google's looking at it going, OK, well, if Forbes says that, then they must

91
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,100
have some status.

92
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,860
And so it's basically this game of just getting people to link to you.

93
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,660
And there are strategies.

94
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,300
But one of the most common is called the copycat method.

95
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,780
All it is is looking at other people that are winning, other people that are ranking,

96
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,180
finding where they're getting backlinks, and just going and copycatting and doing the exact

97
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,340
same.

98
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,820
And so what we're saying to wrap all this up is this tool is going to allow you to go

99
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,700
find those links and to be able to go and harvest them yourself.

100
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,700
So it sounds like a lot.

101
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,620
When I first got started, again, let's remember, I didn't know how to build a website.

102
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,060
I didn't know what a domain was.

103
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,740
And here we are talking about backlinks.

104
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,180
It's not that complicated.

105
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,540
So Gina says, I've been on a mission to figure out and set up backlinks for our sites.

106
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,580
I'm still trying to figure it out.

107
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,180
Yeah, it's really not that difficult.

108
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,780
So what we'll do, maybe when we roll that feature out officially, we'll go and do a

109
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,540
backlink training, just some basic one-on-one how to do backlinks.

110
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,940
But yeah, guys, if you haven't already, you can use any tool you want.

111
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,140
I know when I started, I was using a combination of seven different tools.

112
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,020
I had all kinds of different stuff that we had opened up.

113
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,700
I had even had a custom software built to track my paper lead stuff when I was doing

114
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,740
that, which I don't recommend.

115
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,700
But if you want to make it easy, go to RankinRentEngine.com, sign up for an account.

116
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,620
It's ridiculously affordable.

117
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,260
And we also have a code that...

118
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,780
Ryan, for anybody that hasn't already, let's just write that code in the chat real quick.

119
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,700
That's the one.

120
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,020
And that's 20% off for the first two months.

121
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,460
Yeah, I think I've got a bunch of codes.

122
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,180
I think that's the one that has that one.

123
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,580
So I can confirm that after the call.

124
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,820
But yeah, I think it's 20% off for two months.

125
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,700
Beautiful.

126
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,980
So guys, go check it out.

127
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,420
It's the only tool that we're using.

128
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,460
It makes due diligence so much faster.

129
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,740
Anyway, there's a million different things.

130
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,700
That's not what this call is about.

131
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,460
But just wanted to give a quick little plug for that and know that the backlinkings coming out.

132
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,820
So move your stuff over.

133
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,700
You can buy your phone.

134
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,620
How much are your phone numbers through RankinRentEngine?

135
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,740
Yeah, it depends on how you do it.

136
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,780
So you could get additional, add additional sites.

137
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,060
And if you add additional sites, the number comes free with it.

138
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,300
Otherwise, they're $2.50 a month.

139
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,300
Which is half the price.

140
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,220
$2.50, right?

141
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,940
Yeah.

142
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,940
And I think on CallRail, even if you do...

143
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,580
Even me, I've got a bunch of numbers because I'm moving my stuff over still.

144
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,900
I think the cheapest I ever got them was like five bucks a number.

145
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,620
I could be wrong.

146
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,700
But that's very, very cheap.

147
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,980
One of the things I realized about some of these other platforms is that they're

148
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:53,500
like, they've got like different tiers that are kind of confusing versus like your

149
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,300
programmable voice is add-on, your CRM is add-on.

150
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,980
Look at some of these other competitors.

151
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,100
And it just signals to me that it's just not made for RankinRent.

152
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:07,500
It's made for like different marketing strategies or tools or whatever you're trying to do.

153
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,220
But for RankinRent, it needs to be just pretty straightforward.

154
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,020
Like you have to have programmable voice and messaging.

155
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,980
So it's baked right in.

156
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,580
Yep, yep.

157
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,180
No, it's slick, man.

158
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,540
It's super simple.

159
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,860
So, okay, guys, that said, real quick, Jahil says, Ryan, quick question.

160
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,940
I don't know if this is already in the works, but if it's possible,

161
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,460
will there be a tracker in Rare that shows how many keywords someone here,

162
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,700
someone has remaining for the day?

163
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,220
Kind of similar to Mangools.

164
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,420
Let me shut my door.

165
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:35,900
Totally.

166
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,060
Yeah.

167
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,260
So that exists now.

168
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,700
So if in the top right, you click on your profile and then you click on the usage tab,

169
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,300
you can see daily keyword lookups remaining.

170
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,180
And so your plan will determine how many that number is.

171
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,260
But you can go in there and you can see for today how many lookups remain.

172
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,340
You can also see your site lookups remaining.

173
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,100
And those are really just basically API limitations

174
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,260
to not spam the API at the end of the day for looking those up.

175
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:13,740
But you can look at all your usage statuses under your profile on the usage tab.

176
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:15,900
There you go.

177
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,820
Hopefully that answered your question, Mr. Jahil.

178
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,700
So let's get into this call, guys.

179
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,060
It's December 17th.

180
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,820
We have literally like two weeks to the day, like two weeks in a day, right?

181
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,500
Yeah.

182
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,780
It's almost over, man.

183
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,900
Quarter four is almost done.

184
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,340
That's crazy.

185
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,420
I say this every year, dude.

186
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,940
But it's like it feels like I just set my goals for 2024.

187
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,060
Yeah.

188
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,380
And here we freaking are.

189
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:42,860
Okay.

190
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,980
So let's talk about it, dude.

191
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,380
I want to...

192
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:55,900
So in 2024, Ryan, where were you at when 2024 started in terms of revenue?

193
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,100
I will tell you right now.

194
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,340
So January is a little bit weird because I did like trial or like discount rates for people,

195
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,100
like in some areas in the winter.

196
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,860
But I started...

197
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,300
Yeah.

198
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,020
So I came in at 2024 around $37,000 a month.

199
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,220
Okay.

200
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,160
Yeah.

201
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,220
$38,000.

202
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,500
I'm looking at my spreadsheet right now.

203
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,180
$38,000 at the start of 2024.

204
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,480
Okay.

205
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,260
$37,000, $38,000 started 2024.

206
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,420
And so, guys, let's keep in mind, Ryan, still...

207
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,220
Up until, was it like a week and a half or two weeks ago, you had a full-time job?

208
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,860
Still do.

209
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,020
Through the 31st or the 50th year.

210
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,980
I'm still got it.

211
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,780
I'm done.

212
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,340
Yeah.

213
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,300
He's done after this.

214
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,060
Two more weeks, but he's done.

215
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,820
So he has a full-time job, which I still can't comprehend.

216
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,700
He's got kids.

217
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,820
He's got a wife.

218
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,700
And he also does jujitsu.

219
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,980
He's got a dog.

220
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,820
He throws parties at his house.

221
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,300
Not ragers, but like he brings his friends over.

222
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,900
Like he has a million things going on, right?

223
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,340
I'm sure you have a Christmas party because I know you do a 4th of July party.

224
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,220
Yeah.

225
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,300
So my friend group has, like everyone kind of does one of the parties.

226
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,500
Mine are the summer ones.

227
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,140
I've got Memorial Day, July 4th, and Labor Day.

228
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,180
So they're the best ones.

229
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:15,980
They're the best ones.

230
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,540
Let's be honest.

231
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,540
Yeah, for sure.

232
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,100
So, okay, so let's just think about this.

233
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,860
So in the last 11 and a half months, you've added $50,000 of revenue per month, right?

234
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,420
So you're around, what are you at, 87, 88?

235
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,700
Yeah, I'm at when I've got a couple of people, their own discount rates,

236
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,980
but when they come off of those, I'll be at 89.5.

237
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:41,740
Okay.

238
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,060
I'm just, you just gave me a thought.

239
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,100
So I want to write it down.

240
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,740
89.5.

241
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,500
So I added $50,000 of revenue while having a full-time job.

242
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,180
And the most impressive part is on top of that, you also built rank and run engine.

243
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:00,940
Yeah.

244
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:07,100
Which, of course, he hired developers, but he was very tightly project managing that entire thing.

245
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,740
And so as I sat here and I'm thinking about New Year's, or the New Year,

246
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,780
I'm thinking about 2025.

247
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,460
I'm thinking about all these things I want to accomplish.

248
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:21,980
I'm like, what better person to have on than the person that had the best year out of anybody,

249
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,580
not only in my group, but in the free group, not only in this group, but in the free group,

250
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,860
but of, I would say any of the people that I know.

251
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,220
So I want to talk about that, dude.

252
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,300
I want to know, let's reverse engineer.

253
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,300
What did you do that made such a difference from the year before,

254
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,060
which you had a phenomenal year the year before?

255
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,900
And guys, for those that are new, like some of you guys that are, reach your first call.

256
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,340
Ryan, two, was it about two years ago?

257
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,140
When did you start this?

258
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,460
I'm going into my third year.

259
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,900
That's crazy.

260
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,900
Two years ago, I didn't know what this was.

261
00:13:52,700 --> 00:14:00,300
Yeah, so 2022 February was the first time that I turned on a Google ad.

262
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,020
I'm not crazy.

263
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,580
It's wild.

264
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,220
And it's inspiring because that's the possibilities of what's possible.

265
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,140
So two years ago, he didn't even know what this was.

266
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:19,900
Now he's at $87,000, $89,000 a month, built a tool that's phenomenal for this space.

267
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,300
I think it's the best tool out there already.

268
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,340
It's going to be hands down the best tool once he had a few more features

269
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,300
and done all this while having a family, while having a job.

270
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,540
And I just want to know, dude.

271
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,740
So I basically with this, I just want to, what did you do?

272
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,780
How did you start the year?

273
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,420
How did you gear up for 2025?

274
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,380
What was your mindset?

275
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,500
What was your planning?

276
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,540
What was your, did you get rid of a bunch of unnecessary things?

277
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,460
How did you manage all of this?

278
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,900
So I mean, that was like five questions, but we could start with one of them.

279
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,940
So let's get down.

280
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,420
I love the mindset stuff, man.

281
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,380
Like the mindset, I know some people think it's cheesy and they're like,

282
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,900
oh, I'll talk about mindset again.

283
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:06,060
But I am a, I'm just a huge believer in this business model.

284
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,900
And it doesn't, I was telling my wife this other day, it doesn't feel like work to me.

285
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,660
Like that's, I think one of the biggest differences, like people like, oh, like,

286
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,020
you know, you're up at nine o'clock at night, like working on something.

287
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,460
It doesn't feel like work.

288
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,540
It feels like play to me.

289
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,460
Like when I'm figuring out how to grow, how to expand, how to do the next thing,

290
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,420
it doesn't feel like work.

291
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,220
And I have like pretty good work-life balance.

292
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,900
So I'm not always trying to like, you know, be in front of a computer,

293
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,820
but when I am in front of a computer, it feels like something I really enjoy.

294
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,660
And the other part of it is, is that I think the AI is going to change our future

295
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,260
quite drastically.

296
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:49,500
And I think that the trades, the services that we help enable

297
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,620
through the lead that we provide are not going anywhere.

298
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,340
And my guess is they're probably going to be the last to be impacted.

299
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,300
Like, how are you going to have a robot put in a concrete driveway?

300
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,100
You know what I'm saying?

301
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,460
So like, I am thinking way forward because I work in tech, you know,

302
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,940
I've worked in tech for years and I know that there's a lot of jobs

303
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,860
that are just like all coming on the chopping block.

304
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,340
But I don't think that the trades are anywhere near in jeopardy of that.

305
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,220
Like think about it, right?

306
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,100
Like you're going to have a brick mason that's going to be replaced by a robot.

307
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,740
No, or a concrete guy, or none of the trades, the roofer or whatever,

308
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,500
are going to be, I think, in the near term impacted by AI.

309
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,220
And so I'm trying to align myself and my company and my finances

310
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:40,300
and my vision for things that are enduring and lead generation for tradespeople

311
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,860
is, I think, a really, really safe, safe move.

312
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,580
And so I want to grow a business that is future proofed.

313
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,640
Yeah.

314
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,500
So, and that's one of the things when I started this business,

315
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,340
there was a lot of different factors that were, you know, important to me,

316
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,180
scalability, recurring, all those different things.

317
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:07,100
But I didn't even really consider that piece or the piece that

318
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,980
this is a pretty recession resistant industry, right?

319
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,860
Obviously, we've all probably talked to our business owners,

320
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,660
like I had a business owner during the elections,

321
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,780
and right before that, he kind of got a little shaky on me.

322
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,980
I don't know if people are still buying, and by the way, he's still with us.

323
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,100
Now that the elections are over, I think it was all in his head.

324
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,260
Now he's like, people are finally starting to buy again.

325
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,900
Maybe not, but he's good now.

326
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,340
But outside of that, dude, we really didn't have,

327
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,420
like I don't think we had any cancellations, nothing that was directly tied to that.

328
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,620
But I didn't think about the fact that this is very recession resistant,

329
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,260
a business, a very recession resistant business.

330
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,100
And I've also a very, it has a lot of longevity because it's just a very,

331
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,140
guys, I think you probably realize this too, Ryan,

332
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,420
but like the more I'm in business and just in life in general,

333
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,500
the more I'm attracted to stuff that's simple, right?

334
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,140
Simple scales, simple is sexy.

335
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,740
It's like all these complex things I don't want anything to do with.

336
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,180
And this is such a simple business model that it just makes sense.

337
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,740
So going back to the mindset stuff, is there anything that you can give us?

338
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Like, what do you do?

339
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,420
How did you prepare and how did that have to do with your year in 2024?

340
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,620
And what advice would you give anyone that's on this call

341
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,660
for how to get their mind right going into 2025?

342
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,380
Yeah, so I agree with you about the simple stuff.

343
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,620
I just, I got the chat over here on the left.

344
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,940
I think Tim asked a question about AI chat bots.

345
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,340
And this kind of goes with my answer to this question is that

346
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,860
I think that there are a lot of ways to try to improve your agency

347
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,620
that feel like you're improving your agency, but you're just getting distracted.

348
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:03,580
So what I try to avoid is things that are going to become a problem at scale.

349
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,900
And so that means, you know, like if there's some plugin that looks cool,

350
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,180
or if there's some AI chat bot, or if there's, you know,

351
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,020
whatever there is the thing that people are testing out

352
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,700
and kind of the SEO world or whatever.

353
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,060
Generally, I found those are distractions is that rarely do I find something

354
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,380
that is so valuable, I will bake it into my agency from the top to bottom.

355
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,500
And I will, if I'm not careful, I'm prone to this.

356
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,700
I'm super prone to this.

357
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:37,580
I will catch myself testing lots of different little things that are just time sucks,

358
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,900
that are creating complexity in my agency instead of simplicity.

359
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,100
Like I'm always thinking about how to make it simpler, actually.

360
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,300
So if I'm putting my time into something, it's not adding complexity.

361
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,820
It's reducing it in some areas, whether that's, you know,

362
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,740
automations or like tying things together with like the finance stuff on the back end

363
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,580
or those kinds of things, making it simpler rather than more complex.

364
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,020
And sometimes maybe AI chat bots will actually make it simpler for you

365
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,140
because you're able to get leads to a business owner

366
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,820
in a way that is actually more streamlined, valid.

367
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,220
But I'm always trying to think about how to simplify.

368
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,820
Even at my current run rate, I'm thinking about how to make my agency simpler

369
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,940
and just smoother in its operations.

370
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:36,060
Yeah. Yeah, and it's also, I feel like when you first start out,

371
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,860
it's always about addition and how, what do I need to add?

372
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,220
What do I need to start doing?

373
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,300
And then you realize it's more about what, it's about subtraction.

374
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,580
What in this next year can I get rid of in my business

375
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,700
and in my processes and my systems in my life

376
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,060
so I can just focus on one single thing?

377
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:01,180
And so that was a huge thing for me when I had my biggest year in terms of like growth

378
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:07,740
when 2020 from 8 to 10,000 up to 100,000, that was a year of simplicity.

379
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,380
And it was getting rid of a lot of distractions,

380
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,740
getting rid of a lot of little micro businesses inside the business,

381
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,900
selling the SEO, selling this service, that service, consulting,

382
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,820
focusing on a bunch of different niches,

383
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,020
trying a bunch of different strategies to onboard customers.

384
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,460
And it was just, I was just cutting stuff, cutting stuff, cutting stuff.

385
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,380
And I would just wake up, same thing.

386
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,820
Get a new area, two areas, put up some ads, go do a deal.

387
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,780
And that was it, man.

388
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,740
And that's how I scaled.

389
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,020
And it was so easy.

390
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,660
It wasn't easy.

391
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,380
It was just mentally, I had a lot of clarity.

392
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:47,340
So for you mindset-wise, are there, are you somebody that does like,

393
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,380
what do you do for that?

394
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,340
Is it reading?

395
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,020
Is it talking to certain people?

396
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,340
Is it listening to certain things?

397
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,180
Like, what do you do to gear up that way?

398
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,580
Yeah, it's, I read a lot.

399
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,460
I got this book.

400
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,940
It's called Blitz Scaling.

401
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,820
Have you read this?

402
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,180
I've never even heard of that book.

403
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,660
It looks interesting.

404
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,180
It's the founder of, the co-founder of LinkedIn.

405
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,660
He's a partner at a firm called Greylock Partners.

406
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,140
Yeah, Greylock's is venture capital, right?

407
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:25,580
And the tagline is the lightning fast path to building massively valuable companies.

408
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,100
Interesting.

409
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,540
And I was like, I can't read this.

410
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,900
That I got to read that.

411
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,540
So I'm reading it.

412
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:37,420
Like one of his big ideas is that you have to, well, you don't have to,

413
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,700
but he talks about growing to optimize for speed,

414
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,700
which you talk about all the time over efficiency.

415
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,820
And the idea is, is you'll figure out the efficiency later.

416
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,660
And so my inclination is towards efficiency,

417
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,020
where I want to have everything like buttoned up, like as I grow.

418
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,500
And so it means my growth is kind of like this.

419
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,460
Whereas if you focus on speed, you'll figure out the inefficiencies later on.

420
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,300
You'll figure out like the, which is more your style, right?

421
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,220
Which is more like you'll grow and then like you'll figure out the pieces

422
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,940
that you got to figure out to make it real smooth.

423
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,860
And so this book has really challenged my mindset.

424
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,740
So I like to read.

425
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,460
I like to read stuff.

426
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,380
Okay. By the way, is that Reid Hoffman?

427
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,740
Yeah. Reid Hoffman and Chris Yeh are the co-authors.

428
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,340
Interesting guy. I like that guy.

429
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,620
It's a good read.

430
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,620
So give us three recommended books for mindset going into this year.

431
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,700
And guys, again, also just as for the person that's going to go and be like,

432
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,700
well, I'm going to go read for eight hours today,

433
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,540
because that's what Warren Buffett does.

434
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,620
No, that's just things to read.

435
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,540
I'm sure Ryan probably reads 10 pages to 30 minutes a day.

436
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,780
He probably doesn't sit and read for three hours.

437
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,340
So let's not go too extreme here.

438
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,460
But anyway, give us three recommended books on mindset that have really helped you.

439
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,980
Three books on mindset that helped me.

440
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,380
The three that come to mind are

441
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,540
Humilitas.

442
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,220
The theory behind Humilitas is the big idea with each book.

443
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,060
And you can decide if you're interested.

444
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,900
Humilitas is the idea that one of the missing things for success in life

445
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,460
is the combination of steely grit and humility.

446
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,460
Those two things are like what drives some of the most successful people in the world.

447
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,420
Great book.

448
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,620
Another is Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.

449
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,740
You can see where my shoulder.

450
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,700
See that guy right there?

451
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,420
See the bust of the dude behind me?

452
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,220
Is that Meditations?

453
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,100
Yeah, boy.

454
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,940
Yeah, of course.

455
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,500
Yeah, dude.

456
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,780
That's the good stuff.

457
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,140
You got it on your desk.

458
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,540
All right.

459
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,060
Yeah, man.

460
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,580
Meditations is the big idea.

461
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,020
It's the Stoic principles.

462
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,540
It's a little bit, it's philosophy, but the ideas in it are really good for business.

463
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,860
I went through Y Combinator.

464
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,980
And one of the things that Y Combinator said when they look for a founder

465
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,900
is they want someone who a bomb can go off.

466
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,180
And they just look at it.

467
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,100
And they're like, huh, a bomb went off.

468
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,700
And they go back to solving problems.

469
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,380
Like whatever the problems that bomb caused.

470
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,380
Like the James Bond kind of idea, right?

471
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,780
Meditations is the operating system for the mind, right?

472
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,940
Your brain, like a computer, needs an operating system.

473
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,420
And if you don't have an operating system,

474
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,980
it means that you're just sort of a kind of a mess, right?

475
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,780
So having a deliberately created operating system for your brain

476
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,300
is the purpose of philosophy.

477
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,620
And Meditations is great for business

478
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,500
because there are no shortage of problems in business.

479
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,580
For example, if I've got a business owner

480
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,380
who I'm killing it for, and I'm getting 80 liens a month,

481
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,140
and he calls me and he cancels

482
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,500
because he is getting tons of commercial job

483
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,060
that I helped him get, right?

484
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,820
I helped him get all that commercial work

485
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,420
and now he's not interested in my 80% residential leads, right?

486
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,540
He's canceling on me.

487
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,420
That is completely outside of my control.

488
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,100
I have no control over that.

489
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,460
And so when I get upset about it, no, right?

490
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,860
I shouldn't anyway, right?

491
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,660
It's out of my control.

492
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,020
Why should I get upset about it?

493
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,300
That's one of the big concepts in Meditations

494
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,140
is it teaches your brain to be like,

495
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,740
oh, this problem happened.

496
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,220
Huh, okay, I'm gonna go solve it, right?

497
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:34,780
It's really good.

498
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,220
And then the third one was

499
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,900
Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss.

500
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,060
The art of negotiation, persuasion, empathy, and active listening.

501
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,060
All three great for business.

502
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,100
Beautiful.

503
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,380
So I've linked up two.

504
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,660
I'm gonna link up this last one

505
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,220
so everyone can have an easy way.

506
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:59,100
By the way, there is no affiliate here.

507
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,940
I just went to Amazon to type these in.

508
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,740
I wish there was an affiliate for books.

509
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,980
I need a bigger audience to get an affiliate for.

510
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,820
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

511
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,620
It would be nice.

512
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,500
So those are the three that Ryan recommends, guys.

513
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,100
Humilitas, Meditations, and Never Split the Difference.

514
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,380
I've never even heard of the first one.

515
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,180
I've heard of the other two, obviously, but that's awesome.

516
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,020
Okay, so now tell us like, how did you set your,

517
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:28,220
what was your goal setting that process like about a year ago?

518
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,500
I guess it would have been December 2023

519
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,420
as you're gearing up for 2024.

520
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,460
What was that like, dude?

521
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,940
Yeah, this is an area that I am not very good at actually,

522
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,380
and I need to do it for this year.

523
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:48,060
I'm really good at committing today to what I need is required

524
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,620
and what will take to move the needle today.

525
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,140
Like that's my strength.

526
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,500
My weakness is I'm not good at setting a goal

527
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,300
and backward planning with key performance indicators.

528
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,580
I do this in my job, or I did in my job.

529
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,020
I don't know why I didn't do it in my agency.

530
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,620
It's weird, like a mental thing.

531
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,900
So I wouldn't say that I sat down in December of last year

532
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,420
and like planned out this year.

533
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,660
The thing that I did in December though,

534
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,580
is I realized I had like pretty significant chunk of time

535
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,180
under my belt of like really knowing

536
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,780
how to do this business model.

537
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,260
And then realizing that going into next year,

538
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,020
I need to be aggressive.

539
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,140
And I invested, I reinvested back into my agency

540
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,900
a significant amount of money

541
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,420
that I could have taken as profit,

542
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,260
that I just dumped back in.

543
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,500
And I attribute a lot of that to my growth.

544
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,860
So when you started the year, you didn't have in mind,

545
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,260
hey, I want to hit this revenue number or anything like that?

546
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,980
No, that's what's easy.

547
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,580
Bad at that kind of thing.

548
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,740
It's an air of opportunity for me for sure.

549
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,700
That's crazy, bro.

550
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,140
So you didn't have any idea,

551
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,140
in the back of your mind, did you say, hey,

552
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,580
like obviously you didn't sit down and write it down,

553
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,500
but in the back of your mind, did you sit down and think,

554
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,900
I want to hit this revenue target?

555
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,740
Well, you had me on a call with two others a while back

556
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,020
and we all joked about who's going to be the first to get to 83.

557
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,260
And I said, I'm going to be the first.

558
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,820
And so I knew in my brain, I never forgot that.

559
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,300
And I was like, I don't know if I was the first.

560
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,220
I don't know if those, I hope both of them did it.

561
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,340
Both those guys are all small.

562
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,580
Both those guys, I hope they both did it.

563
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,940
I have no idea where their agencies are.

564
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,460
But I was like, even if it's not a competition, I'm going to do it.

565
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,980
And so I think in some ways, that was my goal for this year

566
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,060
is to get to the million recurring.

567
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,260
So just for anyone that hasn't been on any of these calls with Ryan.

568
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,660
So Ryan has already made a million dollars.

569
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,300
This has been months ago, total, since he started.

570
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,100
But now he's on the run rate to make a million dollars per year.

571
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,340
Which again is crazy because you literally just decided

572
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,020
to start researching business models.

573
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,580
And it's not like anything goes wrong with your job.

574
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,180
It's not like you don't like your job.

575
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,100
It's not like you aren't getting paid very well.

576
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,460
You just saw the writing on the wall and you're like, dude,

577
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,660
I don't want to be in a position of someone else controlling my future

578
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,980
or controlling my paycheck.

579
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,940
And so it's crazy, bro.

580
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,580
It's a crazy...

581
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,620
How many months of research did you do before you actually found this model?

582
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:23,980
About three.

583
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,500
I started in like, probably the end of 2021,

584
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,100
just getting up in the morning and just reading about different business models.

585
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,260
Like I knew I was going to commit to one going into the next year,

586
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:41,260
where all year, full year, I was going to commit to one and not look back.

587
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:45,980
And if I failed, I knew I gave it a real shot.

588
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,020
You know what I'm saying?

589
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,260
Like I really gave a real shot at it.

590
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,180
That's the only way that you can know if something works or not.

591
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,140
You can't flirt with it.

592
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,260
You can't try it a little bit.

593
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,740
You got to go for it.

594
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,260
And so I wanted to make sure that the decision I made

595
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,060
about the industry or business model or whatever that I went into

596
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,380
was informed as much by my goals as possible.

597
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,860
And it turned out all right.

598
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,940
Yeah, I'd say it turned out all right, man.

599
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,020
Yeah.

600
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,660
That's insane.

601
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,540
It's exciting even for me.

602
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,260
By the way, Adair said he just closed a business owner just now for $800 a month.

603
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,300
He'll have to watch the replay.

604
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,300
So you got to love that.

605
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,580
Love that.

606
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:30,940
Got to love that.

607
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,220
That's okay.

608
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,620
Go ahead.

609
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,220
Fires me up.

610
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,980
I love closed deals.

611
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,460
Me too.

612
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,700
I love that because...

613
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,260
And by the way, guys, if you ever have to come down to

614
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,660
getting on this call or doing that, that is what you should be doing.

615
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,980
So if you have to schedule a call, just schedule the call.

616
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,620
Go close the deal.

617
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,420
You can watch the replay.

618
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,420
We do love having you on here if you don't have that going on.

619
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,580
But that's what this business model is about.

620
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,460
And going back to the simplicity thing,

621
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,820
the way you're going to make the most amount of money,

622
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,780
the most amount of progress in 2025, guys,

623
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:08,140
is by focusing on how can you ask the most amount of people for money.

624
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,420
Absolutely.

625
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,380
As much as you need to learn the basics,

626
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,660
you need to learn the back linking,

627
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,260
you need to learn the content,

628
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,780
you need to learn how to build sites,

629
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,180
you need to focus on how to get business owners to pay you.

630
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:22,620
That's it.

631
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,100
I learned that from you, man.

632
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,460
That was something that I can hear your voice in my head sometimes

633
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,420
when I think about that.

634
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,340
I think that is just great business advice is

635
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,500
the more that you can ask people for money,

636
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,900
the faster your agency is going to grow.

637
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,940
That's one of the big things I learned in digital landlords is,

638
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,700
and your calls and you talking about that concept,

639
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:52,460
and my goal became one closing call a week.

640
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,420
I have to have one closing call a week.

641
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,980
If there's not a closing call in a week, I'm upset.

642
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,180
It's not someone else's fault.

643
00:32:59,180 --> 00:32:59,740
It's my fault.

644
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,420
But I have to have a closing call every week.

645
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,620
And now I'm trying to get to where I want two closing calls per week.

646
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,540
We've had as many as six in a week.

647
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,060
That's an outlier.

648
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,660
That's by far the exception.

649
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,420
But it's based on that principle that I learned in digital landlords is

650
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,100
you just have to be asking people for money

651
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,380
because if you're not, it's a hobby.

652
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:19,980
Yeah.

653
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,220
Yeah.

654
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,420
And people don't want to hear that.

655
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,340
Especially people in other groups.

656
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,420
Sometimes maybe I'll go and do a call with people in other groups.

657
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:33,580
And I'll always ask how many people are making money and whatever.

658
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,300
We'll raise our hand.

659
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,980
I'm like, well, the rest of you guys just have a hobby.

660
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,500
And it really makes people uncomfortable.

661
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,220
But it's the truth.

662
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,340
But yeah, I mean, to speak on that really, really quick, guys.

663
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:48,220
For me, the thing that changed the entire game

664
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,700
is I just sat there and looked at it.

665
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,620
I'm like, look, there's certain things.

666
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,980
By the way, Gabriel Ryan.

667
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,020
Been a minute, bro.

668
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,820
What's up, dude?

669
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,620
Good to have you on.

670
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,580
Gabriel Ryan is in, I think, Nashville, by the way.

671
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,300
Just from my memory.

672
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,580
All right, 2C, baby.

673
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,300
What's up?

674
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:09,660
Yeah, he was in Oregon, then Vegas, then Nashville.

675
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,020
But anyway, good to see you on, Gabriel.

676
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,540
But yeah, guys, for me, it was just like this idea of

677
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,260
there are certain things in our life we never miss.

678
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,020
We always find a way to sleep.

679
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,140
Whether it's on the airport floor or whether it's in our car.

680
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,500
We always find a way to eat.

681
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,260
We always, well, not always, but typically find a way to shower.

682
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,660
Even if it's like with a baby wipe, you know?

683
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,780
Even if, whatever.

684
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,420
So then I'm like, dude, if I took that exact...

685
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,100
And for me, another thing that wasn't like a necessity,

686
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,900
but I always found myself doing was going and exercising.

687
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:44,700
And I was like, dude, I'm so dedicated to this.

688
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,660
And that's great.

689
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,820
But like, what if I took this same commitment

690
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,780
where I never miss, I'll wake up at 3 before a vacation

691
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,060
just to make the gym.

692
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,900
Why don't I just take that and turn it

693
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,140
and make it the same with my business and making money?

694
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,980
I said, man, my business, my bank account would sure look a lot more fat.

695
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,300
And that's what I did in 2020.

696
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,380
It was like, if I didn't have a certain amount of closing calls

697
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,300
every single week, I tried to go for one every single day,

698
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,620
which obviously you have to have a lot of things going,

699
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,700
a lot of things moving to get to that point.

700
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,420
But that's it.

701
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,380
It's like, how do we get...

702
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,380
How do we ask somebody for money every single day?

703
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,820
And if we don't, we're not okay.

704
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,980
And that was the whole thing.

705
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,140
And one little hack, I think I shared this...

706
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,580
I can't remember if I shared this on here or on a WhatsApp message.

707
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,820
But guys, a little thing that I did that was so valuable

708
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,820
that helped me so much is in 2020,

709
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,100
I started scheduling a sales call for Saturday morning

710
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,300
at like 6.37 a.m. every single Saturday.

711
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,180
And the reason why I would do it is the business owner,

712
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,620
contrary to what you might think, the business owner actually is...

713
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,060
That's the time they're actually getting stuff done on their business,

714
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,180
not just in their business.

715
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,780
They're usually undistracted.

716
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:00,380
The other thing is you don't really feel like going out on Friday night

717
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,260
if you know you got a 7 o'clock Saturday morning.

718
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,980
So it caused me to have a really disciplined schedule.

719
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,700
And then lastly is what a better way to start the weekend,

720
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,100
not partying, not going out and getting drunk,

721
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,540
but waking up at 7 a.m. and putting new money,

722
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,220
injecting new money into your business.

723
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,700
So anyway, that was something that really, really changed everything for me.

724
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,260
It made me have a phenomenal weekend, got me excited for Sunday.

725
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:27,020
I would give myself the rest of the day and Sunday off apart from the planning.

726
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,500
But that was huge is just focusing on

727
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,580
how do you get somebody to give you money?

728
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,020
How do you ask somebody for money every single day?

729
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,100
And if you could figure that out, you're going to make a lot of money

730
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,020
because it's just a numbers game, you know?

731
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,300
It is. Yeah.

732
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,900
That's one of the major things I learned here in this group

733
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,540
is you just have to be hitting up people for money as much as you possibly can.

734
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,860
And then I realized that means having all the inventory.

735
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,660
You know, got to have things moving on the back end to do that.

736
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,580
100%, man. 100%.

737
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,180
So for some, let's talk about somebody that's just starting out

738
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,780
or maybe somebody that's like starting out, meaning there's no deals.

739
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,500
Starting out, meaning, you know, maybe they've gotten distracted

740
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,980
and they found their way back and they're like, hey, this is my year.

741
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,540
I'm really going to give this year my all.

742
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,900
What should they, what are some recommendations of what were,

743
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,300
you know, some things that they should do or not do

744
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,380
from somebody like yourself that started two years ago

745
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,780
and in two years, for those that are just joining,

746
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,300
has scaled up to $87,000 a month, built a software tool

747
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,780
and is on track to absolutely obliterate those numbers this year.

748
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,540
What's your advice for somebody that's brand new?

749
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,540
And while you're doing that, I have got to turn down my heat.

750
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,380
I'm sweating so bad. Keep going.

751
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,460
Yeah, if you're brand new, I still like watch the posts of digital landlords

752
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,740
and see people that post stuff.

753
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,100
If you're brand new to this business model

754
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:58,060
and you started in the last 30 to 45 days here in the group

755
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,340
or started doing rank and rank in the last 30, 45 days

756
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,540
and you're running ads and you're getting like okay performance,

757
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,180
but not great performance and you're wondering about lead flow

758
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:07,980
and things like that.

759
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,580
If you're getting momentum in this time of year, that's awesome, right?

760
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,860
Because it's only going to increase going into the spring.

761
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,700
Going into quarter one is when you're going to see leads go like this.

762
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,220
I've seen this happen every year for the last three years now.

763
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,780
Going into the spring, the leads are going to increase.

764
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:32,380
And so my word of encouragement is if you are just starting this business model

765
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:39,580
and you're starting in December, you are going to see more momentum

766
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,860
going into the spring, right?

767
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,820
I've seen people post like, hey, what's up with lead flow, whatever.

768
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:48,540
It's like, well, you've got to think about the psychology

769
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,460
of the people who are picking up the phone.

770
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,140
So the people who are picking up the phone

771
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,660
and the people who need things done largely in home services

772
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,900
is my guess is what you're still teaching in the course, Nick,

773
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,900
is like largely in these high ticket niches.

774
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,180
And high ticket niches means that they're going to spend a lot of money.

775
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,780
And they're thinking right now about spending a lot of money

776
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,500
on Christmas presents, on stuff at the end of the year,

777
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:17,340
that's the psychology of the American consumer

778
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,260
and homeowner and business owner right now.

779
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,620
Now, business owners may be different

780
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,860
because they're trying to get into the end of the year tax break

781
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,260
and they're putting more into their property or whatever.

782
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,580
But the homeowners, which can make up 80 plus percent of your leads on average,

783
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,780
are thinking about their kids' Christmas,

784
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,620
they're thinking about traveling,

785
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,900
they're thinking about all of these things

786
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,900
that are not related to their property.

787
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,700
And then you go into quarter one and the magic happens.

788
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,380
The magic happens when they're getting tax refunds,

789
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,940
they're getting bonuses from the previous year,

790
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:51,260
there's cash and capital infusion into a market

791
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,500
and we're also past the election year.

792
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,740
And so despite my growth this year,

793
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,340
I think it could have been even higher

794
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,740
if we were not in an election year

795
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,500
because some of that stuff that Nick talked about

796
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,860
with that squirrely business owner like people aren't buying, I don't know.

797
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,140
I got a lot of that this year.

798
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,780
I think that because we're past that,

799
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,420
there's market confidence regardless of your politics.

800
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,340
It doesn't matter what your political beliefs are.

801
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,260
It's just the decision's been made, yeah.

802
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,380
The decision's been made.

803
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,260
It doesn't matter if you're Democrat or Republican,

804
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,620
none of that matters.

805
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,500
What matters is that we have stability

806
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,060
in the sense of there is someone in the office

807
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,060
and there's going to, every time this happens,

808
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,740
happens every four years,

809
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,820
there's capital infusion back into markets

810
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,260
where money was on the sidelines.

811
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:40,620
So what happens is, and this is maybe more complex,

812
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,580
but I think this is a point worth bringing in,

813
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,740
is that a lot of the purchasing decisions

814
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,740
for people in this industry

815
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:55,020
are made by homeowners and property owners

816
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:00,620
who are always kind of the second money

817
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,860
behind big commercial money,

818
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,260
meaning that a lot of this big commercial money

819
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,980
that's in private equity and commercial properties

820
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,860
and all the growth around those kinds of things

821
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:18,780
will put money into properties and rental properties

822
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,540
and all that commercial money

823
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,700
that comes back into the market

824
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,020
is generally a good signal

825
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,980
for what's going to happen in the residential market.

826
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,220
And all that money is likely,

827
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,900
because it happens every four years,

828
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,340
going to come back in,

829
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,940
and now that we're past the election year,

830
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,540
we're past the holidays,

831
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,780
and I think you can yell at me if you want to,

832
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,260
but I think next year is going to be

833
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,420
one of the biggest years for this industry

834
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,300
because of these factors at play, right?

835
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,660
We're past the election year.

836
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,980
We're going into a brand new 2025.

837
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,900
There's a lot of money that's been on the sidelines

838
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,500
for the last year that we can all start coming back in

839
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,180
and residential markets are going to follow behind that.

840
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:07,980
And so I think the pump is primed for 2025.

841
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,140
And so if you're in, if you just started

842
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,780
and you're wondering about lead flow,

843
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,180
think about what time of year it is, okay?

844
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,020
And then realize that next year

845
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,180
we're already primed for potentially

846
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,940
one of the best years in this industry in a while.

847
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,700
There's a noticeable difference.

848
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,500
From right now, December 15th to December 31st,

849
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,420
it can be a bit weird.

850
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,900
By the way, don't think you can't close deals.

851
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,780
By the way, Adair just closed the deal.

852
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,380
Oh, I didn't even say this, by the way.

853
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,180
Shout out to my little brother, Porter, who just hit 10K.

854
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,740
He's been scrapping for 10K, man.

855
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:48,860
He almost hit it in like a year ago,

856
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,740
and then he got to nine and then he dropped to six.

857
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,500
Then this year he went up to nine, four,

858
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,940
and he's lost three deals.

859
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,820
Some people don't know this.

860
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,580
He lost three deals in a row.

861
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,060
I think he was skipping steps, a little too excited.

862
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,980
And then yesterday I got this call.

863
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,980
I was actually on a sales call with Kyle,

864
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,140
and I got this call and I called him back.

865
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,500
He's like, dude, I finally hit 10K.

866
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,420
So anyway, shout out to you, Porter.

867
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,740
I know you've been scraping your way to get to 10K.

868
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,340
But where was I going with that?

869
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,380
What were we talking about?

870
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,580
Oh, the new year.

871
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,380
And so anyway, there's still deals right now,

872
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,460
but what you're gonna see is from now

873
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,420
till the January 1st can be a little bit weird

874
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,580
with lead flow, with business owners being like,

875
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,180
yeah, I'm taking the time off, whatever.

876
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,620
But even though the weather is the same,

877
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:36,780
generally speaking, the whole mindset shifts January 1.

878
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,660
It's like business, because think about it, dude.

879
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,380
The business owners you wanna work with,

880
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,780
they're having these exact same conversations.

881
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,500
What are we gonna do?

882
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,780
What's our projections this year?

883
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,220
What are we gonna accomplish?

884
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,780
And as part of that, they need more leads.

885
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,380
And so it's like January 1st,

886
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,540
everyone all of a sudden is like, okay, this is my year.

887
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:59,020
I see a night and day difference January 1 in the mentality.

888
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,220
Night and day, dude.

889
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,260
Night and day.

890
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,380
Completely night and day.

891
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,340
And I think that there's a trickle over,

892
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,340
and I think it's like either they're looking for it more

893
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,700
or they do see an increase in calls

894
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,260
and interest from their homeowners.

895
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,020
And sometimes holidays are up.

896
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,860
Now let's get the house fixed up.

897
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,620
Let's get everything tidied up.

898
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,140
We're gonna have an amazing year.

899
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,660
Everyone's in this new, fresh.

900
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,420
It's such a good time of year.

901
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,620
So guys, I know some of my Australian people,

902
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,340
it's very weird right now.

903
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,260
What I would recommend for you guys is

904
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,220
if you don't wanna go run ads or whatever

905
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,620
because you're worried that there's not gonna be a lot of leads,

906
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,500
that's fine.

907
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,180
Then spend the next two weeks

908
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,260
finding your next five to 10 areas.

909
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,820
Go and get familiar with Rank and Run Engine,

910
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,300
the due diligence tool on Rank and Run Engine.

911
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,860
And go knock out, the next two weeks,

912
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,260
go knock out 300 due diligence.

913
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,060
And go have your next 15 areas lined out.

914
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,660
Get your ads ready to go.

915
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,580
And January 1, kick those things on.

916
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,700
I'm speaking for Australia because I've got this little,

917
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,300
by the way, if you're from Australia

918
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,300
and you're targeting Australia,

919
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,020
send me a message.

920
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,580
I've got a group chat specifically for Australia

921
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,260
that I'm kind of trying to learn

922
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,700
some of the more nuanced stuff there

923
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,420
that I can add you to.

924
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,660
But a lot of people there have told me

925
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,180
it's a bit weird right now.

926
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,700
But January 1st, everything changes.

927
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,380
So if you're feeling a little weird

928
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,140
or you just joined whatever,

929
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,780
you could still get deals.

930
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,420
But just know everything's about to change January 1st.

931
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,380
So you got two weeks to get yourself prepared.

932
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,860
I definitely wouldn't take my foot off the gas

933
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,700
but just know in two weeks,

934
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,660
things are gonna get Western as Kyle would say.

935
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,660
Kyle by Kyle, yeah, man.

936
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,140
I agree.

937
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,740
I'm gonna use the word night and day difference.

938
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,500
And I couldn't agree more.

939
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,580
It truly is night and day.

940
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,460
Some of these business owners

941
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,140
are already thinking about January,

942
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,660
but they're not actually doing anything yet.

943
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,420
They're waiting to get past the holidays.

944
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,420
January hits and they're thinking like,

945
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:03,180
how do I grow my business this year more than last year?

946
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,780
And then when you show up as the guy or girl,

947
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,380
it's like, hey, I've got something to take you

948
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,020
to the next level.

949
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,500
They'll listen.

950
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,620
I'm also, I've got, we've had two closing calls this week.

951
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:18,060
We've got another one tonight at five o'clock.

952
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,660
You can close deals in December.

953
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,820
There's still deals happening in December.

954
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,820
What I'm getting at is if you feel like things are,

955
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,900
the momentum isn't quite where you want it.

956
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,220
It's common is all I'm saying, right?

957
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,380
That momentum is a different speed going into quarter one.

958
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,220
One thing I would recommend to you guys,

959
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,100
I know some of you that just joined,

960
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,700
you guys probably just went through this,

961
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,460
but for anybody that's like,

962
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,260
that doesn't know where to start or kind of,

963
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,540
you know, what should I do?

964
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,860
I definitely think it would be worth you guys

965
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,700
go and check out the video that we did

966
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,900
that you guys are supposed to watch

967
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,460
when you first joined called Exhausted But Satisfied.

968
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,380
Watch that video, set your targets for 2025.

969
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,620
And again, this isn't just financial targets.

970
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,740
This could be any target.

971
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,500
And then reverse engineer and break it up by quarter

972
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,540
and by month and figure out exactly that your roadmap

973
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,060
for how to get to that goal.

974
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,580
And you're gonna realize as you do this,

975
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,260
that the map to get to any goal is really not that difficult.

976
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,100
It can be a straight line.

977
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,180
You make it a zigzag because you get emotional

978
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,700
and you get distracted and all these different things.

979
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,340
But if anyone's looking for like some direction there,

980
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,700
go and rewatch that video.

981
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,540
It's called Exhausted But Satisfied.

982
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,700
And go and set your targets because I know for me,

983
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,700
I have to have that clear map to keep me on track.

984
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:43,740
And admittedly, this year, I, yeah, this, this,

985
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,820
I even think, I think I posted about this

986
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,500
or I think I did a live about this.

987
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,940
But we, you know, I've made, this year I made more money

988
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,260
than I've ever made, I think.

989
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,860
But it wasn't, because there wasn't like insane growth

990
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:59,340
like there was, you know, in 2020, for example,

991
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,420
those years always feel better

992
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,500
because you have this, this huge growth.

993
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,260
Even if you make the most amount of money ever,

994
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,660
but you only made slightly more than last year,

995
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,260
it doesn't feel near the same as going from zero to 10

996
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,180
or from 30 to 87.

997
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:16,860
And so I was, you know, in a lot of ways at my own fault

998
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,100
because I made my road zigzag.

999
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,500
I got distracted by a number of things.

1000
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,420
And I, you know, a lot of the stuff I blamed

1001
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,660
on personal stuff, which you can't bring into it.

1002
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,380
But I'm going back to the drawing board,

1003
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,060
back to creating my map,

1004
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,380
back to getting even more simple than I am

1005
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,180
because I've noticed I've let a lot of stuff creep in

1006
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,820
and, you know, it's about subtraction, man.

1007
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:38,700
That's what I've realized.

1008
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,460
So guys, we have just a few more minutes.

1009
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,340
If anybody has any questions for Ryan,

1010
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,380
as we're talking about 2025,

1011
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,060
gearing up for the best of your life,

1012

1013
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:56,620
If not, I'm gonna go ahead and, in addition, or if not,

1014
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,660
I'm gonna go ahead and give away

1015
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,140
a little bit of swag ski on this call.

1016
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,260
So, by the way, Ryan, do you have the 10K hoodie?

1017
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,340
Is that it you're wearing it?

1018
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:07,820
Yeah, bro.

1019
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,060
I don't have a 10K hoodie.

1020
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,340
Oh, dude, you need the 10K hoodie.

1021
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,220
Text me.

1022
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,100
I've got the old flat feet mastery hoodie.

1023
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,620
I much love speed.

1024
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,120
Yeah.

1025
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,580
Yeah, money loves speed.

1026
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,080
Yeah.

1027
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,340
So message me, bro, anyone that's at 10K,

1028
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,420
Porter just got his as well.

1029
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,740
Well, just message me.

1030
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,860
I'll send you the code.

1031
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,660
It's completely free and you guys can get it.

1032
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:34,780
So, Ryan, it is cold.

1033
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,220
Let's get it before it gets warm again.

1034
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,180
Yeah, I want that hoodie.

1035
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,300
That's a dope hoodie.

1036
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,980
Yeah, dude, it's actually really soft, too.

1037
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,180
So it just goes right to your house.

1038
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,300
Be there in a few days.

1039
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,620
Okay, I want to give, because Adair closed the deal,

1040
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,020
I'm gonna give some swag to Adair.

1041
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,300
Let's go ahead and swag winner.

1042
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,900
Message Ashley for a t-shirt.

1043
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,260
All right, I'm gonna go ahead and give him.

1044
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,980
And then I gotta hook up some of my,

1045
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,860
I got a couple of my friends that are local

1046
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,740
that I gotta hook up.

1047
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:14,060
I'm gonna give, I gotta give,

1048
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,100
because I see them on the call.

1049
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,580
Let's see, I gotta give Mahmood, by the way.

1050
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,900
Mahmood, he's been here from the beginning, man.

1051
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,780
Mahmood's swag winner.

1052
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,060
I know you've been a swag winner before,

1053
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,420
but that's okay, I'm gonna give you more.

1054
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:30,140
Message Ashley, I'm gonna give Kevin, my man, Kevin Moss.

1055
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,340
Met him in West Africa, of all places.

1056
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,100
Go figure.

1057
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:40,460
And Mr. Kudlik as well.

1058
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,900
All right, oh, and I gotta give my friend Big Mill, hold on.

1059
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,620
All right, let's go right there.

1060
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:52,540
Beautiful.

1061
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,060
Okay, so Kevin Moss, message Ashley.

1062
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,740
Big Mill Dutton, message Ashley.

1063
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,340
Adair, Mahmood, if you won the swag,

1064
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,780
just message Ashley, she'll give you a code.

1065
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,660
Go to our store at shop, here, I dropped a thing.

1066
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:12,060
DigitalLandlords.com, and she'll give you the code.

1067
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,020
You can go right to your house.

1068
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,820
It goes right to your house.

1069
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,060
So, Ryan Dalton, dude, I appreciate you being on, man.

1070
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,100
I know you're super busy.

1071
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:20,620
And once again, guys, if you haven't already,

1072
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,340
go jump in, check out Rankin' Ren Engine.

1073
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,180
It is, like, with that code, it's like,

1074
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,020
with that code, what is it, like, 70 bucks, 80 bucks?

1075
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,860
$77, yeah.

1076
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:33,420
It's crazy.

1077
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:37,260
I mean, I don't, not to be that person that's like,

1078
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,020
you know, it's one dollar a day,

1079
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,980
but it's like two and a half bucks a day.

1080
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,500
Run your whole agency.

1081
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,460
Keep everything in one place.

1082
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,340
So go play around with it.

1083
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,620
Even if you guys just do a free account,

1084
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,540
to go see how smooth this thing is.

1085
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,820
Go start with the free account,

1086
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,500
but I would recommend jumping in.

1087
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,460
And that's just, that's one of the things

1088
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,740
I'm gonna use to scale this year.

1089
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,940
So check that out.

1090
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,940
There's a code if you scroll up in the chat,

1091
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,340
and let's go have the best year of our lives.

1092
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:02,780
Why not?

1093
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,580
Yeah, dude, for sure, man.

1094
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:08,060
Yeah, I'm excited about 2025.

1095
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,260
I think it's gonna be the best year

1096
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,420
in this industry for a lot of us.

1097
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,500
For everybody who's doing it,

1098
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,180
I think it's just gonna be off the rails.

1099
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,980
Like, it is crying for it.

1100
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:18,860
Pretty excited about it.

1101
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,180
What's your, let's speak it into existence.

1102
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,700
What's your revenue target by next year?

1103
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:25,980
Don't be shy.

1104
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,260
By the way, for anyone that thinks

1105
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:27,900
I'm sitting here going,

1106
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,180
oh, I don't want Ryan to pass me,

1107
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,700
no bigger compliment than Ryan destroying my,

1108
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,980
my highest was a 121, I think,

1109
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,660
121 to 124 in a month.

1110
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:38,460
It was one month.

1111
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,740
We didn't have the systems in place.

1112
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,780
We dropped back down.

1113
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,380
But I've been like an average hundred.

1114
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,180
I hope you obliterate, just so you know.

1115
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,940
And that's, I mean that from the bottom of my heart.

1116
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,620
So tell me the number now.

1117
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:56,300
Um, I want to be, I want to be at, um,

1118
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,860
my, my dream goal,

1119
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,340
the one I would push for is 2 million ARR

1120
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,180
by the end of 2020.

1121
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,420
But I love that.

1122
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,460
And that's my goal.

1123
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:08,860
I don't know.

1124
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,420
I don't know what that would be for my net.

1125
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,340
I mean, yeah, 2 million top line.

1126
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,740
Yeah, that'd be a great,

1127
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,860
that'd be amazing, bro.

1128
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,060
And it totally doable.

1129
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:22,700
I think it can be done.

1130
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,300
Yeah, guys.

1131
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,100
One of the reasons why being in this group

1132
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,940
and in groups like this is important

1133
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,980
is just being around people

1134
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,100
that have these big visions.

1135
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,940
And so I know some of us are sitting there.

1136
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,780
Oh my gosh, I got to get to 10K.

1137
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,620
And then we've got people like Ryan

1138
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,540
that's trying to get to $2 million this year.

1139
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,940
So when you find people like Ryan,

1140
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:41,740
keep them close to you.

1141
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:42,860
Yeah.

1142
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:43,420
Love this group.

1143
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,700
Love visual landlords.

1144
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,580
Learn tons here.

1145
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,140
You guys are an awesome community of people.

1146
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,780
I made probably lifelong friends in this group.

1147
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,260
Nick knows what he's talking about, you guys.

1148
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:59,580
Nick is the greatest resource

1149
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,180
in this industry that you could find.

1150
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,700
He does a phenomenal job

1151
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,740
of making it very relatable and understandable.

1152
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,260
And this is where I got started.

1153
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,340
I was homegrown first in AOP

1154
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,260
and then art of digital real estate now

1155
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,940
and then digital landlords.

1156
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:17,020
And there's so much that's possible in this industry.

1157
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,500
So thanks to Nick and digital landlords

1158
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,700
for having me on these calls

1159
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,780
and for this great community of people.

1160
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,620
Because honestly like the community

1161
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,500
is what one makes it fun to do the business model

1162
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,180
because you got people doing it with you.

1163
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:33,340
And you learn from people that are in the group, right?

1164
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,780
They try things and they work

1165
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,300
and you add it into your agency

1166
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,300
and you get better and they get better.

1167
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:42,060
And people that it's not cheap to get in here

1168
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:45,660
to get in this group, to be on this call ain't cheap.

1169
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:49,820
And you'll find that we'll pay for itself over and over

1170
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,900
and over again if you dedicate yourself to it.

1171
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,620
So thanks Nick for having a great group

Okay. That said, let's get after it.

00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:05,500
Thanks, Ryan.

00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,020
Cool. See you.
