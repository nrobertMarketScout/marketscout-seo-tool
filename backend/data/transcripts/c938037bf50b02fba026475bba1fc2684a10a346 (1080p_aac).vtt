00:00.000 --> 00:04.740
Guys, in this training, I'm gonna be talking about something that you are not doing that

00:04.740 --> 00:10.420
is costing you tens of thousands of dollars, and I say you're not doing, I'm not speaking

00:10.420 --> 00:14.760
for 100% of people, but I'm speaking for 99% of people, okay?

00:14.760 --> 00:20.000
And this is supposed to be live training, I tried to go live, I'm in London, hotel Wi-Fi

00:20.000 --> 00:24.640
is crappy, so I'm just gonna record this, and then if you're watching this, it's because

00:24.640 --> 00:25.640
it was posted.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.180
I apologize, couldn't do it live.

00:27.180 --> 00:29.980
That's how the cookie crumbles sometimes, guys.

00:29.980 --> 00:34.780
So let me pull up my notes really quick, I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.

00:34.780 --> 00:41.300
This is something, guys, what I'm gonna talk about today is something that I wish, I truly

00:41.300 --> 00:45.980
wish that somebody would have told me and would have allowed me to do, would have encouraged

00:45.980 --> 00:50.340
me to do, but that was not the case whatsoever, and I'll kind of get into what I mean by that

00:50.340 --> 00:52.460
here in just a second, okay?

00:53.060 --> 00:58.740
What I'm gonna talk about today is something that literally has made me, you know when

00:58.740 --> 01:03.720
people say it's made me millions of dollars, and it just sounds cliche, this has actually

01:03.720 --> 01:10.100
made me millions of dollars, I can definitively say it has made me not one, not two, multiple

01:10.100 --> 01:12.700
millions of dollars, okay?

01:12.700 --> 01:16.660
So let me start by saying this, guys, I grew up, let me get all this stuff out of my way

01:16.660 --> 01:23.140
because I want to put my elbow here, because I grew up in a household and in a family and

01:23.140 --> 01:30.500
in a community where I was taught that you should let your actions speak for themselves,

01:30.500 --> 01:31.500
okay?

01:31.500 --> 01:35.980
I was taught that you didn't need to talk about your success, you shouldn't talk about

01:35.980 --> 01:39.700
your success, you should just do, okay?

01:39.700 --> 01:44.220
Which I do respect, and I get, but that was how I grew up, okay?

01:44.260 --> 01:48.420
And I'm guessing that a lot of you guys, because I know a lot of you guys and I've talked to

01:48.420 --> 01:53.720
many of you, probably the majority of you I've had a conversation with, and I know you

01:53.720 --> 02:00.620
guys grew up in similar kind of circumstances and similar kind of ways of growing up, okay?

02:00.620 --> 02:04.300
And so I want to just talk about this for just a second, and for the record I just want

02:04.300 --> 02:10.260
to mention that I do appreciate how I was brought up and I learned a lot from it and

02:10.260 --> 02:13.140
in many, many ways I agree, okay?

02:13.340 --> 02:18.500
However, I have to make a point, and we have to remember that the world is also different.

02:18.500 --> 02:22.980
The world is very different than it was, you know, when I grew up in, let's say I was in

02:22.980 --> 02:28.980
high school and I was 12, let's say 20 years ago, you know, the world 20 years ago compared

02:28.980 --> 02:34.300
to today is not even, it doesn't even resemble, it's not even close, okay?

02:34.300 --> 02:39.300
The world wasn't near as noisy, one, and attention wasn't near as valuable.

02:39.300 --> 02:42.580
We live, and I know this kind of sounds like I'm stealing this from Gary V, because he

02:42.580 --> 02:46.060
always says this, but we literally live in an attention economy, and the people that

02:46.060 --> 02:49.220
make the money are the ones that know how to get attention and they convert it into

02:49.220 --> 02:53.020
money, and that wasn't the case back then, okay?

02:53.020 --> 02:57.620
So I don't fault my parents or anyone that grew up around me that was always encouraging

02:57.620 --> 03:04.460
me not to talk, not to get attention, to lay low, to let my actions speak for themselves,

03:04.460 --> 03:08.900
and that's just the advice that I was given, but I want you to keep in mind guys that as

03:09.060 --> 03:12.940
of course our parents and the people that are around us were trying to do what's best

03:12.940 --> 03:17.580
for us and what's right by us, but they, like, the world has changed, okay?

03:17.580 --> 03:18.580
That's the point, okay?

03:18.580 --> 03:21.500
And we are here to make money.

03:21.500 --> 03:26.180
We are here talking about how do you make money, how do we get out of the rat race,

03:26.180 --> 03:29.940
and so with that said guys, just know that the world has changed.

03:29.940 --> 03:37.940
Alright, when I first started in 2016, this is nine years ago, I had the biggest scarcity

03:37.980 --> 03:40.060
mindset in business, okay?

03:40.060 --> 03:43.980
To the extent, guys, that I remember going through my Facebook friends and I thought,

03:43.980 --> 03:50.060
you know what, anybody that's in my Facebook friends, that's in one of these rank and rent

03:50.060 --> 03:55.620
and digital real estate or digital marketing groups, I'm deleting them as a friend, I don't

03:55.620 --> 03:58.980
want to know you, I don't want to talk to you, I don't want you looking at my page and

03:58.980 --> 04:02.860
seeing what pages I've liked, and then you can maybe find out my niche and you can see

04:02.860 --> 04:07.140
that my clients are friends with me, and that's literally the way that I thought, and I remember

04:07.340 --> 04:12.100
literally sitting there one day, and I went through, and anybody that was a friend that

04:12.100 --> 04:16.780
had a mutual friend with a few different people that I knew were part of this other group,

04:16.780 --> 04:20.140
I just deleted them, gone out of my life, don't care, don't want to talk to you, don't

04:20.140 --> 04:24.860
want to, I wanted to be a fly on the wall, and I was that guy that would be in the group,

04:24.860 --> 04:30.580
and I was consuming stuff, but I was very, there was no producing, there was no value

04:30.580 --> 04:35.660
being added, it was just consume, go in, lurk, get out, okay?

04:36.180 --> 04:41.620
I didn't interact, I didn't post, I didn't share, and I only came in the group to ask

04:41.620 --> 04:45.620
questions when I absolutely had to, okay?

04:45.620 --> 04:51.060
And that was how I was, that was 2017, 18-ish, okay?

04:51.060 --> 04:54.260
Probably up until about 2019.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.620
Somewhere along the line, this is where we're going to get into what I want to share with

04:56.620 --> 05:00.920
you guys, somewhere along the line, I started noticing, you know, I heard people point this

05:00.920 --> 05:05.620
out and they talked about this attention thing, but I started noticing people that were like

05:05.980 --> 05:10.300
really taking off, and we're talking about the, you know, Grant Cardona, I don't know,

05:10.300 --> 05:16.660
from like 2012 to 2020, he had this tremendous, still very relevant, but had this huge run,

05:16.660 --> 05:23.100
and he was, you know, very captivating and polarizing, and I watched him, obviously Gary

05:23.100 --> 05:31.620
Vee, and then I remember watching just somebody like Jake Paul, this is 2019, 2020, and just

05:31.620 --> 05:35.420
people were like, that guy, he's kind of a clown, but that dude knows how to get attention,

05:35.420 --> 05:39.620
he's a genius marketer, and I was like, yeah, they're actually right, this guy knows how

05:39.620 --> 05:43.940
to get attention, and so as I saw this and I saw what he was doing, Jake Paul was taking

05:43.940 --> 05:49.540
his attention, he was getting attention, he was turning it into, in the case now, since

05:49.540 --> 05:54.220
2020, 2019, he was turning it into fights, where he'd go, you know, create these fights,

05:54.220 --> 05:57.660
he'd get a bunch of people to view it, and he was making millions, and he still is making

05:57.660 --> 06:03.980
millions and millions of dollars, and so that was when I realized like, there's something

06:03.980 --> 06:08.300
here, and I'm missing something, and yeah, it's embarrassing, and yeah, I didn't grow

06:08.300 --> 06:13.700
up like this, and yeah, you know, I'm not making that much money, but there is value

06:13.700 --> 06:18.500
in building an audience, okay, and so here's what I did, and this is where I went right,

06:18.500 --> 06:22.940
and I didn't, I had to do it very strategically because the groups that I were in, they did

06:22.940 --> 06:29.860
not, they did not encourage this, in fact, they really hated this because they felt threatened

06:29.860 --> 06:33.860
that somebody was gonna come in and take their business or have more influence, whatever,

06:33.860 --> 06:38.140
and I have a complete opposite approach, but anyway, 2020, guys, as I started scaling

06:38.140 --> 06:42.780
up, as I started going on my run, as I started, and my run being from eight to 10,000 bucks,

06:42.780 --> 06:47.460
scaling up to that $100,000 per month mark, I just intuitively knew like, Nick, you need

06:47.460 --> 06:51.180
to share your story, you need to start, you know, adding value, I didn't know at that

06:51.180 --> 06:54.300
time what it was gonna be worth, I didn't know if people were gonna resonate with it,

06:54.300 --> 06:59.740
but I just started sharing my journey, I started sharing the deals that I was closing, I shared

06:59.740 --> 07:05.660
when we added $10,000 in one month in revenue, I shared when I figured out the lead value

07:05.660 --> 07:08.860
calculator, I remember making the video talking about the lead value calculator in one of

07:08.860 --> 07:13.300
my groups, I was in Virginia, and I sat in my hotel room, and I was like, this is like

07:13.300 --> 07:17.340
the most genius way to come up with pricing, and it's working for me, let me go ahead and

07:17.340 --> 07:21.500
make this video, and I shared it in the group, and people loved it, and I was just, I probably

07:21.500 --> 07:26.820
made like, in 2020, I probably made like eight to 10 posts, it's nothing crazy, but it was

07:26.980 --> 07:31.420
just the things I was learning, the wins, I didn't share, I didn't have a ton of losses,

07:31.420 --> 07:34.700
to be honest, but I didn't share a lot of losses, which I wish I would have shared more

07:34.700 --> 07:42.180
of, but I just started sharing stuff, man, I just started sharing my journey, and scary

07:42.180 --> 07:47.460
at first, I remember, you know, pushing posts on some of these different posts, and just

07:47.460 --> 07:50.140
wondering if anyone was gonna like it, or if it was gonna be that post that had one

07:50.140 --> 07:54.740
like or no likes, and it was three days later, but people really, really liked it, and so

07:54.780 --> 07:59.460
what happened, started happening, guys, is over time, throughout 20, I did this in 2020,

07:59.460 --> 08:05.340
then I did it again in 2021, and over time, guys, I started building this little micro

08:05.340 --> 08:08.940
following inside of some of these groups, just by sharing my story, and sometimes the

08:08.940 --> 08:12.020
people would actually reach out to me and ask me questions, other times, and I didn't

08:12.020 --> 08:15.940
even know this, people would just kind of keep an eye on me, maybe they wouldn't even

08:15.940 --> 08:20.500
add me as a friend, I only found this out like three, four years later, when people,

08:20.500 --> 08:25.060
let's say, some of you guys, some of you are those people, had joined this group or

08:25.060 --> 08:29.260
got on a call with me and said, hey, I remember you in such and such group, the posts that

08:29.260 --> 08:31.900
you're making, and I saw one of them, and I remember thinking like, I gotta watch out

08:31.900 --> 08:38.020
for this guy, right? Guys, doing this, I did this for two years, all of 2020, all of 2021,

08:38.020 --> 08:43.180
it did not make me any money, like it didn't make me $0, so imagine every time I wrote

08:43.180 --> 08:48.260
a post, let's say it took me 30 minutes to write a thought provoking, not a thought provoking,

08:48.420 --> 08:53.620
an experience that also was thought provoking post, I wasn't seeing money from that 30 minutes,

08:53.620 --> 08:57.300
right? But I guess just deep down, I knew that it was gonna be worth it, so I kept doing it,

08:57.300 --> 09:03.460
kept doing it, kept doing it, again, 2020, 2021, and guys, by the end of 2021,

09:05.140 --> 09:08.980
that all changed, because I was getting so many messages from people,

09:09.780 --> 09:12.660
not even just following me, but people were literally sending me messages, hey, how you

09:12.660 --> 09:15.060
doing this, how you coming up with the price, how you getting the flat fee deal, how'd you do the

09:15.060 --> 09:19.780
pre-sale, how'd you do 10,000 a month, how did you do this, and I was answering all the questions

09:19.780 --> 09:23.460
that I could, but I knew that I was just drowning, because there's no way I could keep up with all

09:23.460 --> 09:27.300
of it, so that's when I started putting everybody in a free Facebook group, and just sharing what

09:27.300 --> 09:32.980
was working once, and letting everybody consume it, okay? And so, what ended up happening from

09:32.980 --> 09:37.140
that, and this is where I made my money, and I'm not saying that your journey's gonna be the exact

09:37.140 --> 09:41.620
same, but you guys are gonna be surprised at the different opportunities that are gonna be there,

09:41.620 --> 09:46.260
if you guys will build a following, if you will create influence, if you will

09:47.620 --> 09:51.540
make yourself an authority in this space, and in this group, and I'm literally giving you the

09:51.540 --> 09:57.700
platform, I'm asking you to do it, I'm allowing you to do it, and it sounds like funny, but

09:58.420 --> 10:02.740
I was never part of groups where they let you do that. Every time I would make a post,

10:02.740 --> 10:05.460
it's like, what are you trying to do, what are you trying to sell, I'm like, I'm not trying to sell

10:05.460 --> 10:09.540
anything, I'm just trying to let people know what I'm up to, and trust that I know what I'm talking

10:09.540 --> 10:14.100
about, because if I end up doing something, I wanna have people that have seen me, that know me,

10:14.100 --> 10:17.780
that trust me, okay? So guys, I put all these people in a Facebook group, I've been doing this

10:17.780 --> 10:23.380
for two years, making these posts, people have been following me, and I realized based on the

10:23.380 --> 10:29.940
feedback, and the questions, and the DMs, I was like, people need what I have, people wanna know

10:29.940 --> 10:34.020
how to sell, people, you know, yeah, there's a million courses out there that teach you how

10:34.020 --> 10:38.340
to rank a website, there's a million courses that teach you how to get leads, and a lot of them are

10:38.340 --> 10:44.260
good, but most of these people do not know how to sell, they do not know who to call, how to call,

10:44.260 --> 10:48.580
what to say, how to overcome objections, how to send a screencast that's gonna eliminate the

10:48.580 --> 10:52.340
objections, how to close, what happens if, they don't know any of this stuff, and this is the

10:52.340 --> 10:58.180
stuff that I'm good at, this is stuff that I've been perfecting, guys, for, you know, for two years,

10:58.180 --> 11:05.380
I mean, more like six, but two years just grinding it out, and so what I ended up doing is I ended

11:05.380 --> 11:08.660
up saying, you know what, I'm gonna start a program, this ended up being Digital Landlords,

11:08.660 --> 11:14.900
I'm gonna start a program, and I'm going to start with a beta group, and I'm gonna take a certain

11:14.900 --> 11:19.300
amount of students, and I'm gonna take them, I'm gonna train them, I'm gonna do everything that

11:19.300 --> 11:23.700
can give them the best service I can possibly give them, at a discount, because they're taking

11:23.700 --> 11:30.020
a risk with me, because I have no credentials, I have no, you know, case studies, whatever,

11:30.100 --> 11:35.140
and I'm gonna go help them have tremendous success, and from that, then I'm gonna like

11:35.140 --> 11:40.660
really launch my program, and see where I can take this thing, and so guys, what I ended up doing is

11:40.660 --> 11:45.860
I went into my Facebook group, I went live the day before Thanksgiving, I jumped on, I said, look,

11:45.860 --> 11:50.020
here's the deal, I wanna start a program, I'm gonna teach everything that I know about selling,

11:50.020 --> 11:54.180
about scaling, about doing this business the way that I've done it, that allowed me to get to

11:54.180 --> 12:01.540
$100,000 per month, if you wanna check out the offering, get on a webinar on Monday, that's it,

12:01.540 --> 12:06.900
fill out an application that says you wanna apply to the actual call, I'm gonna be pitching you guys

12:06.900 --> 12:12.020
on what the offer is, but if you want, it's gonna be discounted, because guess what, there is no

12:12.020 --> 12:16.500
program, I'm gonna teach it to you live, there is no Facebook group, I'm gonna create it as soon as

12:17.300 --> 12:22.180
we do this webinar, I have nothing to show, so you have to just have faith in me and what I'm doing,

12:22.740 --> 12:30.500
and so I did this webinar the next Monday, and I had, I think it was 32 or 33 people show up,

12:31.060 --> 12:37.220
and there was only one person that did not buy, now they all didn't buy right on the spot, but

12:37.220 --> 12:42.340
within a few days, the few people that didn't buy, we ended up working out some kind of a resolution,

12:42.340 --> 12:47.300
and there was only one person that, by the way, that same person, I see them all the time kicking

12:47.300 --> 12:52.420
around the free groups, kicking around the free resources, it's been three years now, and they're

12:52.420 --> 12:58.660
still stumbling around trying to avoid paying the piper, it's hilarious, and I always see them,

12:58.660 --> 13:03.540
and I'm like, that's funny, that's the one person that didn't buy. Guys, that first day,

13:04.580 --> 13:11.460
I made almost 100,000 bucks, I was like 97,000, literally, I don't know, I almost made 100,000

13:11.460 --> 13:20.020
bucks in that very first day. Now, why do I tell you that? Because that all came and that was all

13:20.020 --> 13:25.620
possible because I built influence, because I built a micro following, I didn't know what it

13:25.620 --> 13:30.340
was gonna look like, I didn't know if I was gonna do a program, I didn't know if I was gonna do

13:30.340 --> 13:34.660
consulting, I didn't know if I was gonna do anything, but I spent the time, I made about

13:34.660 --> 13:40.180
10 posts in 2020, I probably made the same in 2021, I answered people's questions, I was active

13:40.180 --> 13:46.020
in the group, I spent time in the DMs, not a lot of time, but I spent time, and I just started

13:46.020 --> 13:52.980
building my brand as Nick Wood, as somebody who owns this agency called Evergreen, and I started

13:52.980 --> 13:58.980
building this little micro following inside of this really unknown niche called Rankin Rent,

13:58.980 --> 14:03.700
inside of a few Facebook groups, just by sharing my story, just by sharing my wins,

14:03.700 --> 14:10.580
sharing a few losses, commenting, giving my input, sharing a tip here, sharing a strategy,

14:10.580 --> 14:15.220
that's all that I did, guys, and literally made on my very first day when I decided to monetize

14:15.220 --> 14:21.300
this, I made 100,000 bucks, give or take, let's call it 95,000, and literally some of these people

14:21.300 --> 14:27.940
had just seen a post, and that's it, that's it. So what I'm telling you guys to do, guys,

14:27.940 --> 14:35.940
and I'm encouraging you to do, and what I'm suggesting you do, and by the way, I apologize,

14:35.940 --> 14:40.340
I'm kind of trying to talk a little bit quiet, I can hear somebody's outside cleaning,

14:40.340 --> 14:44.260
I got people next door, I'm trying to be a little bit quiet and respectful here,

14:44.980 --> 14:51.060
as I'm in the hotel room, and it's the afternoon, but guys, I'm asking you to do the same thing,

14:51.060 --> 14:54.580
okay, and I'm gonna tell you why I'm suggesting it, what's in it for me, because there is a benefit

14:54.580 --> 14:59.060
for me, and I'm gonna tell you why here in just a second, but I'm not only allowing you to do it,

14:59.060 --> 15:03.300
I'm asking you to do it, I'm suggesting you do it, and it is going to be worth your time,

15:03.300 --> 15:07.060
and I'm not saying that you're gonna start a program, I'm not saying you're gonna do anything

15:07.060 --> 15:12.340
with it immediately, but heaven forbid you build a following, you're already in the group, you're

15:12.340 --> 15:16.020
already asking questions, already finding out answers, if you find out a new answer, you find

15:16.020 --> 15:21.620
out some little thing, it takes you five minutes to go and post about it, right, it's not much,

15:22.180 --> 15:27.460
but heaven forbid you get down the road and you end up meeting somebody who has something

15:27.460 --> 15:33.220
that's really valuable, maybe it's some AI tool that's really valuable for flipping websites,

15:33.220 --> 15:40.580
you know, spinning up websites, whatever, quickly, and you now have, oh, you have an audience, you

15:40.580 --> 15:46.740
have a following, you have a built-in customer base, and those posts that you made when you

15:46.740 --> 15:52.740
had nothing to offer are going to be worth thousands of dollars. Now, the hard part about

15:52.740 --> 15:56.980
this, guys, is that you're not gonna see the money immediately, you don't even know how it's gonna

15:56.980 --> 16:00.340
work, you don't know how you're gonna monetize it, you don't know if you're ever gonna monetize it,

16:01.060 --> 16:07.220
but I will tell you guys that it will be worth your time, even if you don't end up monetizing it,

16:07.220 --> 16:10.820
because I think eventually you will, but even if you never do, it's still gonna be worth your time,

16:10.820 --> 16:15.620
so here's, and my goal was initially, because I was gonna have Porter on this call, I was gonna

16:15.620 --> 16:19.940
have him share his thoughts, because I had this conversation with Porter when he first started,

16:19.940 --> 16:24.020
he was really being quiet, he wasn't sharing a lot, he grew up in the same household as me,

16:24.020 --> 16:32.340
don't talk, don't, whatever, whatever, whatever, and he's even more conservative and, what's the

16:32.340 --> 16:38.980
word, not the same, like he's even more reserved, I guess, than I am, I wanted to have him share

16:38.980 --> 16:41.940
his experience, and I was like, dude, you gotta share, you gotta share your posts, you gotta share

16:41.940 --> 16:46.900
your wins, and you guys don't have to do it in a braggadocious way, you don't have to do it in a

16:46.900 --> 16:52.420
loud manner, like I sometimes come across, I know, I know, it's annoying, but here's what I'm asking

16:52.420 --> 16:57.220
you guys to do, okay, asking you, number one, first of all, you gotta fix your head, you gotta

16:57.220 --> 17:04.580
create an abundance mindset that you know that sharing is not only not gonna hurt you, but it's

17:04.580 --> 17:08.580
the single best thing you can do for yourself, you're building authority, you're building a

17:08.580 --> 17:14.900
micro audience inside of your community, or inside of here, inside of the free Facebook group,

17:14.900 --> 17:18.420
inside of the school community, but you have to have an abundance mindset, you have to realize

17:18.420 --> 17:22.980
that sharing is not gonna hurt you, okay, it's not gonna hurt you, in fact, it's going to help you,

17:22.980 --> 17:28.500
period, okay, again, I'm not only letting you do it, but I'm asking you to do it, okay, so here's

17:28.500 --> 17:33.940
what I'm suggesting that you do, is what I would suggest doing is commit to spending the time

17:34.500 --> 17:38.340
to being vulnerable about your journey, and you're all gonna have different journeys, some of you

17:38.340 --> 17:41.940
guys are gonna get a deal right out the gate, and you're gonna just go, some of you guys are gonna

17:41.940 --> 17:45.300
get a deal out the gate, then you're gonna stumble, and you're gonna get distracted, and you're gonna

17:45.300 --> 17:48.820
leave for six months, and come back, some of you guys are not gonna get a deal for six months, and

17:48.820 --> 17:52.900
then you're gonna get a deal, and then you're gonna crush it, everybody's got a different story,

17:52.900 --> 17:58.020
but I just am imploring you to just share your story, the things you're learning, the things that

17:58.020 --> 18:03.540
the mistakes you've made, the losses, the wins, everything, okay, all I'm asking to do in terms

18:03.540 --> 18:12.820
of like actual actions, is commit to doing two posts a week, okay, that's it, pick two days,

18:13.700 --> 18:23.620
pick two days, Monday, Thursday, Tuesday, Friday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and share a simple win or loss

18:23.620 --> 18:30.580
or lesson learned, and that's it, okay, if you were actually, if you planned out your month,

18:30.580 --> 18:34.260
and you said, hey, I'm gonna do it on these days, there's eight different posts I'm gonna make,

18:34.260 --> 18:38.100
on Sunday, I'm gonna think, what did I learn last week, I'm gonna come up with five ideas,

18:38.100 --> 18:41.860
I'm gonna choose two of them, and I'm gonna share them on those two days, I'm gonna put a picture,

18:41.860 --> 18:45.220
so it makes a little bit more interesting, I'm gonna just think of something interesting to say

18:45.220 --> 18:50.340
in the first line, so people actually know this is a valuable post, and you spent, I bet you that

18:50.340 --> 18:55.860
would take you 30 minutes a week, with the ideas, with the posting, with the whole deal, okay,

18:56.580 --> 19:02.420
two posts, two days, sharing a win or a loss, lesson learned, that's what I'm asking you to do,

19:03.620 --> 19:09.220
do it every single week, and keep doing it, and do it forever, just get used to it, just make it

19:09.220 --> 19:12.580
a habit, just the same way that you freaking drink water, because we're never gonna stop drinking

19:12.580 --> 19:15.780
water, we're never gonna stop eating, we're never gonna stop sleeping, it's just part of what you do,

19:15.780 --> 19:19.860
is you put out content, and you look at it as, hey, I'm producing, I'm doing something that's

19:19.860 --> 19:24.260
adding value, and just becomes part of who you are, and some of you guys that are having a hard

19:24.260 --> 19:27.460
time following what I'm saying, do it because you're helping people, what you guys don't

19:27.460 --> 19:32.660
understand is that a lot of people are watching you, a lot of people are watching you specifically,

19:32.660 --> 19:37.220
you that's listening, they relate to you, not me, not to Kyle, not to Francesco, not to Porter,

19:37.220 --> 19:40.660
but you, for whatever reason, because maybe you're a cop, or maybe you're a school teacher,

19:40.660 --> 19:46.180
or maybe you're a single mom, but it's you that they noticed, and they're waiting for you to fail

19:46.180 --> 19:51.380
or to succeed, and you have no idea how much that does for people, okay, now, let me tell you the

19:51.380 --> 19:56.820
benefits of this, okay, number one, as I said, which is obvious, is you're gonna be building an

19:56.820 --> 20:00.900
audience, you're gonna be building authority, and I assure you that at some future period,

20:00.900 --> 20:05.620
it will be worth your time, and you will be able to cash out later on, I promise you, you will be

20:05.620 --> 20:09.220
able to cash out, okay, you might not choose to, but you will have the option, you will have,

20:09.860 --> 20:15.460
you're building, you're literally putting money, it's kind of like you have a future credit to

20:15.460 --> 20:19.620
cash out, okay, number two, this is another benefit you're gonna have, forget about building an

20:19.620 --> 20:25.380
audience, forget about, you know, a following, but you are doing this, guys, you hold yourself

20:25.380 --> 20:30.580
accountable, when you do this, when you tell people what you're up to, you know, what your goals are,

20:31.620 --> 20:35.940
hey, I'm gonna do this much money, you know, Porter's announced that many times, he's gonna

20:35.940 --> 20:40.980
do $25,000 by the end of the year, he is holding himself accountable, doing this will make you more

20:40.980 --> 20:44.100
money, because you're gonna be talking about your goals, you're gonna be talking about your dreams,

20:44.100 --> 20:47.620
you're gonna be talking about the things that you're planning on doing, you're committing to

20:47.620 --> 20:52.980
doing, it is going to make you more money, okay, and guys, part of that is that when you start

20:52.980 --> 20:57.860
talking about it, in some of these other groups, like the school community inside of the free

20:57.860 --> 21:04.180
Facebook group, I actually, if you send anyone to us, I actually pay you guys a really good

21:04.180 --> 21:07.860
affiliates, there's somebody in this group, I'm not gonna mention their name, but they've made

21:07.860 --> 21:15.860
over 6,000 bucks, just sharing a few wins, and me paying them, because they've sent, I create a

21:15.860 --> 21:20.180
custom application, you get it, they send it, all you have to do is send it to them, they fill it

21:20.180 --> 21:25.060
out, and we close them, you get paid, and it's great money, okay, that's just a side benefit,

21:25.060 --> 21:28.820
but guys, it will make you more money, because it's gonna hold you accountable, okay,

21:28.820 --> 21:33.460
the next thing it's gonna do, guys, it's gonna give you clarity and more understanding about

21:33.460 --> 21:37.620
the things that you're learning, when you teach somebody else something that you learned,

21:38.420 --> 21:42.100
it makes it that much more clear in your mind, when you teach somebody something that you've

21:42.100 --> 21:49.300
learned, and you try to articulate it on paper, or on a post, you learn it better, because you're

21:49.300 --> 21:55.380
now explaining, now you're the teacher, and it makes it, it becomes more clear by you doing that,

21:55.380 --> 22:00.580
okay, so it's very, like that to me is huge, whenever I learn something, and then I post it,

22:00.580 --> 22:05.940
I really sit down, I articulate it correctly, and it forces me to explain it in a way that

22:05.940 --> 22:10.820
people understand it, and it makes me learn it better, okay, and the last benefit, guys,

22:10.820 --> 22:16.500
is you are going to inspire and help people way more than you have, you have no idea how much

22:16.500 --> 22:20.580
people are watching, I remember looking at posts that would inspire me, that got me excited, I

22:20.580 --> 22:24.820
remember being on a cruise back in 2019, when I was determining, should I stay, should I go,

22:24.820 --> 22:30.820
and I was just binge watching, I was binge watching the specific person's videos,

22:31.780 --> 22:35.220
and it did everything to me, I was on at the gym, I would listen to their videos,

22:35.220 --> 22:39.780
and I don't know, man, for some reason, I just related to this specific individual,

22:39.780 --> 22:43.140
and it got me excited, it gave me that fire, that juice, that drive again,

22:43.940 --> 22:48.500
and that was one of the reasons why I stayed, one of the reasons why I kept doing this,

22:48.500 --> 22:53.300
and I was eight, nine months at that point, this is early December 2019, from being at

22:53.300 --> 22:58.580
a hundred thousand bucks per month, okay, so guys, why would I want you to do this, well, because

22:58.580 --> 23:03.140
what it does is actually, it helps both of us, okay, number one, it allows you to grow your

23:03.140 --> 23:08.820
audience for free, you get to build a community within the community, and for me, it serves a

23:08.820 --> 23:13.060
social proof, right, it serves as social proof for people that are in here that are struggling,

23:13.060 --> 23:19.540
that are like, hey, Porter's getting a deal, he's doing the same thing as I'm doing, well,

23:19.540 --> 23:24.180
clearly, it works, right, inside of here, and also, guys, when you share this inside of school,

23:24.180 --> 23:28.500
when you share this inside of the free Facebook group, you have no idea how much that helps me

23:28.500 --> 23:32.660
for social proof, and people, I could say stuff, I could show people how much money I've made,

23:32.660 --> 23:36.660
I could show you my tax returns, I could show you my Stripe accounts, you could talk to my clients,

23:36.660 --> 23:40.980
but for some reason, it just comes out different, and it comes out better when it comes from

23:40.980 --> 23:45.060
somebody else, okay, so for me, it'd be a huge help, and that's the benefit for me, it's going

23:45.060 --> 23:50.260
to give me that social proof, okay, the other thing that it's going to do for me, and for you,

23:50.260 --> 23:54.340
is it's going to bring excitement, it's going to bring energy, it's going to bring that freaking

23:54.340 --> 23:59.940
zeal to this group of, hey, we're closing freaking deals, John Jarwood, he just got a deal,

23:59.940 --> 24:04.020
Irwin just got a deal, Porter just got another deal, Francesca just slammed the deal, what the

24:04.020 --> 24:10.020
heck am I doing, right, it brings the energy, it brings the excitement, and it's intoxicating,

24:10.020 --> 24:14.660
it's amazing, okay, and guys, I will tell you, I pay attention, I know who's active,

24:14.660 --> 24:20.260
I see who posts, I see who comments, I see who is actually doing production, and is giving value,

24:20.260 --> 24:24.500
and who's just a leak, just so you guys know, okay, and I appreciate it, and I will always take care

24:24.500 --> 24:30.660
of you guys, so my challenge to you guys is that you fix your head, you create an abundance

24:30.660 --> 24:35.140
mindset, say, hey, look, you know, and I'm not telling you, you need to go and share exact cities

24:35.140 --> 24:38.980
and exact niches of what you're in, no, I'm not saying that, but if you learn something, if you

24:38.980 --> 24:44.740
go through the trouble of finding something out, go share it, I promise you, I know it sounds like

24:44.740 --> 24:49.140
it's going to be a bad decision, and you're going to create your own competition, guys, I've been

24:49.140 --> 24:57.300
sharing everything I know for years, and it's not ever hurt me, okay, it has never hurt me, you just

24:57.300 --> 25:01.780
got to have an abundance mindset, and you have to know that, hey, I'm somebody that's always in the

25:01.780 --> 25:04.980
game, I'm somebody that's going to be learning the next thing, the next tip, the next trick,

25:04.980 --> 25:08.980
so no matter what I share today, I'm going to have something new tomorrow, and I'm going to help a

25:08.980 --> 25:12.420
bunch of people, and by doing that, they're going to trust me, they're going to follow me, and you

25:12.420 --> 25:17.940
know what, down the road, I might cash in on that thing, I might, okay, so get the abundance mindset,

25:17.940 --> 25:22.740
and all I ask you to do is commit to doing two posts a week, okay, pick two days, share a lesson

25:22.740 --> 25:28.980
learned, a loss, a win, a lesson learned, share it, it doesn't have to be long, it could be a freaking

25:28.980 --> 25:32.340
one line, it could be two lines, it could be a paragraph, it could be a couple paragraphs,

25:32.340 --> 25:35.140
it could be a novel, I don't care, you could have a photo, you don't have to have a photo,

25:35.140 --> 25:40.900
you could do a video, you could do a picture, you could do, I do not care, share two posts a week,

25:40.900 --> 25:45.540
and then when people comment, interact with them, hey, yeah, clarify this, that, and the rest,

25:45.540 --> 25:50.020
guys, this will change everything for you, when you start doing this, it's going to bring you

25:50.020 --> 25:53.860
more clarity, it's going to hold you accountable, it's going to make you more money, and of course,

25:53.860 --> 25:58.100
it's going to help me at the same time. If I had known this, guys, and I had started doing this back

25:58.100 --> 26:03.220
in 2016, and I had shared my journey of, hey, here's where I'm at, and I just got this towing

26:03.220 --> 26:07.060
deal, and then I got this crawl space deal, and oh, I got distracted, and now I'm over here,

26:07.060 --> 26:10.900
those would be the most valuable posts ever, and I'd probably have 10 times more people following

26:10.900 --> 26:16.660
me, and I probably, instead of making $100,000 my very first day, I probably would have made $250,000,

26:16.660 --> 26:20.340
but I didn't know this, and nobody ever told me to do this, and nobody encouraged me to do this,

26:20.340 --> 26:25.460
and nobody allowed me to do it, here I am, I have a community, I've built of 800 people inside this

26:25.460 --> 26:33.220
group, 6,000 people inside of digital, art of digital real estate, and 250 plus, some of the,

26:33.220 --> 26:37.780
you know, there's some overlap from these groups, inside of the school community, the art, sorry,

26:37.780 --> 26:43.940
the rank and rent academy, and I'm letting you guys go and frickin' build your own network,

26:43.940 --> 26:50.260
your own following within my groups that I've built with my money, with my attention, with the

26:50.260 --> 26:55.540
people, with the videos that I've put up, and the production team that I have paid to put them on

26:55.540 --> 26:59.540
YouTube, and to monitor the comments and everything else, I'm letting you tap into that 100% free,

26:59.540 --> 27:03.540
why? Because I want social proof, I want to grow, I want you to grow, that's what this is about,

27:03.540 --> 27:08.180
so guys, you don't have to do this, you can be like I was for the first little bit,

27:09.860 --> 27:13.780
and I was Mr. hey, I'm not even gonna have a website, I'm gonna go get to a million

27:14.740 --> 27:20.340
bucks a year, no website, no brand, I'm proud about it, screw you guys, you don't need it,

27:20.340 --> 27:26.900
whatever, and I did that, okay, but all I can think about now, now that I've made millions of

27:26.900 --> 27:32.260
dollars from doing this, literally millions of dollars from just sharing my journey,

27:33.860 --> 27:37.860
I can't imagine how much money I left on the table, if I would have shared, yeah, I did it

27:37.860 --> 27:42.580
without, I got $100,000 per month without a website, without a brand, nothing, great, good

27:42.580 --> 27:47.460
job, Nick, pat on the back, how much money did you lose out on? I ask myself that all the time,

27:47.460 --> 27:55.300
and I know it's a lot of freaking money, okay, so guys, this is something that if you are not

27:55.300 --> 27:59.540
doing currently, I strongly encourage you, you are missing out on thousands of dollars,

28:00.980 --> 28:04.980
thousands and hundreds of thousands of, possibly millions of future dollars,

28:04.980 --> 28:08.740
it takes a couple minutes a week, just like the slide edge we've been talking about, guys,

28:08.740 --> 28:12.820
you just put this in your calendar, you do it twice a week, it takes you less than 30 minutes,

28:14.420 --> 28:19.860
complete, total 30 minutes, and you start building an audience, and I'm telling you guys in three,

28:19.860 --> 28:26.180
four, one, two years, this is gonna pay off, so guys, I appreciate you watching this video,

28:26.180 --> 28:29.940
I would love, I pay attention, I'd love for you guys to start doing this, it will help me,

28:29.940 --> 28:35.220
it will help you, it will hold you accountable, guys, let's go get it, I've been there, I've done

28:35.220 --> 28:39.460
it, you don't have to listen to what I'm saying, but I do know a thing or two, and I wish I would

28:39.460 --> 28:42.420
have done this earlier, so guys, thanks for watching this video, thanks for watching this

28:42.420 --> 28:44.500
training, I'll see you guys next Tuesday.
