Another question that comes to us is regarding the the CPC limits. Some people want to know

00:06.280 --> 00:12.440
how do you know or what is too high for CPC. So when we go through our Google Keyword Planner

00:12.440 --> 00:18.920
it gives us a range of the low page and the top of page bid. Sometimes those are within a few dollars

00:18.920 --> 00:24.040
of each other. Sometimes there's wide variance. Sometimes you have a low page bid at like six

00:24.040 --> 00:29.000
dollars and the top of page bid could be closer to thirty dollars. When you have those big ranges

00:29.000 --> 00:34.720
it makes it a little more difficult to figure out. But what I typically see when I get that

00:34.720 --> 00:40.720
question is that, and this is an example I have on the screen right now, is that you're choosing

00:40.720 --> 00:45.920
a large city which you're not supposed to do and you're choosing a very competitive niche which

00:45.920 --> 00:51.400
you're not supposed to do. So when we see a large city in a competitive niche you're going to see

00:51.400 --> 00:59.920
that larger more expensive CPC. What is too much? You know according to the training we try to keep

00:59.920 --> 01:05.040
it between like five like around the five dollar range on Simrush. As you go into the ad you'll

01:05.040 --> 01:10.200
see sometimes it's a little bit more. But here I have something brought up. This is an ad that we

01:10.200 --> 01:14.880
were running for Nick for a little while and it was for duck cleaning. I believe that the website

01:14.880 --> 01:20.840
was starting to get some its own organic leads but we were having CPC of up to forty dollars per

01:20.840 --> 01:25.240
click on some of these. And you can see here that we're able to be really good and we're able to

01:25.240 --> 01:30.040
play and keep our average CPC in the ten dollar range and sometimes the fourteen dollar range.

01:30.040 --> 01:37.960
But knowing that niche, and this is for the New Orleans area, so big city, expensive niche, knowing

01:37.960 --> 01:42.280
that it is we know that we're going to spend more. We know it's going to cost a lot to get those leads

01:42.280 --> 01:49.520
and so for us running that ad we weren't afraid of having those thirty dollar clicks because we

01:49.520 --> 01:53.320
know what we were going to get on the other side. We know what niche we were playing in. So for you

01:53.320 --> 01:58.680
guys if you're seeing something that seems way high up there I'd ask you to go back look at the

01:58.680 --> 02:03.640
population of the city. Look at the population that you're running your ads over and think about

02:03.640 --> 02:07.240
what niche you're running because that's typically where I see where that becomes an issue.
