Let's just say like, I don't know, let's just say that health rose over and

00:05.800 --> 00:10.320
they're like, Google becomes allergic to money from agencies and they're like,

00:10.360 --> 00:11.760
ah, we're not going to accept that shit.

00:12.480 --> 00:12.760
Okay.

00:12.760 --> 00:13.720
Guess what we're going to do?

00:14.080 --> 00:16.240
We're going to just use a different fricking ad platform.

00:16.240 --> 00:21.240
It, the Google ads is the, is the technique, the strategy is

00:21.240 --> 00:22.880
results in advance, right?

00:23.000 --> 00:26.040
So like, that's not, that's not the end all be all.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.880
We were, it's just an easy way to feed them leads, but guess what?

00:28.880 --> 00:31.360
If that goes away, we'll spend our money somewhere else.

00:31.840 --> 00:32.880
You know, we'll figure it out.

00:32.880 --> 00:36.320
So obviously that we don't want that to be the case, but like, I'm never

00:36.320 --> 00:38.480
going to lose sleep because I'm a problem solver.
