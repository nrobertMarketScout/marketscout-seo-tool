1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,360
This is a really important thing to talk about because I do have people either asking or

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,120
thinking this and they go well those people that are in the program that haven't gotten

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,340
the deal yet or those that are taking longer those that took longer like what did they

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,520
do wrong or what did they do that I can avoid and I'm going to share that so the biggest

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,000
place that I've seen people get hung up in this process is it's people that come to the table

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,600
they have other websites okay which is not a bad thing they come here maybe they're in another

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,280
program maybe they watch some YouTube videos and they built some sites okay and these sites are

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,080
sites that they never should have built and what I mean by that is there's high cost per click

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,680
there's high competition it's in the wrong niche or yada yada yada yada right so what happens is

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,480
these people that the biggest place I see people get hung up is they come in and they think you

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,400
know what I've got five sites and I'm paying this hosting and I'm getting all this and they're

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,880
like I want to say I want to take this process this flat fee process and I want to go sell

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,560
these five sites first I want to sell all five of them clear you know make sure they all have a

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,320
client and then I'm gonna build and I'm gonna go pre sell okay the reality is that if you knew

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,440
what I'm about to teach you about picking niches and picking cities and looking at cost per click

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,360
you probably wouldn't have built most of those sites okay and so what I found is that most people

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,160
that struggle and it take longer is they don't take my advice they try and take a site they never

18
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,640
should have built in a niche they never should have built it with cost per click that is way

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,720
too high and they try and make it work now you can sell any site I'm not saying that but if you want

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,640
to get a deal as fast as possible to start getting positive cash flow coming in I need you to listen

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,440
to me very very carefully as you are going through module one which is talking about picking the

22
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,840
right city and niche I want you to ask yourself this the following question if I had known what

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,040
I'm being taught right now about how to look at a niche and a city would I still have built this

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,480
site would I still have built that site would I still have built this other site okay and if

25
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:14,600
the answer is no then I don't want you spending your time trying to sell it yet I would rather

26
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,360
you put it on the back burner go and keep doing your SEO whatever or get rid of it because it

27
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,720
might not be worth it I'm not saying to get rid of all of them but I don't want you for your first

28
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,600
deal using this process and trying to sell that website okay down the road that's fine you have

29
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,800
momentum you have steam whatever you cash isn't such a thing that you know a bind that's okay but

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,200
for this this whole this very first deal what I need you to do is I need you to hear me when I

31
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,120
say if I had known what I'm being taught in module one which is how to pick a city in a niche

32
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,560
would I still have built a site if the answer is no do not choose that as your first project

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,080
instead go choose another project that you've already built maybe it's another website generating

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,120
leads or what's most often the case and I would recommend is let's go and pre-sell a deal let's

35
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,200
go and do this thing from start to finish where we pick the city in the niche we build the list

36
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,760
we build the one-pager and we do it step by step exactly as it's being taught because guys the first

37
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,560
deal is the most important okay and what I mean by that is they always say in sales the best time

38
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,760
to get a sale the best time to get a deal is after you've got the last one okay because you have

39
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,840
momentum so I know how this works and I need you to get your first deal because getting that first

40
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,840
deal is gonna open everything up it's mentally gonna open things up and allow you to get the

41
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,080
next one and the next one and the next one so to wrap this up the biggest place people get hung

42
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,240
up is they're trying to take sites they never should have built and use this process to sell

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,800
them and I'm telling you that if you wouldn't have built them after knowing what I teach you

44
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,400
don't spend time on them in the beginning
