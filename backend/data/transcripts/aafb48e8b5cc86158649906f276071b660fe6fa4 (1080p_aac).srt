Hey, Simon says, how can we measure market saturation for digital assets?

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,280
That's that I might need you to give a little bit more information on that.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,880
Maybe you can and I can answer it on a on a comment.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,560
But guys, I'm telling you, those of you guys that are worried about saturation,

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,360
we are there.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,320
Go watch my videos, type in saturation.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,160
Is ranking saturated on YouTube?

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,080
And go listen to my logical answers.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,440
OK, this is not saturated.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,680
And just because you guys are seeing other rank and rep people, other marketers,

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,560
does not mean it's saturated.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,360
Just because there's someone else, the website doesn't mean you can't have one.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,840
Just because there's somebody else that, you know, sorry,

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,720
just because there is somebody that has a website in your niche and city

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,240
does not mean they even have a client.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,640
It doesn't even mean that they're even in the business anymore.

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,360
It doesn't mean that they know how to sell and create a deal.

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,840
You guys have to remember that those websites that you guys see

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,600
and get so scared of there are just like another local business.

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,920
OK, don't worry about that. Keep going.
