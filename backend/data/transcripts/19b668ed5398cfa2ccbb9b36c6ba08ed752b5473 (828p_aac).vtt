WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
out. Okay, I think it's working on my head too. Guys, heads

00:04.200 --> 00:07.760
up. Welcome to call final live how to get to if I was starting

00:07.760 --> 00:13.040
over today, how I would get from zero to $20,000 as quickly as

00:13.040 --> 00:17.200
possible. Appreciate you guys being on. It's 104am for me in

00:17.200 --> 00:20.880
West Africa. But your boy, he took a shower. He's looking

00:20.880 --> 00:23.640
fresh. He's ready to go. I told you I'd come prepared for this.

00:23.640 --> 00:26.640
I've been working on this for a long time. Super stoked to have

00:26.640 --> 00:30.360
you guys on. I really appreciate you being on. But I am in

00:30.360 --> 00:33.080
Africa. So there's a chance my internet goes out. If that

00:33.080 --> 00:35.320
happens, please stay on the live. Porter's going to be able

00:35.320 --> 00:38.920
to be the co host. I'll hop right back on. If the power goes

00:38.920 --> 00:41.520
out, the generator will kick on. But there's going to be a

00:41.520 --> 00:44.280
little little gap. Please stay on and I'm going to give you

00:44.280 --> 00:47.240
some reasons why we're going to be giving away it just for

00:47.240 --> 00:49.920
staying on this live till the end. Number one thing we're

00:49.920 --> 00:52.520
going to be doing is giving you guys a replay. This is not

00:52.520 --> 00:54.560
going to stay up obviously in the free group because that's

00:54.560 --> 00:58.440
changing. But if you stay on this live till the end, you're

00:58.440 --> 01:02.600
going to get a replay of this live today, which I hope you

01:02.600 --> 01:06.120
guys take and watch again and again. You dissect it. You take

01:06.120 --> 01:08.480
notes, everything else. So please stay on that. We're also

01:08.480 --> 01:10.840
going to be doing our giveaways. We've got a bunch of stuff

01:10.840 --> 01:13.360
we're going to be giving away. So stay till the end. I'm going

01:13.360 --> 01:17.600
to pack the training, going to make this really a value field

01:17.600 --> 01:21.040
and we're going to try to end this in 55 minutes. I also want

01:21.040 --> 01:25.400
to let you guys know, you know, what the what the transition is

01:25.400 --> 01:29.600
because the free group is no more. OK, so Porter, you could

01:29.600 --> 01:32.560
still hear me. We're good where everything's good. Yep, we're

01:32.560 --> 01:35.760
good. OK, I want you to monitor the comments. I've also got

01:35.760 --> 01:38.680
Ashley watching live because when we do the giveaways, I want

01:38.680 --> 01:42.120
her to take notes, even though she isn't on this live that you

01:42.120 --> 01:44.280
can see. She's there. She's watching about a whole team

01:44.280 --> 01:50.200
watching. So, guys, let's get into it. This group, the Art of

01:50.200 --> 01:53.120
Digital Real Estate. And by the way, it was called the Art of

01:53.160 --> 01:56.680
Pre-selling before. As you guys know it right now, it will never

01:56.680 --> 01:59.600
be the same as of today. OK, but today I'm going to show you

01:59.600 --> 02:02.680
guys where it's going and how you can be a part of it, too, if

02:02.680 --> 02:05.280
you choose. But we're also going to be doing the training. That's

02:05.280 --> 02:07.440
the main thing is the training, the giveaways. But I do want to

02:07.440 --> 02:09.680
let you guys know where this is going, because this is not going

02:09.680 --> 02:15.760
to be the same as it was this morning. OK, so in addition to

02:15.760 --> 02:17.280
the training, guys, here's what we're going to be doing. We're

02:17.280 --> 02:21.040
going to be giving away two to two different people. We're

02:21.040 --> 02:24.760
going to be giving away three free months of three free a

02:24.760 --> 02:28.080
three free month membership to Rankin and Ningen. We're going to

02:28.080 --> 02:32.240
be giving away five copies of a 12 part exclusive training

02:32.240 --> 02:35.960
series that I did a few months back. We had some amazing

02:35.960 --> 02:39.080
topics. One of the one of the trainings, we had some

02:39.080 --> 02:41.720
incredible feedback. People, to my knowledge, people actually

02:41.720 --> 02:45.120
made money from this specific training. So there's 12. It's

02:45.120 --> 02:47.600
like 12 hours long. You're going to get we've got five

02:47.600 --> 02:49.560
different people are going to get copies of that. We're going

02:49.560 --> 02:52.160
to give away 10 pieces of merchandise, coffee mugs, t

02:52.160 --> 02:55.520
shirts, mouse pads. And then guys, we're also going to give

02:55.520 --> 02:59.640
away one, not a full but a partial scholarship to digital

02:59.640 --> 03:04.400
landlords. OK. Also, just as a reminder, anybody that stays

03:04.400 --> 03:08.680
till the end of this training is going to get a copy of this

03:08.680 --> 03:10.400
training. I'm going to let you know how to do that. We got to

03:10.400 --> 03:13.720
stay till the end to get those instructions. Again, guys, 53

03:13.720 --> 03:15.120
minutes. We're going to buzz through this as quickly as

03:15.120 --> 03:19.280
possible. Guys, it's been an amazing ride. It's been over 150

03:19.280 --> 03:23.160
plus weeks of me pouring my heart and soul into this group.

03:23.360 --> 03:27.400
And I literally mean that. OK, let me give you guys really,

03:27.400 --> 03:31.720
really quick. Just a quick background on this group. OK, I

03:31.720 --> 03:36.240
started it back in September of 2021. This was after I had my

03:36.240 --> 03:39.120
very, you know, I had my first year of making seven figures

03:39.320 --> 03:43.560
renting simple websites in 2020. Then I had another year. We did

03:43.560 --> 03:49.640
like 1.4, 1.45 in 2021. And guys, what ended up happening is

03:49.640 --> 03:52.440
I was sharing my journey, which I encourage you guys to do the

03:52.440 --> 03:55.320
same. I was in other groups. I was sharing my journey in this

03:55.320 --> 03:58.440
specific group. And I started getting people that would send

03:58.440 --> 04:01.200
me messages. They would say, you know, Nick, how did you close

04:01.200 --> 04:03.760
this deal up front? How did you, you know, Nick, how did you

04:03.760 --> 04:06.600
scale to 100, 100K? That's insane. I didn't know anyone

04:06.600 --> 04:08.960
could do that. Nick, my business owner keeps complaining about

04:08.960 --> 04:12.000
the price. What is it? All these different questions. And at the

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
time, I didn't, you know, I had never had this happen. So it was

04:15.000 --> 04:18.680
kind of fun. It was exciting. I felt I felt like my ego was

04:18.680 --> 04:21.480
stroked a bit. And so two to three times a week, I would

04:21.480 --> 04:23.920
spend after my day was done. It was I remember it was at

04:23.920 --> 04:27.160
nighttime. My kids were asleep. I would spend 30 to 60 minutes

04:27.160 --> 04:30.080
in the evening, opening the messages, turning on the camera,

04:30.240 --> 04:35.560
responding to them directly. OK. But guys, eventually, I started

04:35.560 --> 04:37.640
getting the same questions again and again and again. And I

04:37.640 --> 04:40.480
realized, you know, I'm doing this is being I'm being stupid.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.320
Let me put everybody in a free group. And then when the

04:43.320 --> 04:46.200
question is asked, I'll just answer it once. And then

04:46.200 --> 04:49.080
everybody can come and they can they can look at the answer,

04:49.080 --> 04:52.120
right? Three years from now, you guys can go and look at answers

04:52.120 --> 04:54.480
and questions that were asked three years ago. And that was

04:54.480 --> 04:57.640
the entire goal. And so that's exactly what I did, guys. Three

04:57.640 --> 05:01.400
over three years, three years and five months ago. And I

05:01.400 --> 05:04.760
remember, guys, like I was doing everything at the beginning, I

05:04.760 --> 05:07.280
was answering all the questions. I was also running my agency. I

05:07.280 --> 05:09.960
was going live. I was doing all this kind of stuff. And I was

05:09.960 --> 05:13.200
literally responding to every single question. I wouldn't let

05:13.200 --> 05:16.480
a single notification pass by. So if you guys have ever heard of

05:16.480 --> 05:20.960
Fix It Felix, our our admin, which does a phenomenal job. I

05:20.960 --> 05:23.840
was Fix It Felix. OK, then we had somebody that came in and

05:23.840 --> 05:26.520
helped. And then I hired somebody to help. But I was

05:26.520 --> 05:28.640
Fix It Felix in the beginning. And that's just that's just how

05:28.640 --> 05:32.080
it was. And it was it was super exciting. But it just wasn't

05:32.080 --> 05:35.760
scalable. OK, guys, I've gone live over 150 times in this

05:35.760 --> 05:39.080
group, sharing everything that I know and holding nothing back.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.240
But what I've realized is as time has gone on, guys, I've

05:42.240 --> 05:46.800
seen that people they've stopped appreciating what I'm doing.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.360
And I'm not saying I need to be appreciated. But the sizzle is

05:50.360 --> 05:52.800
gone. You know, when you send a business owner, Porter, you

05:52.800 --> 05:54.240
know what I'm talking about? You send a business owner, those

05:54.240 --> 05:56.520
first couple leads are super stoked. And then if you let it

05:56.520 --> 05:59.840
go on too long, they kind of get entitled. Can't send them too

05:59.840 --> 06:03.160
many. You can't send them too many. Right. People stop showing

06:03.160 --> 06:05.440
up to the lives, guys. And I tried all kinds of stuff. I tried

06:05.440 --> 06:09.000
to do them on Zoom. I tried to do a cap to number all kinds of

06:09.000 --> 06:11.680
different stuff. And what I've just seen is a lot of people

06:11.680 --> 06:14.320
have just become parasites, not producers. And I'm not speaking

06:14.320 --> 06:17.640
to all of you, but a lot of people that has happened to. And

06:17.640 --> 06:21.600
so, guys, I want I want to ask you guys, some of you guys are

06:21.600 --> 06:24.880
going to be a little bit. I think I even had an Instagram

06:24.880 --> 06:28.600
message from somebody that I had been talking to. In fact,

06:28.600 --> 06:30.400
somebody that had been on one of the lives with us asked a

06:30.400 --> 06:33.040
question. He's like, well, blah, blah, blah. You're changing the

06:33.040 --> 06:36.040
group. And I didn't just rub me wrong. And I said, dude, same

06:36.360 --> 06:40.600
thing. Guys, if you're sending a business owner free leads, OK,

06:40.800 --> 06:43.080
you guys talk about, hey, we're going to have a conversation.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.800
I'm going to send you free leads, blah, blah, blah, blah,

06:44.800 --> 06:48.200
blah. You send them three to five leads. You hop on a sales

06:48.200 --> 06:51.400
call. You do the whole process and they tell you, you know

06:51.400 --> 06:55.560
what? I think I can do this better on my own or I don't think

06:55.560 --> 06:59.080
I need to pay you. I can just do it on my own. OK, we've all had

06:59.080 --> 07:02.080
that happen. Porter, have you had that happen? Yeah. And it's

07:02.080 --> 07:04.440
going to happen again. But the question is, are you going to

07:04.440 --> 07:09.360
keep giving that person free leads? Obviously not. Right.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.800
You're not going to do that. You're going to stop sending them

07:11.800 --> 07:14.400
leads. So that's that's what this is, guys. That's all that

07:14.400 --> 07:18.840
this is. But this isn't the what I'm doing, the value that I'm

07:18.840 --> 07:22.840
giving me going live, all this content. It's going to a new

07:22.840 --> 07:25.720
home. But it trust me, this is not going away. It's just

07:25.720 --> 07:28.480
changing. OK, so guys, of course, you wouldn't give it to

07:28.480 --> 07:31.160
them. You want you you would say, OK, good luck, go try it

07:31.160 --> 07:34.200
out. And then once they go and try it out on their own, they're

07:34.200 --> 07:38.200
going to come back and say, hey, yeah, those leads, what do

07:38.200 --> 07:39.720
we got to do to work together? Right. They're going to

07:39.720 --> 07:44.120
appreciate it because now it's gone. OK, so, guys, basically

07:44.120 --> 07:49.080
what I'm saying is the days of free ninety nine, it's done.

07:49.480 --> 07:54.920
OK, the the gravy train is over. You don't value what you don't

07:54.920 --> 07:58.240
pay for. I have a thirty thousand dollar program that

07:58.240 --> 08:01.440
somebody gave me the password to just to go and look at not even

08:01.480 --> 08:04.040
the material, but how they structured it. It is sitting.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.080
I have the password. I have it bookmarked. It is sitting there.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.600
I have spent less than 30 minutes in it because I didn't pay

08:09.600 --> 08:13.640
for it. And that's just what happens. OK, guys, I don't care

08:14.040 --> 08:16.960
what the number of this group is. I know we have six point two

08:16.960 --> 08:20.720
thousand members. Who cares? I don't care if after this live, we

08:20.720 --> 08:24.080
go from six thousand two hundred people to 30 people, because

08:24.080 --> 08:27.560
those 30 people that I'm still seeing are the people that I

08:27.560 --> 08:29.520
want to work with, the people that are serious to the people

08:29.520 --> 08:33.560
that are actually going to take action. OK, so here's the deal.

08:33.760 --> 08:38.320
As of one hour ago, every single training.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.200
Well, I don't think I think we're still working on it as we speak.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.520
But as of one hour ago, I would say 90 percent.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.600
And by the time this is over, by the time the day is done,

08:48.960 --> 08:52.040
every single live training that I have ever done

08:52.680 --> 08:55.400
personally has been deleted from the group.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.960
OK, I've gone live over 150 times.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.760
I've interviewed over 100 people.

09:00.760 --> 09:03.840
Everything that I've ever done in this group personally

09:04.280 --> 09:06.120
has been wiped. OK, it's gone.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.400
It's done. And it is no more.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.600
It's it's it's just gone. OK.

09:11.520 --> 09:15.480
And there are over the next, you know, there might be a few interviews

09:15.480 --> 09:17.520
still that we're trying to pull down, whatever.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.160
But over the next few days, you're going to see everything disappear.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.040
The gravy train is over.

09:22.040 --> 09:25.480
And I want to work with the serious people only.

09:25.760 --> 09:29.080
OK, so with that said, guys, what I'm going to do,

09:29.080 --> 09:32.600
I'm going to spend three minutes, five minutes tops.

09:32.840 --> 09:37.040
And I'm going to show you what right what the art of digital

09:37.040 --> 09:40.120
real estate 2.0 looks like really quick.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.880
I'm going to share my screen and how you can be a part of it.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.040
And then we're going to get into the training, going to get into the giveaways

09:45.320 --> 09:47.960
and leave you guys with a ton of value, give you guys the copies,

09:47.960 --> 09:49.960
the replays for those of you that stay till the end.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.280
And we're going to go from there.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.320
So let me just do this really quick, Porter.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.960
I'm still good on the the volume.

09:55.640 --> 09:56.840
Yep, I can hear you perfect.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.640
All right, guys, I want to present to you.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.520
This is something I'm super stoked about this, guys.

10:01.760 --> 10:06.000
I want to present to you version 2.0.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.800
Let me just make sure I got this right. Hold on.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.760
I don't want to be sharing anything just yet.

10:09.760 --> 10:12.280
Let's make sure everything's good. OK.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.240
Yes. OK, let me go ahead and get rid of this.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.560
Guys, so with that said, I want to introduce you guys

10:20.560 --> 10:23.240
to the rank and rent academy.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.520
OK, that is where we are transitioning.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.120
I'm going to show that to you right now as I share my screen.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.720
OK, Porter, can you see my screen?

10:32.560 --> 10:33.920
Yeah, I can see it perfectly.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.040
Guys, welcome to the rank and rent academy.

10:36.040 --> 10:39.360
This is a this is where our Facebook group has now gone.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.200
And it is where it is going to be.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.280
I'm going to give you guys a link here in just a moment

10:44.280 --> 10:45.560
if you guys want to check it out.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.480
But I want to just walk you through it really briefly.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.720
Again, three minutes tops.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.560
What we have some introductory videos

10:52.560 --> 10:54.760
and stuff that explain how all this stuff is laid out.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.800
But I want to walk you through the content really quick.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.560
We have over I think it's 15 to 17 mini courses.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.000
They call these mini courses.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.400
You can also view them as modules.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.880
But within each mini course, you're going to see lessons.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.280
By the way, really quick, if you're in digital landlords

11:09.280 --> 11:11.560
and you're freaking out going, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh,

11:11.560 --> 11:13.840
this is not for you, you guys will have access to this.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.600
Do not worry.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.840
We're going to get you guys access to this

11:15.840 --> 11:16.960
because you're part of digital landlords.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.440
So don't be freaking out. You don't need to go whatever.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.240
You're going to have access to this. OK.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.480
But I do want to just show you this.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.280
This is the classroom section.

11:24.280 --> 11:27.080
This we're going to be adding to this every single month,

11:27.200 --> 11:28.560
if not every single week.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.320
I want to show you two of my favorite sections.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.480
But obviously, guys, we talk about mapping your goals,

11:32.680 --> 11:37.480
the mindset, tools, niches, due diligence, SEO, sales, all that kind of stuff.

11:37.760 --> 11:41.080
This is these are two of my favorite mini courses.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.680
Really quick. Number one is the vault.

11:42.680 --> 11:50.000
OK, the vault, guys, is where I am going to be putting all of the library,

11:50.280 --> 11:53.560
all hundred and fifty plus lives that we've done over the past

11:53.880 --> 11:57.440
three and a half years are going to be found in the vault.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.840
Right now, we have six different lives.

12:00.040 --> 12:03.360
And every single week with that, to not overwhelm you guys,

12:03.520 --> 12:06.960
every week, we're going to be adding one to two new lives that we did

12:07.400 --> 12:10.080
back in twenty, twenty one, twenty, twenty two, twenty, twenty three.

12:10.240 --> 12:14.040
We're just going to be stacking this vault with every bit of content.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.480
OK, that module is going to be packed.

12:16.520 --> 12:20.480
That, I guess, mini course is going to be packed with all kinds of training,

12:20.640 --> 12:25.880
all kinds of stuff from ads to, you know, how much should this.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.720
I mean, every nuanced topic you could possibly think about.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.080
OK, that's that one.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.800
The other one I want to show you guys is this, the interview series.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.680
This is where I have interviewed over a hundred.

12:35.680 --> 12:39.200
I think it's maybe even over 200 people, people just like you,

12:39.200 --> 12:42.280
people from all walks of life, moms, dads, single moms, single dads,

12:42.560 --> 12:45.960
people with speech impediments, people with accents, people with

12:46.960 --> 12:49.680
no sales experience, people with no technical experience,

12:49.680 --> 12:52.000
people that are retired, people that are young,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.440
all kinds of different walks of life where I've interviewed them

12:54.440 --> 12:58.520
and I've gleaned and I've tried to pull out what has helped them to be successful.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.640
And we're going to have all those interviews inside of here.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.040
Again, we're going to be adding, I think we have six in there right now.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.840
And we're just slowly adding every single week.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.080
We're going to be adding new interviews.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.360
I don't want to just I didn't just want to throw everything in there

13:09.360 --> 13:11.000
and just the vomit on you guys.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.920
I want you guys to catch up on all the content.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.520
And then every week you have like a little goody to watch a little

13:16.040 --> 13:17.680
45 minute to an hour

13:19.120 --> 13:21.320
vault video as well as the interview series.

13:21.320 --> 13:25.160
OK, because also we have the replays, a bunch of different stuff.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.600
Another thing I want to show you guys that's really, really cool

13:27.600 --> 13:31.440
is we have this community world map where you're going to be able to see

13:31.800 --> 13:35.640
where every single person that's in this community is, where

13:35.760 --> 13:38.920
let's say you guys go on a little vacation to Vegas for your buddy's

13:38.920 --> 13:41.280
bachelor party, you're like, hey, while I'm in Vegas, I want to spend,

13:41.600 --> 13:45.440
you know, an hour on Tuesday and try to link up with somebody else

13:45.440 --> 13:47.600
that's in the space, go grab lunch, go grab coffee.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.880
You can jump on the community world map, go in, find them as a member,

13:50.880 --> 13:52.960
send them a message and link up.

13:52.960 --> 13:55.840
Guys, the community, this is this is what I've realized.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.680
I've bought twenty three thousand dollars plus in courses

13:58.680 --> 14:00.800
just related to rank and rent.

14:00.800 --> 14:06.080
I always watch the the the course, you know, once maybe a year.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.520
But I'm in the community every single day.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.800
I've literally made I have two partners right now

14:12.080 --> 14:14.200
that I've made from my community.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.880
I have I've made I've had deals come out of it.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.040
I've had friendships come out of it.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.880
I've had all kinds of stuff that have come out of it.

14:20.880 --> 14:24.480
So the community, guys, is is where I think the value of these.

14:24.480 --> 14:28.000
And ironically, school calls these communities, but it's a group.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.840
That is where I think the value is.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.840
OK, so obviously, you can have the community aspect.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.080
You're going to have the classroom.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.240
You're going to have the community world map.

14:35.240 --> 14:38.720
And then every single week, you can notice on the calendar.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.320
I am going to be going live every single week.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.240
Porter, can you see this on my screen?

14:43.240 --> 14:46.240
Yep, I guess every single Monday to start the week, seven a.m.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.800
I put it as a Q&A, but sometimes it's going to be training,

14:48.800 --> 14:51.640
sometimes going to be Q&A every single Monday.

14:51.760 --> 14:52.880
Me, I'm going to be live.

14:52.880 --> 14:53.920
I'm going to be talking to you guys.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.080
Any questions that you have, we're going to be going on to a live.

14:56.280 --> 15:00.040
And the other thing, too, is all those lives are going to be put into

15:00.400 --> 15:03.200
the replay section in case you can't catch it.

15:03.240 --> 15:06.840
OK, so guys, there's a ton of other stuff.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.880
I don't want to bore you with all the details,

15:09.200 --> 15:12.120
but this is the Rankin Red Academy.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.720
I've been working on this for months.

15:13.720 --> 15:14.800
We're like, where do we transition?

15:14.800 --> 15:16.400
What do we do? What do we do?

15:16.400 --> 15:19.320
And this is it, by the way, all of the material in here.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.080
Let me give you a little sample.

15:21.080 --> 15:26.720
Let's go to let's go to the map your goal section, for example.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.920
All of these videos that are in here, OK,

15:31.400 --> 15:33.960
every single one of these videos, this is not training

15:33.960 --> 15:35.680
that I pulled from somewhere else.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.680
These are all new videos.

15:38.560 --> 15:42.600
OK, this is all new content that I have produced for this community.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.080
So all of this is new stuff.

15:45.080 --> 15:49.160
OK, so that said, guys, that is where this is going.

15:49.160 --> 15:52.960
The art of digital real estate, RIP, it was real.

15:53.240 --> 15:56.320
Now we are moving into the

15:56.320 --> 15:58.160
Rankin Red Academy.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.680
And if you guys want to check that out, I'm going to go ahead

16:00.680 --> 16:04.280
and just drop a little linky poo, by the way, just so you guys know

16:04.640 --> 16:05.840
our plan with this.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.440
I didn't even mention this, by the way, this is paid, by the way.

16:09.440 --> 16:12.640
Our goal is we're going to be charging 100 bucks a month.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.040
This is a this is it's a community.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.480
So you pay every month.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.320
But the introductory rate, what we're doing for this launch

16:18.320 --> 16:19.400
is we're doing at half price.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.400
We're doing at $50 per month. OK.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.600
Now, one of the thing you need to know, that's why you digital

16:23.600 --> 16:25.520
landlord students, don't worry, you're going to get access

16:26.240 --> 16:28.760
any money that you spend. OK.

16:29.800 --> 16:33.480
Any money you spend on the Rankin Red Academy,

16:33.480 --> 16:35.760
we're going to take 20 percent of that money

16:36.040 --> 16:39.160
and we're going to credit that toward you,

16:39.840 --> 16:41.840
towards your digital landlords membership

16:41.840 --> 16:44.360
when you decide to jump into digital landlords. OK.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.320
So if you're in for a year, we'll take 20 percent of that.

16:47.320 --> 16:51.080
That will be a discounted rate off of your digital landlord membership.

16:51.080 --> 16:56.120
So you're you being in this is you're in a way kind of paying towards that,

16:56.120 --> 16:58.840
which you'll eventually join, we hope, at some point. OK.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.760
So that's it, Isaac Cheatham.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.800
What's the main difference between this?

17:03.800 --> 17:05.960
Isaac Cheatham, you have access to this, so don't worry about it.

17:05.960 --> 17:09.120
This is this is the this is the beginner.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.400
This is the free group.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.680
This is basically the free group.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.760
We're going to have the community.

17:12.760 --> 17:13.920
We're going to have the training.

17:13.920 --> 17:17.000
But we're not touching on anything that's in digital landlords.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.800
So the difference is everything.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.200
So in case anyone's like, well, I'll just get into this.

17:21.360 --> 17:23.360
No, this is very different than digital landlords.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.040
But this is basically the free group on steroids.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.360
We're going to give it attention.

17:27.360 --> 17:30.480
We're going to be having, you know, Porter and Jason are going to be in there

17:30.480 --> 17:32.640
giving the the free coaching calls.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.240
If you guys want to jump on those,

17:34.240 --> 17:36.880
we're going to be doing giveaways, new trainings all the time.

17:37.120 --> 17:42.000
But Isaac, this is nothing, nothing the same as digital landlords.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.080
OK, this is like this is where you start.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.800
This is the free group. Move to this. OK.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.040
But you get access anyway, so it doesn't matter.

17:49.040 --> 17:52.240
So here we go.

17:52.240 --> 17:56.360
Rankinretire.com.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.080
Easy peasy. Porter, you want to try that link?

18:00.080 --> 18:02.200
Rankinretire.com.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.440
And then, guys, we're going to get into the actual training.

18:04.440 --> 18:05.760
We're done.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.240
Hold on one second.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.400
Make sure that work that post.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.040
Yep, got it. Beautiful.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.480
Let's make sure it goes to the old community.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.160
And there it goes.

18:15.160 --> 18:18.320
OK, let me just see if I can pin this.

18:19.320 --> 18:22.040
Chris Aren't said people appreciate what they pay for.

18:22.040 --> 18:22.960
Yes, 100 percent.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.840
By the way, Chris, Isaac, those of you that are in digital landlords,

18:26.080 --> 18:27.840
do not be afraid, my friends.

18:27.840 --> 18:28.960
You guys have access to this.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.640
I'm going to be working with the team to figure out how we give you access

18:31.640 --> 18:32.520
so you don't have to pay.

18:32.520 --> 18:35.280
So none of you digital landlords go and try to pay, please.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.280
For everybody else, if you want to be inside the community,

18:38.640 --> 18:40.360
it is $50 per month right now.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.520
Again, 20 percent of that is going to be credited

18:42.520 --> 18:45.320
towards your digital landlords membership when you make the jump. OK.

18:46.400 --> 18:50.040
All right. And by the way, funny enough, Isaac asked what the difference is.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.560
I literally have a note right here.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.360
This is not digital landlords, guys.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.480
We're not teaching the same stuff at digital landlords.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.640
Don't expect to go in and learn, you know, exactly what digital

18:58.640 --> 19:00.520
landlords students are learning.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.880
This is an intro to the rank and run.

19:01.880 --> 19:04.440
This is a community, this access to myself, my team, et cetera.

19:04.440 --> 19:08.720
But I will tell you guys, there is going to be a ton of value in that vault.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.560
OK, a ton of value in that vault.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.120
You guys are going to be able to pull from that.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.440
Just that one mini course.

19:14.440 --> 19:17.560
So just so you guys know, that's that.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.720
Welcome to the rank and run academy.

19:20.040 --> 19:23.960
And guys, one more thing I want to mention, anybody that jumps in today,

19:24.280 --> 19:28.240
I went into my vault, which is like all my old videos

19:28.560 --> 19:32.200
of all my, you know, my old sales calls that I flopped, my new sales,

19:32.320 --> 19:34.800
you know, all that kind of stuff from way back in the day.

19:35.040 --> 19:39.120
And I found this closed sales call back in 2018

19:39.480 --> 19:44.800
that anybody that joins today, I'm going to I'm going to share this with you guys.

19:44.800 --> 19:45.960
I'm going to let you guys have this.

19:45.960 --> 19:49.600
It's like a 33 minute video of a closed sales call I did back in 2018.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.840
That's going to be included for anybody that joins today as well.

19:52.880 --> 19:57.160
OK, so anybody that stays at all is going to get the replay of this.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.480
We're also going to be doing the giveaways.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.960
We're going to be doing the training now.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.840
And then anybody that joins, we're going to be giving away the

20:02.840 --> 20:06.880
you're going to also get the sales, the sales recording that did back in 2018.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.800
OK, rank and retired dot com.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.640
Check it out. That is the rank and run academy.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.480
And guys, with that said, let's get into the training.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.680
Porter, what are you at right now per month?

20:18.840 --> 20:22.400
I'm almost 11K, actually, right now.

20:23.320 --> 20:26.520
Ten, one, ten, ten, one, ten, ten, ten, seven right now.

20:26.760 --> 20:29.600
Amazing. OK, by the way,

20:29.600 --> 20:32.040
we got to get you to 20 quick, just so you know.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.920
Welcome, Dylan, first join.

20:33.920 --> 20:36.320
So, Dylan, welcome to the community.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.560
Welcome to Rankin Academy for being the first join.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.080
I think, Ashley, we need to hook him up with something special.

20:43.400 --> 20:47.200
So, Ashley, why don't you send him some swag?

20:47.240 --> 20:48.880
Let's send him some swag out of the deal store

20:48.880 --> 20:50.400
since he was the first one to make the leap.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.960
Welcome, Dylan.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.840
So let's get into the training, guys.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.400
I want to I want to give you guys some real value as I go out here.

20:57.160 --> 21:00.240
Last live, it's one twenty five in the morning.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.320
It's been a long three days.

21:02.320 --> 21:03.960
I've been working my tail off.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.440
I'm in the middle of West Africa.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.120
I should be going and enjoying nature and checking all this kind of stuff out.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.760
I've just been working because I wanted to get this thing launched

21:10.760 --> 21:13.080
as soon as possible.

21:13.080 --> 21:16.840
So let's get into this this training and then we'll do the giveaways. OK.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.120
So, guys, here's what I did this training.

21:19.120 --> 21:22.360
We're going to be talking about how to go from zero to 20K per month

21:22.680 --> 21:25.000
in 2025 with digital real estate.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.440
And that's if I had to start over today.

21:26.440 --> 21:30.680
So if you told me, hey, Nick, you know, you're at zero.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.600
Like you're literally at no money.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.160
I'm going to take everything away.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.040
I'm going to take away all your clients.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.080
You can't call your old clients.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.360
What would you do?

21:39.360 --> 21:42.640
And I sat there when I was preparing this, which I've spent a lot of time

21:42.640 --> 21:44.920
just preparing this this part right here.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.720
And I thought, what would I really do if I was sitting,

21:48.720 --> 21:50.400
let's say, with Porter and he asked me this question?

21:50.400 --> 21:51.920
What would actually what I do?

21:51.920 --> 21:53.840
Not what what sounds good. What would I do?

21:53.840 --> 21:57.600
So before I get into it, I've got like a few things.

21:57.600 --> 21:58.920
I just want to I'm going to buzz through them.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.200
And then any questions you guys have, we're going to we're going to go into that, too.

22:01.600 --> 22:05.120
Porter, if you were to do that today, let's say you were going from zero to 10K.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.160
Everything taken away.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.080
You know, obviously, your skill set, your knowledge is there,

22:11.080 --> 22:12.600
but all your clients are taken away.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.520
What's the very first thing you would do? Just curious.

22:15.520 --> 22:16.560
I would set my goals.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.600
I would map out how many.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.240
Well, I pick one niche, first of all, or two niches,

22:21.600 --> 22:23.240
because I think simplicity is best.

22:23.240 --> 22:26.640
I would I would set my goal and figure out

22:26.640 --> 22:28.960
how many campaigns I needed to run every single month

22:28.960 --> 22:31.600
and how many closing calls I would need to do every single month

22:32.160 --> 22:34.240
to make sure it happens with a little bit of a buffer.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.520
And then I would just simplify it.

22:37.520 --> 22:40.560
I would just completely simplify the whole process.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.800
Just pick one or two niches just to scale it and not try to overcomplicate it.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.160
I love it, dude. I love it. Keep it simple.

22:46.920 --> 22:49.000
Real quick, I got my comments over here on the phone.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.840
Not to jump, but actually keep track of this.

22:52.160 --> 22:54.840
Isaac Cheatham, he needs a coffee cup.

22:55.640 --> 22:56.640
He needs a coffee cup.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.240
He's one of the swag winners. Done.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.640
Give him a coffee mug, man.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.040
Give Isaac Cheatham a coffee mug.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.000
Thanks for asking, brother.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.760
And now everyone's going to ask for a coffee mug.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.720
But Isaac, first winner of the swag.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.720
OK, I like that, dude.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.320
I like that. Sounds sounds simple.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.520
And guys, I don't ever think you want to overcomplicate this.

23:13.880 --> 23:17.240
So I'm going to go through what I would do,

23:17.240 --> 23:19.440
and then I'm going to kind of set it back on Porter as well.

23:19.440 --> 23:22.320
By the way, if you guys don't know, Porter isn't just on here because he's my brother.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.720
He's on here because he's at 10.

23:24.720 --> 23:26.560
You said 10, what, 10, 7?

23:26.560 --> 23:27.920
Yeah, 10, 700 now.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.200
Ten thousand seven hundred dollars a month.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.440
He's also working on the farm.

23:30.440 --> 23:33.040
When I talked to him today, we're doing WhatsApp.

23:33.040 --> 23:36.400
He was actually doing farm stuff in the middle of making calls.

23:36.400 --> 23:39.760
Like, even though he does that part time, he does it full time in the summer.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.520
And then I feel like part time.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.440
I feel like this year you've worked more than you did.

23:43.440 --> 23:44.720
Even last year.

23:44.720 --> 23:45.720
Oh, yeah, by far.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.680
And I've done way better. It's crazy.

23:47.680 --> 23:50.840
Yeah, I feel like you just do better when you're it's honest.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.040
It's the truth.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.240
So here's what I would do, guys.

23:53.240 --> 23:57.360
Step number one, if I was starting from zero, zero to 20K.

23:57.760 --> 24:02.000
Step number one is and this may sound like I'm going from the very beginning

24:02.000 --> 24:05.320
or I'm going a bit back, but this is literally I would do this before anything.

24:05.680 --> 24:11.520
Number one is I would figure out why I wanted the 20K. OK.

24:12.480 --> 24:16.360
Why? Why? Like, why do I actually want to make 20K?

24:16.360 --> 24:18.400
And I know it sounds silly, whatever.

24:18.880 --> 24:23.440
But for me, when everything everything changed for me in 2020.

24:24.280 --> 24:28.720
Because in 2019, I sat down with a pen and a paper and I asked myself,

24:29.040 --> 24:32.080
what do you want? Number one, which I said, 100K a month.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.760
And then I asked the most important question, which was why?

24:35.640 --> 24:37.360
And I answered, why do I want that?

24:37.360 --> 24:40.960
And then that answer, I asked why again, and I went like seven layers deep.

24:41.680 --> 24:45.640
And guys, I can tell you when I figured out exactly why I wanted that money,

24:46.200 --> 24:49.520
I realized that it wasn't even the reason that I originally thought.

24:49.960 --> 24:55.160
But every time that, you know, things got tough or I got tired or whatever

24:55.160 --> 24:57.240
it was, it was Wednesday.

24:57.240 --> 25:00.320
I just it was easy to remember my wife.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.360
And I was very clear about it.

25:02.360 --> 25:06.200
So if I was starting today, before I did anything, before I chose my niche,

25:06.200 --> 25:09.480
before I chose my city, before I map my goals, first thing I'm doing

25:09.640 --> 25:11.640
is I'm sitting down going, why do I want 20K?

25:12.600 --> 25:14.040
What what what do I need? 20K?

25:14.040 --> 25:15.960
Why is it not 25? Why is it not 30?

25:15.960 --> 25:18.240
Why is it not 15? What's the 20K for?

25:18.240 --> 25:19.600
Why is it important to me?

25:19.600 --> 25:21.040
And that's the first thing I do.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.480
OK, step number two, guys.

25:23.480 --> 25:26.320
Again, and this is coming from somebody who went from

25:27.280 --> 25:32.280
barely making like barely scraping by eight to 10K a month back in 2019.

25:33.400 --> 25:37.840
To in July of 2020, doing a hundred thousand dollars per month.

25:38.320 --> 25:39.880
And some of these are the same steps.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.760
And some of this I didn't do, which I wish I would have.

25:41.760 --> 25:45.440
OK, step number two for me would be eliminate everything from my life

25:45.440 --> 25:46.800
that doesn't get me closer to that goal.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.520
And the goal being 20K.

25:50.520 --> 25:54.200
I heard her Mosey her Mosey say this, I watched it.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.960
I don't I haven't watched a ton of his stuff in the last year,

25:57.320 --> 26:00.880
but I did watch something recently and he said he said this and it stuck with me.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.400
And I've shared it in digital landlords as well.

26:02.400 --> 26:06.840
It says, ask yourself the following question every single time this year.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.360
Does this and guys, write this down.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.040
This isn't from me.

26:10.040 --> 26:14.960
This is from somebody that's way smarter, way richer, way more business savvy.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.160
And I love this question.

26:17.160 --> 26:20.840
Does this thing, person or belief

26:21.800 --> 26:24.920
make it less or more likely that I hit my goal?

26:26.480 --> 26:28.960
Anything you do, anything you do,

26:28.960 --> 26:31.600
getting ready to go out with the boys and hit some drinks.

26:32.160 --> 26:37.080
Does this thing, person, belief make it more or less likely that I hit my goals?

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
OK. Getting ready to go on a vacation midweek.

26:42.360 --> 26:45.880
Same question. Getting ready, you know, whatever it is.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.320
Ask yourself that lunch that you got invited to.

26:49.320 --> 26:50.480
Is it getting your close?

26:50.480 --> 26:52.080
Is it getting you closer to your goal?

26:52.080 --> 26:54.160
Is the belief getting you closer to your goal?

26:54.160 --> 26:57.560
Is the is the person that you're around getting you closer to your goal?

26:57.560 --> 26:59.320
If not, cut it.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.360
OK, if you assuming that you want to hit the goal,

27:01.360 --> 27:03.720
that would be the plan here, right, is I want to hit the 20K.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.720
OK, step number three for me, guys, is then I would sit down

27:08.000 --> 27:12.200
and I would set the date and create an exact roadmap for how to get there.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.480
Now, I will say this inside of the RankinRant Academy

27:16.440 --> 27:18.600
in the map your goals section.

27:18.920 --> 27:24.200
That's exactly what I walk through of how to set that exact date, target

27:24.360 --> 27:26.840
and how to how to create that map of how to get there.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.120
And I'm not just talking about like a loose map.

27:29.120 --> 27:34.720
I'm talking, OK, I want to break it down by quarter, month, week, day, everything.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.080
How many deals am I going to need to close?

27:37.080 --> 27:40.640
How many people am I going to need to pitch to get that many pitches? Right.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.040
Sorry, how many people am I going to need to pitch to close that many deals?

27:45.360 --> 27:48.560
How many business owners am I going to need to put on trial to get that many pitches

27:48.920 --> 27:53.840
all the way down to how many due diligence am I going to need to actually do? OK.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.120
That would be steps.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.680
I think that was step three, right? Step three.

27:58.680 --> 28:02.200
Step four, by the way, for those of you that are trying to scribble,

28:02.200 --> 28:03.640
just stay to the end. I'll extend you to replay.

28:03.640 --> 28:06.440
OK, step number four is I would pick.

28:06.440 --> 28:08.560
I know I've told you guys in the past, pick one.

28:08.560 --> 28:13.360
I would pick three boring, tried and true niches

28:14.040 --> 28:16.480
that I was going to focus on exclusively.

28:16.480 --> 28:19.400
I would just out the gate, pick three.

28:19.400 --> 28:22.680
You know, and if I was going to start today without saying anything else,

28:22.680 --> 28:25.240
Porter, if you're going to start today, what are the three niches you'd pick?

28:25.880 --> 28:28.200
I know one of them is fencing.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.000
Fencing, concrete and masonry.

28:31.000 --> 28:31.920
There you go.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.520
So from somebody who is really trying to get it this year,

28:35.520 --> 28:38.760
who's really trying to get to your goals, 25K by the end of the year.

28:39.360 --> 28:42.040
Yeah, and I've gotten two niches and most of them are concrete.

28:42.640 --> 28:43.600
Most are concrete.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.640
He's getting you're in concrete and fencing.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.000
Yeah, homies at ten thousand seven hundred dollars a month.

28:48.000 --> 28:48.720
He's in two niches.

28:48.720 --> 28:51.240
One of them, you guys think, is oversaturated.

28:51.240 --> 28:53.920
It is it is harder than it was.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.000
Fencing is a great one.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Masonry is a great one.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.400
OK, there's a lot of good niches go into three.

29:00.400 --> 29:03.880
So I would go and pick three boring, tried and true niches

29:03.880 --> 29:06.720
that I was going to focus on exclusively. OK.

29:07.760 --> 29:11.160
Step five is I would go and I would set.

29:11.160 --> 29:13.840
Well, you know, this is a step that you don't have to do.

29:14.200 --> 29:18.320
But the next step is the due diligence process, where what I would do

29:18.320 --> 29:23.160
is I would go in and crank out as many due diligence as I could possibly find

29:23.880 --> 29:25.320
as I could possibly do.

29:25.320 --> 29:27.680
I will tell you guys this just to give a little plug

29:27.680 --> 29:31.320
for the rank and rent engine tool is knowing what I know now.

29:31.320 --> 29:34.560
I would immediately go and fricking set up an account with rank

29:34.560 --> 29:37.200
and rent engine just for the due diligence,

29:37.600 --> 29:40.480
because you're going to be able to do due diligence in seven minutes

29:40.480 --> 29:42.960
instead of 30. And you can do due diligence.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.040
You can do four in a time.

29:44.040 --> 29:47.480
You could do one and you can crank out way more due diligence.

29:47.480 --> 29:50.640
So for me, knowing what I know now, I'd go set up an account.

29:50.640 --> 29:51.600
I'd get the discount code.

29:51.600 --> 29:52.920
It's like 69. What is it?

29:52.920 --> 29:56.440
69 bucks for the starter pack for the first two, three months.

29:56.440 --> 30:00.520
If you get the discount code and you can crank out due diligence like that.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.800
And what I would do, guys, is I would go

30:03.800 --> 30:08.720
and I would find my first five niche and city combinations.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.520
OK, I'd find my first five.

30:12.080 --> 30:15.440
Now, I know I'm deviating a little bit from what I've maybe said in the past.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.960
And by the way, those of you that are that are in digital landlords.

30:18.920 --> 30:23.400
I am in the middle of finishing the training 3.0.

30:23.400 --> 30:27.200
This is the third time I'm going to be creating the new version of digital landlords.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.040
But I'm in the middle of that.

30:28.040 --> 30:29.360
So there's going to be some minor changes.

30:29.360 --> 30:34.360
But I would go and I would find my first five niche and city combinations.

30:34.480 --> 30:37.560
One of the reasons you can do that is because you have tools

30:37.560 --> 30:40.640
like rank and rent engine where you can just bust out due diligence.

30:40.640 --> 30:44.840
OK, now this is one thing I want to I did not do this.

30:45.120 --> 30:47.800
And I really strongly encourage you guys to do this.

30:47.800 --> 30:52.520
Is if I was starting again today, from this point on, I would record everything.

30:53.240 --> 30:58.720
OK, loom Vimeo recording tool.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.640
And I think it's on Google Chrome Store.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.240
Porter, what do you use to record stuff?

31:04.240 --> 31:06.240
A snapshot snapshot.

31:07.880 --> 31:11.400
So it doesn't matter whatever you want to use, record everything.

31:11.400 --> 31:16.000
Why? Because I'm going to hand this off to my VA as soon as possible.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.520
And I can tell you guys in advance, due diligence is one of those things

31:20.520 --> 31:23.560
you are going to want to hand off as soon as possible.

31:23.680 --> 31:27.360
Once you master it, once you get good at it, you're going to want to get somebody else

31:27.360 --> 31:28.480
to be putting in those hours.

31:28.480 --> 31:31.160
OK, so, guys, yes, go find those five niches.

31:31.360 --> 31:33.720
You can do it by hand. By the way, you don't have to use a tool.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.880
Use frickin paper. I don't care.

31:35.880 --> 31:41.400
But record exactly how you're doing the due diligence so that you have a PDF.

31:41.400 --> 31:45.760
I'd have a PDF and I have videos on each one of those steps.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.320
Because then I can hand it off to a VA.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.080
OK, guys, I'm trying to get to 20K.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.120
I'm not trying to get a deal.

31:51.120 --> 31:53.240
I'm not trying to get one deal. I'm trying to get to 20K.

31:53.240 --> 31:54.600
And I think you guys should.

31:54.600 --> 31:58.640
And the reason I chose 20K for this presentation is because at 20K,

31:59.440 --> 32:01.520
most everyone's out of the rat race, right?

32:01.520 --> 32:04.400
I see people on here. I recognize they have all kinds of jobs

32:05.240 --> 32:08.920
for everything from, you know, whatever.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.120
Some people are business owners.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.000
Some people work. They're teachers.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.960
Some people are doctors, whatever it is, guys.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.880
But. At the end of the day,

32:19.440 --> 32:23.600
just just trust me on this one, guys, just record everything.

32:23.960 --> 32:25.440
OK, just record everything.

32:25.440 --> 32:28.960
And at 20K, you can almost anyone can get out of the rat race.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.080
OK, that's that's really what I'm trying to say.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.960
OK, so once I did that, guys, I found my first five

32:33.960 --> 32:36.280
niche city combinations and I recorded everything.

32:36.680 --> 32:41.080
Then what I would do is I would go and set up not one, not two.

32:41.080 --> 32:44.520
I'd go set up three Google ad campaigns.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.480
For three of those five cities, I've chosen five

32:47.480 --> 32:48.960
niche and city combinations.

32:48.960 --> 32:53.200
I'd pick three of them and I'd go set up three campaigns.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.400
And then I would out of those three, I would choose the best two

32:57.640 --> 32:59.920
and I would turn to one.

32:59.920 --> 33:01.680
OK, I turn to one.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.400
And then what I would do is as soon as one started to hit,

33:04.760 --> 33:06.560
I would pause the other.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.920
So now I got one going.

33:07.920 --> 33:11.680
I got two ready to rip ones, pause ones hasn't been started yet.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.560
And I got my first three pop, pop, pop.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.520
OK, done. Just like that.

33:17.560 --> 33:22.640
OK, now, again, guys, which this is one of those things

33:22.640 --> 33:25.120
where I'm telling you what I would do now.

33:26.200 --> 33:30.520
The reason I do it like this is because I know that once I get that first deal,

33:30.520 --> 33:32.840
what everyone does is, Porter, this happened to you.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.560
You got your first deal and then you're like, oh, back to the drawing board.

33:35.720 --> 33:37.600
Now I got to go do due diligence.

33:37.600 --> 33:40.000
And it kind of like slowed you down.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.440
Yeah, I didn't have a plan.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.520
I landed a deal and then I had to go back.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.280
And it took me weeks and weeks and weeks.

33:46.280 --> 33:49.520
And this was I should have been more prepared. Amazing.

33:50.200 --> 33:53.960
So guys, again, record this record how you're setting up ads.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.640
OK, you might not want to hand off ads right at the back.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.120
Like, I don't want to trust a VA.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.840
Just record it because you're going to at some point not going to say

34:00.960 --> 34:04.040
because I don't I haven't set up ads personally in years.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.040
And I'm the one that pays for them.

34:05.040 --> 34:06.480
OK, I have somebody I trust.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.600
Francesca sets them up.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.680
And guess what? I don't even think she sets them up anymore.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.720
I think she oversees somebody else to set them up.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.560
So you're going to have to let the stuff out of control, guys.

34:14.560 --> 34:17.040
I didn't record this stuff for years.

34:17.040 --> 34:19.480
I was doing I was the only one then finally like, oh,

34:19.800 --> 34:21.320
there's this book called The E Myth.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.720
It says I should should create a system.

34:23.720 --> 34:25.360
And then I started I'm just a knucklehead.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.760
I'm trying to give you guys the shortcut here.

34:26.760 --> 34:31.720
OK, so, guys, once I did that, I got the campaign running campaigns running.

34:32.880 --> 34:36.640
I I would then go and build out my list for that city.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.080
OK, now, if you've never done this before,

34:40.080 --> 34:42.880
I would probably recommend that you build the list first

34:42.880 --> 34:45.200
before you even decide to set up the ad.

34:45.200 --> 34:47.280
So, you know, there's business owners.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.520
But for me, because I've done this so many times,

34:49.840 --> 34:50.960
I know what I'm looking for.

34:50.960 --> 34:54.920
I can I can eyeball it and know, you know, hey, this

34:54.920 --> 34:56.640
this has got enough business owners.

34:56.640 --> 34:59.800
And for me, to be honest with you, if I see that there's three business

34:59.800 --> 35:02.840
owners that are paying for ads for me, that's enough.

35:02.920 --> 35:05.560
OK, because I'm really, really confident I'm going to close the deal.

35:05.680 --> 35:08.360
And I know how to show them all the other work I've done, et cetera.

35:08.360 --> 35:10.360
Now, in this scenario, I wouldn't be able to show them that.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.920
But again, guys, I would then go build my list.

35:12.920 --> 35:16.000
If you've never done this before, I'd probably do the list before. OK.

35:16.440 --> 35:20.400
So, guys, now this is where I'm going to change a little bit

35:20.400 --> 35:21.560
from what I've said in the past.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.640
After I built the list, we got the campaign running.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.560
We got to pause campaigns.

35:25.560 --> 35:27.080
We got one one running.

35:27.080 --> 35:30.560
And then the next that we're building, we build the list. Right.

35:30.840 --> 35:32.960
So then, guys, this is where I deviate just a little bit.

35:33.360 --> 35:37.240
What I would do while we're waiting for the ads for the ads to work,

35:37.240 --> 35:42.720
the leads to come in, is I would go and of those two remaining campaigns. OK.

35:44.080 --> 35:47.080
Whatever one is the lowest hanging fruit

35:47.680 --> 35:51.240
with the lowest hanging fruit, like with the city niche combination,

35:51.960 --> 35:56.440
I would actually recommend if I was getting to going to going to go to 20K,

35:56.800 --> 36:01.920
I would actually recommend going and just building your first website.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.560
So while you're waiting, you got, again, just to recap,

36:04.840 --> 36:06.880
you got one that's running ads.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.160
You're waiting for leads to come in.

36:08.160 --> 36:10.120
Of course, leads come in. Focus on that.

36:10.120 --> 36:13.120
You got that. You got to pause ready to rip as soon as you're good.

36:13.520 --> 36:16.000
Then these remaining two, I'd choose one of the two.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.480
I'd actually go build a website.

36:17.480 --> 36:20.480
I've never said that in the past, but I'm starting to realize

36:20.480 --> 36:25.000
that I think a good agency, you've got your you've got your ads.

36:25.200 --> 36:27.960
Those are your quick deals that you're going to go snipe.

36:28.280 --> 36:31.720
And then whenever you come across those city and niche combinations

36:31.720 --> 36:34.960
that are very low hanging fruit, go and build the website.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.160
Because guess what?

36:36.160 --> 36:39.760
Once you close that first deal, you can always run ads to that website.

36:39.760 --> 36:40.720
Now, you got to be careful.

36:40.720 --> 36:44.040
You want to make sure that you're you know what the due diligence looks like.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.560
I would make sure that the one that you build is the one

36:46.560 --> 36:49.760
that's the lowest hanging fruit, because once you build it,

36:49.760 --> 36:51.480
you're kind of stuck with it.

36:51.480 --> 36:55.000
But if you're confident in it, go and build this. Why?

36:55.160 --> 36:57.360
Because now I've got ads running.

36:57.360 --> 36:58.880
I've got to pause.

36:58.880 --> 37:02.200
And I've also got one that's now starting to rank.

37:02.200 --> 37:05.480
And I can be doing work on this while I'm waiting for the leads coming.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.400
I know a lot of people.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.240
They get in.

37:09.720 --> 37:12.880
They set up a campaign and they're like, what do I do now?

37:13.560 --> 37:14.240
What do I do now?

37:14.240 --> 37:16.160
And it's like, well, you go do more due diligence.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.840
Well, I already told you to do five.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.920
Right. So this is a good use of time.

37:20.080 --> 37:22.120
And now, guys, you're going to go build out the website.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.600
And guess what? While you're building out the site,

37:23.600 --> 37:24.520
you know what you're going to do?

37:24.520 --> 37:27.440
You're going to go and you're going to freaking record it.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.160
Right. So you can hand it off to a VA.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.200
Follow me so far.

37:32.200 --> 37:35.680
I got four more things and I'm done. OK, guys, after that,

37:35.680 --> 37:38.200
what I would do is once, of course, I'm sitting here.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.320
The main target is to wait for the leads to come in.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.960
Once the leads start to come in for that first city,

37:43.160 --> 37:45.760
I'd go and I'd close a deal using my process.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.400
If you guys don't know my process by now,

37:47.400 --> 37:49.160
it's because you're brand new to the group.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.000
Go into the Rankin Red Academy.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.680
We outline the entire process in the Money, Love, Speed module.

37:53.800 --> 37:58.320
I would use the my process to close my first deal,

37:58.640 --> 38:00.720
even if it took me three tries.

38:00.720 --> 38:05.440
OK, meaning even if I got leads coming in, I hooked a business owner.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.000
I sent three to five leads.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.920
I got them on the phone. I flubbed the deal. I lost it.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.400
I had to do it again and again, even if it took me three,

38:13.400 --> 38:14.800
even if it took me four or five tries.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.560
We have a guy today inside of our community,

38:18.480 --> 38:20.040
inside of Digital Landlords.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.440
And that kind of a similar thing happened to him.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.760
I think he went through a couple of business owners,

38:24.760 --> 38:27.360
but he had spent a couple of hundred bucks on ads.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.000
But he kept going. He kept going. He got the deal.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.960
Guys, you don't lose money

38:31.960 --> 38:34.360
until you quit running the ads, until you just decide to give up.

38:34.360 --> 38:36.400
OK, so I would again.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.560
That's the main thing.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.800
What's different about what I'm giving you with this approach, guys,

38:39.800 --> 38:43.280
is I already know what's going to happen is if you get that first deal,

38:43.280 --> 38:45.680
you're focusing on one campaign.

38:45.680 --> 38:49.840
Then as soon as you get that deal, you're going to go back to the due diligence.

38:50.480 --> 38:53.360
And it's just like it's it's just this thing.

38:53.480 --> 38:55.560
We're trying to get to 20K as soon as possible.

38:55.560 --> 38:58.480
OK, so I would go, I would close that deal.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.320
I would record every step of the process.

39:00.320 --> 39:03.320
Guys, I'm building out a library for my company handbook.

39:03.480 --> 39:06.240
OK, and then, guys, as soon as I land that first deal,

39:06.520 --> 39:12.680
I just recoup my costs and I would immediately go to onlinejobs.ph.

39:13.360 --> 39:17.160
Shout out plug for John Jonas and his his amazing product.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.880
I would go to onlinejobs.ph

39:19.880 --> 39:24.080
and I'm spending the first money that comes in to get a VA.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.480
No questions asked.

39:26.480 --> 39:29.280
All that stuff, due diligence,

39:29.680 --> 39:33.960
fricking building websites, all that crap that I don't want to do.

39:34.280 --> 39:37.560
I'm I've now got a library of stuff that I've trained them.

39:37.760 --> 39:39.680
That I've I've got these videos on.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.480
I'm just handing this stuff off, man.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.040
I'm not dealing with it. I don't want to deal with it.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.040
I'm trying to get to 20K.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.920
I'm not. Again, the difference between what I'm talking about now,

39:46.920 --> 39:50.080
some of you guys have heard me talk about getting that first deal going,

39:50.320 --> 39:54.720
having a goal of getting to 20K is you're going to structure it differently

39:54.720 --> 39:57.520
than if you have a goal of one K of one deal. Right.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.800
And a lot of people don't think about this,

39:58.800 --> 40:01.880
but this is how I'd get to 20K as soon as possible. OK.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.240
So I'm going to get that VA that first one.

40:04.240 --> 40:05.000
No questions asked.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.480
Don't take the money and start, you know, go go buy clothes.

40:08.960 --> 40:12.560
Put it into a VA recoup your costs on the ads, put it into a VA

40:12.800 --> 40:15.080
and let them go buy back your time.

40:16.080 --> 40:20.200
OK, now what I do is I turn my VA loose on my library

40:20.560 --> 40:25.480
and then I train that person and have them start cranking due diligence

40:25.800 --> 40:29.840
and to also to go build that first website that I that I sold. Right.

40:30.040 --> 40:32.680
So they're going to just be churning out due diligence.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.200
Everything, not everything.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.680
This is when everything changed. But guys,

40:38.160 --> 40:40.680
do before ranking an engine,

40:40.680 --> 40:42.680
how long did it take you to do a due diligence?

40:43.560 --> 40:47.080
It took me like 30 to 45 minutes because I had to go back and forth

40:47.080 --> 40:48.880
and back and forth. It took forever.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.600
I can open up like 15, like 10 to 15 minutes.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.160
Like and I've done it like a couple of times.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.840
Like I could do a lot faster if I did it more. Yeah.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.400
For me, 30 minutes is about what it was.

40:58.400 --> 41:01.040
So imagine I've done over personally over a thousand.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.080
Well, I don't know how much how much time have I spent. Right.

41:04.680 --> 41:08.000
Imagine you can go and get a VA using your rank and rent

41:08.000 --> 41:09.760
engine account and they can bust one out.

41:09.760 --> 41:10.800
Let's say they're not as fast as you.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.800
Let's say there are 12 minutes of rip. Right.

41:13.360 --> 41:14.920
They're they could do almost three.

41:14.920 --> 41:17.880
Let's see. 12. So what they're doing five.

41:17.920 --> 41:19.640
They could do five an hour.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.320
You say four hours a day.

41:21.320 --> 41:24.080
So five times four, you can do 20 a day.

41:24.360 --> 41:28.280
You could do. I mean, dude, you can crank out some due diligence.

41:28.280 --> 41:30.280
You can have them attack some cities. Right.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.920
And so now all of a sudden they're doing due diligence.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.360
They've got a list of these cities.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.200
You're going in, you're making sure that they're good.

41:36.200 --> 41:38.280
And guys, as you close the deal, guess what?

41:38.400 --> 41:40.600
You're turning on the other campaign. Right.

41:40.800 --> 41:43.200
And then that other website, you're setting up the ads.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.960
And now you've got a whole list to do.

41:44.960 --> 41:47.120
And it's just this rinse and repeat cycle.

41:47.560 --> 41:49.560
And the issue is, is everyone's thinking about that.

41:49.560 --> 41:51.240
And guys, the first deal is super important.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.200
That's the best deal ever.

41:52.200 --> 41:55.080
It's it feels it's the most amazing deal ever. Right.

41:55.880 --> 41:59.000
But if we're trying to get to 20K, we've got to we've got to be

41:59.120 --> 42:00.320
going to plan it on 20K.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.840
And that's why I started off by saying set the target,

42:03.280 --> 42:06.000
create the road map and then attack. OK.

42:06.640 --> 42:09.720
And guys, that is exactly the process

42:10.080 --> 42:12.000
that I'm going to be doing until I hit 10K.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.840
I'm going to rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat.

42:15.080 --> 42:18.760
And then when I hit 10K, then I think around 10K

42:18.920 --> 42:21.520
I'm as when I would probably go get my second VA.

42:21.520 --> 42:23.520
You could probably justify it earlier,

42:23.520 --> 42:27.280
but you could get to 10K with a VA and yourself

42:27.920 --> 42:30.440
and a simple tool like Rank and Rent Engine.

42:30.560 --> 42:32.040
That's all you need. OK.

42:32.040 --> 42:33.040
You get to 10K.

42:33.040 --> 42:35.720
And then, guys, what my last step would be, as soon as I hit 10K,

42:35.720 --> 42:37.160
I'd get a second VA.

42:37.160 --> 42:41.200
I would have every single thing that's not making me more money.

42:41.640 --> 42:43.160
I would have my VA's doing.

42:43.160 --> 42:44.800
I'd be managing two VA's.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.640
I'd be spending my time hooking business owners,

42:47.920 --> 42:50.880
sending over leads and closing deals. That's it.

42:50.880 --> 42:54.440
I've had them building websites, writing content, doing due diligence,

42:54.440 --> 42:59.200
setting up ads, every single thing except for doing the sales.

42:59.960 --> 43:02.120
And I would rinse and repeat until I hit 20K.

43:02.840 --> 43:05.680
OK. Now, for those of you like, oh, man,

43:05.680 --> 43:07.040
I wish I would take more notes again.

43:07.040 --> 43:10.000
Guys, if you're in 13 minutes, I'm going to be giving away.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.800
Everyone's going to get the replay of this.

43:11.800 --> 43:13.200
You guys go listen to this again.

43:13.200 --> 43:14.800
This is how I would freaking attack it.

43:14.800 --> 43:17.880
By the way, for those of you that did that just hopped on

43:18.240 --> 43:20.160
and have no idea what we're talking about,

43:21.400 --> 43:22.920
just a spoiler alert.

43:22.920 --> 43:24.200
The free group's gone.

43:24.200 --> 43:26.200
All the content's gone.

43:26.200 --> 43:29.040
Rankandretire.com. Go check it out.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.400
You can rewatch this if you want.

43:30.400 --> 43:32.480
But for those, I know we've got a bunch more people that jumped on.

43:32.680 --> 43:35.200
Rankandretire.com. It's pinned at the top.

43:35.440 --> 43:36.680
Go check it out.

43:36.680 --> 43:38.040
That is our community.

43:38.040 --> 43:40.080
That is the Rank and Rent Academy. OK.

43:41.560 --> 43:44.320
So a couple of notes real quick, notes to some giveaways.

43:45.440 --> 43:48.200
Guys, you plus one to two VA's,

43:48.720 --> 43:51.360
you can muscle your way to 20K.

43:51.360 --> 43:53.120
That's insane, right?

43:53.120 --> 43:55.400
Porter, how much you pay your VA?

43:55.400 --> 43:57.120
Well, a hundred dollars a week.

43:57.120 --> 43:58.240
So four hundred bucks a month.

43:58.240 --> 44:00.640
I think I have one VA that pay five hundred bucks a month.

44:01.040 --> 44:02.920
I think I have my guy here in Africa.

44:02.920 --> 44:04.480
It's been with me for like five years.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.760
I pay him three hundred bucks a month.

44:06.760 --> 44:09.120
I mean, imagine, right?

44:10.080 --> 44:13.720
You plus two people, that's less than a thousand dollars in payroll.

44:14.760 --> 44:16.160
You could scale to 20K a month.

44:16.160 --> 44:17.720
That's freaking insane.

44:17.720 --> 44:19.960
What other business, right?

44:19.960 --> 44:22.600
OK, when I scale, let me tell you guys this, guys,

44:22.600 --> 44:25.280
when I scaled to 100K per month, this is what my team looked like.

44:25.280 --> 44:26.480
It was me.

44:26.480 --> 44:30.120
Francesca was overseeing the sites and the clients.

44:30.720 --> 44:33.240
There was one guy helping me hook business owners.

44:33.760 --> 44:36.000
There was one guy answering and transferring leads.

44:36.720 --> 44:39.720
And then I had one and a half because one of them was part time,

44:39.720 --> 44:43.120
one and a half paid by the thousand words content writer.

44:43.600 --> 44:46.880
And I had two VA's. OK, so what is that?

44:46.880 --> 44:49.280
Like five people.

44:49.280 --> 44:52.520
One, two, three, four, five, six.

44:53.520 --> 44:58.000
Six full time, three of which were VA's or overseas.

44:58.360 --> 45:02.680
One was part time and we it was a million dollar company.

45:03.840 --> 45:06.320
That's insane. Like my payroll was nothing

45:06.840 --> 45:08.720
and it was a million dollar company.

45:08.720 --> 45:11.600
OK, seven figure agency.

45:11.600 --> 45:13.200
Now, last thing I want to cover,

45:13.200 --> 45:16.120
what what kind of time frame would I be looking at for this 20K?

45:18.040 --> 45:20.280
I if I were actually doing this for real,

45:20.720 --> 45:25.440
I would set a die goal of six months, like I'll hit six months no matter what.

45:25.680 --> 45:27.480
But I would set a stretch goal of three months.

45:27.480 --> 45:31.560
I think you could set a goal if you really, really eliminated all the

45:31.800 --> 45:34.320
distractions, you put your head down and went to work.

45:34.640 --> 45:36.480
And this is all you focused on.

45:36.480 --> 45:37.920
I think you could do it in three months.

45:37.920 --> 45:39.800
OK, I think you could.

45:39.800 --> 45:41.320
You'd really have to push.

45:41.320 --> 45:43.600
But I think if you wanted to, you could do it in three months.

45:43.600 --> 45:45.200
Now, somebody is going to quote me and say,

45:45.200 --> 45:47.400
oh, you said I could get to 20K in three months.

45:47.400 --> 45:50.360
No, I said that if you put your head down and you freaking nailed it,

45:50.360 --> 45:52.360
you could. But no, most people aren't going to do that.

45:52.440 --> 45:56.400
OK, that is, guys, the my.

45:57.560 --> 45:58.720
That's what I would do.

45:58.720 --> 45:59.840
You guys ever heard you,

45:59.840 --> 46:01.960
Porto, have you heard that show called Undercover Boss, Grant Cardone?

46:02.600 --> 46:05.480
Yeah. He got dropped in frickin what?

46:05.840 --> 46:07.840
Somewhere in Colorado. You should know.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.400
Frickin was a boulder.

46:09.400 --> 46:11.680
I think it was Boulder with like a hundred bucks.

46:11.680 --> 46:14.080
And he's supposed to create like whatever business.

46:14.800 --> 46:17.720
That would be my if you said today you got no money.

46:18.600 --> 46:20.720
You got to get a twenty thousand dollar business in three months.

46:21.960 --> 46:23.240
That's it right there.

46:23.240 --> 46:25.240
That's what I'm doing every second of every day.

46:25.240 --> 46:27.800
I'm waking up and I'm cranking it out, baby.

46:27.800 --> 46:29.880
I'm putting in my headphones, listen to a little

46:30.640 --> 46:34.040
focus music on Spotify and just, you know,

46:34.040 --> 46:36.720
maybe throwing in a couple of press ups every couple of hours.

46:37.120 --> 46:39.720
That's it, dude. Just cranking away on the computer.

46:40.560 --> 46:42.200
You can build guys.

46:42.200 --> 46:44.720
I wish I could hold up my laptop with a laptop,

46:45.240 --> 46:48.360
internet connection and some knowledge you guys can build.

46:48.360 --> 46:51.320
You guys can escape the frickin rat race. Right.

46:51.520 --> 46:54.000
Those of you that are on this call right now that had to go to work today

46:54.200 --> 46:55.360
that hated every second of it.

46:55.360 --> 46:57.440
And you're like, I can't wait for that live to see if there's a way

46:57.440 --> 47:00.520
I can do it. You can.

47:00.520 --> 47:02.520
You can. You just got to put in the work. Right.

47:02.520 --> 47:05.680
And we have literally the model and the and I just gave you guys

47:05.680 --> 47:09.240
literally a an exact game plan for how to do it.

47:09.440 --> 47:11.280
Now you just got to execute. OK.

47:11.280 --> 47:14.640
So, guys, once again, for those of you that didn't catch it,

47:14.640 --> 47:17.840
rank and retire dot com, if you guys love the free group

47:17.840 --> 47:20.640
and you want to continue it, that is what that's transition to.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.840
It is paid. It's and you know what?

47:22.840 --> 47:24.920
Again, I don't care if we go from six thousand.

47:24.960 --> 47:26.960
I don't care. By the end of the week, we go from six thousand

47:26.960 --> 47:28.520
two hundred people in the free group.

47:28.520 --> 47:32.160
And I only have fifteen people inside of that community

47:32.160 --> 47:35.240
because those fifteen people are the ones I want to work with.

47:35.240 --> 47:37.240
Those are the people I'm going to give my time to my attention to.

47:37.240 --> 47:39.080
Those are the ones that want to work because they're putting their money

47:39.080 --> 47:39.840
where their mouth is.

47:39.840 --> 47:41.920
And I promise you, they're going to consume that content

47:42.240 --> 47:45.480
way more than the people that are the lucky lose and the frickin parasites

47:45.480 --> 47:47.640
that have been, you know, infesting this group.

47:47.640 --> 47:49.800
And I'm not saying you guys, because if you're on this call,

47:49.800 --> 47:51.720
then I don't necessarily think that's you. OK.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.240
Hordy, ready to do some giveaways?

47:54.240 --> 47:55.520
I'm ready. Let's do it.

47:55.520 --> 47:58.040
Guys, who wants some free stuff?

47:58.040 --> 48:00.480
Who wants some frickin free stuff?

48:00.480 --> 48:03.400
Let's let's see.

48:03.400 --> 48:05.280
Let's go ahead. I want to ask some questions.

48:05.280 --> 48:08.000
I like to give away free stuff by asking questions.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.040
By the way, Moza, what's up?

48:09.040 --> 48:12.000
This is my buddy from South Africa.

48:12.280 --> 48:13.600
He's he's at three a.m.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.520
So he's even beat me.

48:15.520 --> 48:17.520
What's up, dude? Been a minute.

48:17.840 --> 48:21.480
OK, let's give away some stuff.

48:22.160 --> 48:24.480
Let's start off by giving.

48:27.240 --> 48:28.560
What should we give away first, Porter?

48:28.560 --> 48:29.880
I want to give away some good stuff.

48:29.880 --> 48:33.080
Let's let's start off by giving away the swag.

48:33.080 --> 48:35.760
Then we're going to give away the

48:35.760 --> 48:38.600
the two, the two, three month membership to rank in an engine.

48:38.600 --> 48:40.560
And then I'm going to tell you guys what we're going to do

48:40.560 --> 48:42.840
for the partial scholarship. How does that sound?

48:42.840 --> 48:44.920
Oh, we also got to give away the copies of the exclusive trade.

48:45.080 --> 48:46.880
OK, let me ask you this.

48:46.880 --> 48:50.480
Who wants who's interested in the

48:50.520 --> 48:54.000
I've got this 12 part exclusive training series.

48:55.040 --> 48:57.960
We covered all kinds of different topics inside.

48:57.960 --> 48:59.960
This is these are completely separate.

48:59.960 --> 49:02.200
You guys never saw these unless you were on those trainings.

49:02.200 --> 49:04.400
And I don't think anyone was on every single week.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.320
It's a 12 part series.

49:06.320 --> 49:10.480
It's about 12 hours, maybe closer to 13 hours on all kinds of different topics.

49:10.480 --> 49:11.960
I'm going to give away five copies of that.

49:11.960 --> 49:14.240
Let's get that away first.

49:14.240 --> 49:17.200
Who's if you're interested in that,

49:17.200 --> 49:19.360
drop the word training.

49:19.360 --> 49:24.400
OK, if you're interested in swag, drop the word swag.

49:24.400 --> 49:26.680
And don't you dare put swag in training.

49:26.680 --> 49:28.960
OK, training or swag?

49:28.960 --> 49:30.920
Which one? Which ones? What are you guys interested in?

49:30.920 --> 49:32.400
OK, let's see.

49:32.400 --> 49:34.720
Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see.

49:36.880 --> 49:38.720
OK.

49:42.520 --> 49:45.560
Jahill says any hoodies available, the hoodies.

49:46.160 --> 49:47.800
It's not because I don't want to give away.

49:47.800 --> 49:50.800
It's because the hoodies are for it's the 10K club.

49:51.080 --> 49:53.800
So if you see somebody rocking a hoodie, they're in the 10K.

49:53.800 --> 49:56.560
So other than that, I would have I would have said yes.

49:58.160 --> 50:01.160
OK, so let's go.

50:02.280 --> 50:05.240
Carl. So, Ashley, I need you to be taking notes here.

50:06.440 --> 50:09.520
Carl Giambri says he wants free stuff.

50:09.960 --> 50:14.080
So let's do for him, let's give him a mouse pad.

50:14.920 --> 50:17.920
OK, let's also do.

50:21.800 --> 50:24.640
Jen's Linton.

50:24.640 --> 50:27.080
Let's do a mouse pad.

50:27.560 --> 50:29.640
By the way, if you guys don't want the mouse pad, you want the coffee mug.

50:29.680 --> 50:31.040
I'm actually just going to say swag.

50:31.040 --> 50:34.320
Ashley, you can give away a mouse pad,

50:34.320 --> 50:37.080
a coffee mug, air pod case.

50:37.080 --> 50:38.480
You can let them choose.

50:38.480 --> 50:39.840
We have the stickers, whatever.

50:39.840 --> 50:42.480
So we've got Jen's.

50:42.480 --> 50:43.520
I just want you to write down the names.

50:43.520 --> 50:46.440
Swag, Jen's Linton.

50:47.640 --> 50:50.760
Carl Giambri, let me just hold my phone.

50:50.760 --> 50:53.480
I'm just making a fool of myself.

50:56.120 --> 50:58.520
Well, people, people want the training.

50:58.520 --> 51:01.280
Mr. Chris Aren't, Chris Aren't gave him the swag.

51:05.120 --> 51:07.120

51:12.840 --> 51:16.800
And who else?

51:18.320 --> 51:20.360
Carlos Braga swag.

51:23.160 --> 51:24.760
Janet Bruno wants swag.

51:24.760 --> 51:27.600
She wants the coffee mug. Give it to her.

51:27.600 --> 51:28.840
Carl, you can get the coffee mug.

51:28.840 --> 51:29.680
Just message Ashley.

51:29.680 --> 51:30.400
She's getting you.

51:30.400 --> 51:32.160
Guys, by the way, if you're a winner, reach out to Ashley.

51:32.160 --> 51:34.240
She's going to get you sorted out.

51:36.240 --> 51:39.320
OK. I don't see anyone else for swag.

51:39.320 --> 51:41.400
Let's give away some training.

51:41.440 --> 51:42.800
Porter, give me some names.

51:42.800 --> 51:45.560
We've got five copies of the training.

51:45.880 --> 51:48.840
Actually, I only gave away like five, six swag.

51:49.120 --> 51:52.280
So I'm down to give away 10 of the training.

51:52.280 --> 51:54.640
Boom, OK. So let's do it.

51:54.640 --> 51:55.720
You give me a name, I'll give a name.

51:55.720 --> 51:56.960
We'll go like that.

51:56.960 --> 51:58.920
OK, Nate, farewell.

51:58.920 --> 52:01.680
Nate, farewell for the training, Ashley.

52:01.680 --> 52:11.440
Let's go Jeff Collier with the training.

52:14.240 --> 52:16.160
Todd Johnson.

52:18.040 --> 52:20.800
OK, Todd Johnson is training.

52:20.800 --> 52:23.760
Gary Treister, I'm going to break my rules.

52:23.760 --> 52:26.960
I'm going to give Gary Treister training

52:27.720 --> 52:30.400
and I'm going to give him a coffee mug because Gary Treister, guys,

52:30.400 --> 52:33.640
is actually funny enough, was one of my first clients

52:34.000 --> 52:35.520
and he still works with me to this day.

52:35.520 --> 52:37.040
And I freaking appreciate you, brother.

52:37.040 --> 52:37.960
Good to have you on this call.

52:37.960 --> 52:39.200
So Gary, message Ashley.

52:39.200 --> 52:41.800
She's going to give you the coffee mug and the training.

52:41.960 --> 52:44.200
And yes, if you're my client on this call, you're going to get both.

52:47.440 --> 52:50.440
Let's give out who else?

52:50.440 --> 52:52.480
You say Ali Borden already?

52:52.480 --> 52:54.640
No, I didn't say that one. Ali Borden training.

52:56.920 --> 52:58.880
Nick Kudlick, you're already in digital.

52:58.920 --> 52:59.600
Just hit me up, bro.

52:59.600 --> 53:02.320
Anyone in digital landlords, by the way, you just get it.

53:03.480 --> 53:08.080
Anything we do in this stuff or the Rankin Academy, you just get already.

53:08.120 --> 53:09.160
So don't worry about that.

53:09.160 --> 53:11.320
So, Nick, I'll give you swag.

53:11.320 --> 53:15.120
Nick, Nick, message Ashley for swag.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.240
Kenneth Liu training.

53:18.240 --> 53:19.840
Who else you got for training, Porter?

53:19.840 --> 53:21.960
Let's do Kylie Sherman.

53:21.960 --> 53:24.640
OK. Kylie Sherman training.

53:25.560 --> 53:28.000
Todd Johnson says, I'll buy all your swag after training.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.240
OK, Todd, take some swag or take the training.

53:31.440 --> 53:35.280
Kevin Moss, your individual landlords, you already get the training message.

53:35.280 --> 53:37.360
Ashley, I think we've got like two more.

53:38.320 --> 53:40.360
Gina says she's working her ass off towards the hoodie.

53:40.360 --> 53:41.720
By the way, that hoodie slaps.

53:41.720 --> 53:42.760
It's not even the feel.

53:42.760 --> 53:44.360
It's just knowing you got the hoodie.

53:47.720 --> 53:49.760
Two more training Porter.

53:49.760 --> 53:53.200
Moza, Moza, my man in South Africa, I'm going to choose him.

53:53.200 --> 53:56.160
And then Porter, do one more.

53:56.440 --> 53:57.560
Let's do Edda Chapman.

53:59.560 --> 54:00.640
Is she an individual?

54:00.640 --> 54:02.200
She's an individual. She might be an individual landlord.

54:02.200 --> 54:03.440
If she is, I think she is.

54:03.440 --> 54:04.440
She's an unemployable.

54:05.360 --> 54:07.680
She's not. And OK, give her the training.

54:08.160 --> 54:09.160
OK, cool.

54:09.720 --> 54:12.680
Well, then, if I said she should be an individual, I was gosh dang it.

54:12.680 --> 54:14.440
Edda, come on. Just kidding.

54:14.640 --> 54:15.640
You should be.

54:15.840 --> 54:16.840
It should be.

54:18.600 --> 54:19.840
I think I think we did.

54:19.840 --> 54:20.840
OK.

54:20.840 --> 54:22.560
That's that. So, guys, we did that.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.520
Now, what I want to know is we're going to give away

54:26.360 --> 54:30.400
two. This is just two, three, three free months of RankinRan engine,

54:30.400 --> 54:33.600
which I referred to earlier in the call.

54:33.600 --> 54:37.120
OK, two copies or two memberships.

54:37.120 --> 54:38.760
It's three months free.

54:39.520 --> 54:41.240
And it's for two people only.

54:41.240 --> 54:44.320
I have to be really stiff on this because Ryan, the one that created

54:44.320 --> 54:47.120
the training, said it's good for just two people.

54:47.320 --> 54:48.320
So let's see.

54:48.360 --> 54:51.400
Again, guys, if you won, if I called your name, message Ashley,

54:51.400 --> 54:53.120
she'll get you taken care of. We got this.

54:53.120 --> 54:54.120
Then we're going to give away.

54:54.120 --> 54:56.160
We're going to tell you guys about the partial scholarship.

54:56.160 --> 54:58.880
We're going to wrap it up and we'll we'll go get back to work.

54:58.880 --> 55:02.680
OK, yeah, guys, don't leave it on Ashley.

55:02.680 --> 55:03.680
She's writing it down.

55:03.680 --> 55:06.680
But if you want something, you got a message, Ashley, please.

55:06.680 --> 55:09.480
So that she can get it to you guys and she's going to have a bunch of work.

55:09.480 --> 55:11.560
So be patient with her. I'm giving her a ton of work.

55:11.560 --> 55:12.560
Thanks, Ashley.

55:12.560 --> 55:13.560
I'm going to leave it on Ashley.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.560
She's writing it down.

55:14.560 --> 55:17.080
But if you want something, you got a message, Ashley, please.

55:17.120 --> 55:18.120
Thanks, Ashley.

55:20.040 --> 55:22.320
Kevin Mead just says he never got his last swag.

55:22.600 --> 55:26.240
That should be a confusion because that's that's that's

55:26.360 --> 55:28.720
that's literally a drop shit like he just goes to you.

55:28.720 --> 55:30.640
So just message Ashley, bro.

55:30.640 --> 55:34.760
No worries. And we can tell, by the way, Kevin Mead, if you did get it before.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.800
So we know if you're lying, bro.

55:36.800 --> 55:40.320
And I will I will know we can, though, for real. OK.

55:40.320 --> 55:46.320
OK. Let's see.

55:49.040 --> 55:51.280
Let's see. Whoa, lots of comments.

55:55.840 --> 55:57.840
Let's do.

55:59.040 --> 56:01.680
Shane Noble, I think, is one of the

56:02.520 --> 56:06.560
as a rank and rent engine, three month, three month free.

56:10.480 --> 56:12.000
Moza said training one more time.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.120
Moza, you already won the training.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.360
Just message Ashley. I got it for you, bro.

56:18.960 --> 56:20.720
Yeah, message Ashley just on Facebook.

56:28.040 --> 56:32.080
And. Let's also do.

56:32.560 --> 56:33.560
Who's this?

56:35.440 --> 56:38.960
Christian Story, second winner on rank and rent engine.

56:42.720 --> 56:44.120
You still with me, Porter?

56:44.120 --> 56:47.440
Yeah. Crazy, it's two a.m., dude, and we're freaking cooking.

56:47.440 --> 56:49.040
There's no way I'm going to be able to sleep tonight.

56:49.040 --> 56:50.040
I love it.

56:50.040 --> 56:52.920
Yeah, dude, you boy got dressed up today.

56:52.920 --> 56:55.120
All right, guys, let's talk about the partial scholarship.

56:55.720 --> 56:56.720
Just real quick.

56:56.720 --> 56:58.640
We're going to talk about the partial scholarship.

56:58.640 --> 57:00.680
All right, guys, let's talk about the partial scholarship

57:01.560 --> 57:04.720
just real quick, just so that when the winner is chosen,

57:04.720 --> 57:08.200
no one's like, oh, it's not this isn't an entire scholarship.

57:08.200 --> 57:09.200
It's a partial scholarship.

57:09.200 --> 57:12.160
So you are going to get a partial scholarship.

57:12.160 --> 57:14.520
That's what it means. OK, here's what we're going to do,

57:14.520 --> 57:17.880
because we don't know necessarily who's applied in the past, whatever.

57:17.880 --> 57:20.320
So this is what we found to be the easiest thing as we discussed it.

57:22.160 --> 57:24.080
If you are interested in the partial scholarship,

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
need you to do two things. OK,

57:27.280 --> 57:30.440
I need you to send the following to Francesca on a message.

57:30.440 --> 57:32.560
If you send it to me, we're not going to see it.

57:32.560 --> 57:37.480
Send it to Francesca Ravinelli, our Italian stallion from Frickin.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.960
I think she's from Trento, Italy.

57:39.960 --> 57:42.760
She is amazing. She does all of the stuff for my agency.

57:42.760 --> 57:45.840
She's responsible for a lot of our success, if not all of it.

57:46.360 --> 57:49.160
I need you to message her if you are interested in the partial scholarship.

57:49.160 --> 57:50.440
And I need you to say two things.

57:50.440 --> 57:52.680
Number one is what you do for work right now.

57:52.680 --> 57:55.720
It's a business. If it's a job, what the job is, whatever.

57:55.760 --> 57:57.040
Just tell her what you do for work.

57:57.040 --> 57:59.840
And number two, why you think you deserve the partial scholarship.

58:00.760 --> 58:01.840
OK, that's it.

58:01.840 --> 58:05.960
And I will tell you that I will let her decide.

58:06.280 --> 58:08.280
I'm going to let her read all of them.

58:08.280 --> 58:09.480
She's going to be able to.

58:09.480 --> 58:13.440
I'm going to give her the the complete autonomy to decide based on the answers.

58:14.120 --> 58:15.760
Who is the winner of the partial scholarship?

58:15.760 --> 58:18.120
She will reach out to you. We'll announce it to just so everyone knows

58:18.120 --> 58:19.640
that we actually did choose a winner.

58:19.640 --> 58:22.040
She'll reach out to you, let you know you on the partial scholarship.

58:22.720 --> 58:24.440
For me, just to choose someone randomly.

58:24.440 --> 58:27.720
And then if, you know, they've already applied or whatever,

58:27.720 --> 58:29.840
it just didn't make sense. It's kind of a waste of time.

58:29.840 --> 58:32.040
So if you guys are interested in the partial scholarship,

58:32.040 --> 58:36.040
digital landlords, partial scholarship and go message Francesca

58:37.240 --> 58:41.920
and tell her what you do for work and why you think you're deserving of it. OK.

58:42.760 --> 58:46.440
So, guys, with that said one more time, for those of you that are new,

58:46.600 --> 58:48.440
just getting on the call, let me get some water here.

58:51.040 --> 58:53.960
The free group, the art of pre-selling,

58:53.960 --> 58:57.760
as it was formerly known right now, called the Art of Digital Real Estate

58:58.680 --> 59:02.520
is no more. All of the training, all of me going live

59:02.520 --> 59:05.680
150 plus times are done. They're gone.

59:05.680 --> 59:08.280
It's done. It's over. It was fun.

59:08.280 --> 59:09.800
We had a great ride.

59:09.800 --> 59:11.920
No one appreciates what they don't pay for.

59:11.920 --> 59:14.840
If you are interested in still being part of the community

59:15.160 --> 59:19.360
and what it has evolved to in version 2.0, if you are not in digital lands,

59:19.360 --> 59:21.200
if you're in digital landlords, you're not going to pay for it.

59:21.200 --> 59:23.200
We're going to try to sort out how we get you guys all in there.

59:23.200 --> 59:25.640
So don't worry. You're going to have access to everything.

59:25.640 --> 59:30.480
If you're not in digital landlords, go to rankandretire.com.

59:31.480 --> 59:36.600
You can also go to school.com SKOL and search for Rank and Rent Academy.

59:36.600 --> 59:38.520
Either way, go check it out.

59:38.520 --> 59:41.280
I've got a about little blurb on about.

59:41.280 --> 59:45.400
There's a video, a nine minute video that explains a little bit more into.

59:47.640 --> 59:50.920
Excuse me, bud, a little more into what we cover in there.

59:51.240 --> 59:55.320
But guys, people that pay for stuff, they value it more.

59:55.320 --> 59:57.840
And I'm telling you right now, I do not care about the numbers.

59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.600
I don't care if there's three, two, one person, ten people, fifteen.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.360
I don't care if we go from six thousand two hundred down to ten.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.920
Does not matter because I know those ten people. I'm stoked.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.920
I'm going to mess it.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.320
We're going to you're going to get a very personal feel for me.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.840
And for those of you that are wondering,

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.040
what's the difference between digital landlords and

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.760
Rank and Rent Academy, the new community, everything.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.280
OK, just like the free group and the digital landlords, everything.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:27.040
However, I will tell you, there's all new training inside of the Rank and Rent Academy.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.360
We've got a bunch of stuff that we didn't have before.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.840
And we are going to be loading every single live that I ever did.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.560
Ever in the free group, 150 plus lives,

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.640
150 plus hours, way more than that, actually,

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.920
into the vault and also into the the interview series.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.240
OK, community world map, all that good stuff.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.640
I'm going to be going live once a week, which we used to do.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.880
Now I feel excited to go live because if you're paying to be there,

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.800
you better be on the freaking live.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.480
So, guys, go hop in there.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:02.560
Rank and Rent Academy, Rank and Retire dot com.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.760
Check it out. Now, what I want to do, Porter, you got ten minutes.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.000
Yeah, we're good. Since this is our last call,

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.960
I want to just I want to see if anyone has any final questions.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.160
Ten minutes. I'm going to give ten minutes any questions.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.640
Maybe we'll give away a little more swag.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.640
I don't know. But if anybody has questions, I want to just answer them.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.240
I really, really, really.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:26.560
I hope you guys know I really poured my heart and soul into this community.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:32.480
I have spent so many freaking hours just just commenting,

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.160
just answering questions, just reading posts.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.280
I don't know if you guys know of any other free communities out there

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.520
that had paid admins.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.080
OK, fix it.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.320
Felix was not a free, but it was somebody I paid somebody

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.640
on my personal team that I paid every week to go and service the free group.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.640
We put a lot in that, man.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:59.080
I put so many hours in that and it was a back and forth, back and forth.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.680
Should we get rid of it? Should we not?

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.640
Guys, I wish we didn't have to get rid of it.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.920
It was it was amazing.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:06.840
It was such a good thing.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.680
But all good things come to an end, just like when you give a business

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.400
owner free leads and they stop.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.240
They think they can do it on their own or they stop appreciating it.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.560
It kind of loses its sizzle.

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.280
It lost its sizzle, man.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.680
It was it was a great run.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.040
But let's go build an amazing community.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.960
Let's go build the rank and run academy.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.280
For those of you that are actually serious about learning this model

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:28.440
that want to go to the next level, I'll see you in there.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.800
OK, let's see if there's any questions really quick.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.000
Eight minutes. We're done. OK.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.400
All right.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.840
Pat says, if you're sending ads.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.600
To a B.O.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.720
And you fail to land the deal, what do you do with the ad campaign?

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.960
What do you do, Porter?

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.560
If I failed, read it one more time.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.720
You're running you're sending ads to a B.O.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.880
And you failed to land the deal.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.840
What do you do with the ad campaign?

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.200
I find I find another business owner from getting leads

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.800
and I didn't sell the first business owner.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.840
I'll go and try to find another business owner.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.680
And most likely, it was something that I did.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.720
It's not the area.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.400
So don't give up on the area.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.320
If you're getting leads, keep trying.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.760
There's always an option to find a business owner.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.880
Yep. Same same exact answer.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.440
I knew I figured you'd answer like that.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:21.680
So I said that, by the way, Chandler Christensen, how do we get the replay?

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.800
I would love to just post a link right now because

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.880
it would be the easiest thing, but we're still recording the replay, unfortunately.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:35.040
So what you're going to have to do is anybody that wants it.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.160
You're going to message Ashley.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.440
Actually, I am so sorry.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.840
She's going to get a million messages.

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.240
She's going to kill me.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:45.400
Message Ashley as soon as this calls over and ask for the replay.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.560
Give her a little bit of time.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.400
Just say the word replay for the love.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.080
Just say the word replay so she can just send you the link and move on to the next one.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.600
But you can get it there if you're on this call right now. OK.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.720
Carl says you talked about running ads and then building out a site.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:04.920
We're starting with a small site, then transitioning to move to a permanent site after you.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:10.080
Yeah. So that's what you do is you start out with a you start out with a landing page.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.640
You run the ads through landing page, you get the deal, then you build up the site.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:17.240
What I was telling you, if I was going to go to 20K, I would that would be my primary focus.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:23.000
But I'd also try to go for my my most low hanging fruit project or due diligence.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.280
And I would build that one out so I can get I could have one project

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.440
ranking while I'm running ads and landing deals.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.200
OK, because I want to have both.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.440
Right. I've started to realize, like, as an agency, you want to have all kinds of different stuff moving.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:42.960
OK. Matthew says, no questions, been binging your podcast and learned a ton,

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.080
thinking about applying, but not sure on cost.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.200
We'll think it over. No problem.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.000
Matthew, send me a message.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.840
Actually, you know what, Matthew, by the way, anybody on this call,

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:58.640
that is has a question or that needs any further help.

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.600
Porter, are you down to do a couple of calls?

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:05.120
Yeah, I'm going to drop my phone number in the chat.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.720
Drop. Porter's going to drop his phone number.

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:14.160
Matthew, you specifically message Porter, jump on a call with him and ask any questions

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:18.520
that you have and he'll answer for you. OK, so don't just do that.

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.320
And that's actually Porter's cell phone.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:24.280
So if you guys want to go drop it in, like, you know, those things in the mall, like you

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:28.320
you win a free motorcycle, go drop his number in those and then he'll get spammed for life.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.600
So, yeah, Matthew, do that.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.160
Edgar says you've done a great job with all the teaching.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.520
Bless you, Edgar. Bless you.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.000
Stephanie says, I just joined the free community.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.080
Am I the reason it's ending?

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:45.240
L.O.L. Stephanie, no, please don't feel like that.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.440
It's literally just a timing thing.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:53.320
But I promise you that you will get way more out of this, even if it's 50 bucks,

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.640
because you're spending it, you are going to get more out of it.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:00.320
I know it sounds like, oh, Nick's just making an excuse to make more money.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:09.320
Guys, I've had people come to me that want to, you know, these are people that are really close to me.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.520
Let's say family, friends, friends that are really close to me.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.400
Want to, you know, these are people that are really close to me.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.760
Let's say family, friends.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:23.080
And I promise you and they're like, hey, I want to learn this business model, right?

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.320
I want to get into this.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.400
I want to learn. I want to do what you do.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.720
And I promise you on my kid's life, it's not about the money.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:35.440
And every part of me wants to just be like, you know, just here's the password, homey hook up.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.800
Like that whole thing.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:43.840
But I'm telling you right now that it doesn't work because they never open it.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.400
They never, they never, ever open it.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.520
They never take it.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.200
But when you have skin in the game, even if it's a little bit of skin, you're like,

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.440
I'm going to get into this community.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.280
I'm going to go freaking do the like you're going to go through the modules.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.960
By the way, in the first mini course, it has some homework.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.160
Do all the freaking homework.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.960
Has you go drop while you're in the group, blah, blah, blah.

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.080
Go do all that.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.880
But you're going to go watch all the mini courses.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:08.600
You're going to go do all that stuff because you've you've paid to be there.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:12.960
Right. Even if it's a little over a dollar a day, you're going to go freaking squeeze

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.560
that thing for what it's worth because you spent money on it.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.960
OK. So, yeah, it's not because of you, Stephanie.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.600
Jahill says you should call this live, the giant pullback.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:30.160
That's a cool name, but it's not a pullback because we're actually ending the group.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.840
No question. Just thank you, Ali.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.000
Thank you for that comment.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.360
Let's see.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.280
OK, Kenneth says, thanks so much, Nick and team question.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:50.800
How would you respond to a business owner saying, why don't you do ads

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.560
slash SEO on my website instead of building your own separate site that I don't own?

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.960
How would you convince them about the business model?

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.240
Kenneth, what I would say is I can.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.000
I can do I do both.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:05.640
But the reason I'm doing this is because it's going to be a lot more

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.920
affordable for you.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:10.640
And the only reason you want me to do any work on your website

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.920
is because you want leads.

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.280
So if you want, I can go and do a bunch of stuff and send you a report,

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.160
whatever on your website is going to cost you a lot more.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.040
And it's going to be a 12 month contract.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:23.280
Or I can build my own website, get you what comes from the website,

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.640
which is leads, and you pay a lot less.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.440
You're renting it for me.

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.800
So but yeah, and if you want to, I'll give you a price on it.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.280
And I'll quote them super high.

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.880
And if they say yes to that, I'll just do that.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.440
And then I'll still sell them a lead gen it later.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.840
Never say no, there's always an option.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.120
100 percent.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:45.280
Porter's number four, three, five, three, nine, three, five, six, nine, four.

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.440
Everyone drop it into a spam filter, please.

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.600
Just not the insurance one to the marketplace.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.960
We can smoke you.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.880
Steve Wall, have you been seeing exact match domains

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.400
getting smacked this most recent Google update now?

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:02.080
Not really, but I'm not super spammy like that.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:07.480
And I'm not saying that spammy, but if I did get an exact match domain,

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.040
I didn't do anything else that was spammy.

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:15.560
Kevin says, if we're in DLL course, Kevin, what it means is you're going to have access.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.240
But listen, if you're in DLL, that's the advanced stuff.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.840
That's where you want to be anyway.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:25.040
So you think you're going to have access to this, but it's not.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.440
It's not it.

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:30.200
You're going to want to stay in digital landlords where the values are.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:33.960
So you're not you're going to again, free access for life.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:36.160
You get all the value if you want to go check it out.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:40.760
But yeah, you're not you're not going to probably even spend that much time.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.960
You can. OK, so you get it for free. Don't worry.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.720
Brandon says he also just joined yesterday.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.680
Awful timing.

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.560
And Annie says, I've loved your podcast, said I don't have them anymore.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.640
Oh, they're coming.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.800
By the way, I recorded one on Saturday night here in Africa.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:04.000
It was a 22 minute podcast and 18 minutes in the power went out, lost it.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.240
OK, unfortunately, I haven't had a time this week at all

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.920
as I've been preparing for this live to record it.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.080
But you're going to see them again.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.280
So keep an eye on it. And he appreciate that.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.000
Steve says he appreciates all the freebies.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.240
Yeah, Isaac did say Isaac says Nick's been doing a pullback

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.280
warning about this for a year. Finally, I'm doing it.

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.600
Everyone thought I was lying.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:25.480
Guys, I appreciate you being on.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.880
Ma says bike away.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:31.320
You're welcome, brother.

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.960
Steve says, so we wouldn't be buying a bike.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.520
We wouldn't be buying a bike.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.080
We wouldn't be buying a bike. We wouldn't be buying a bike.

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.560
We wouldn't be buying a bike. We wouldn't be buying a bike.

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.560
He says, so we wouldn't be buying both digital

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.720
landlords and the school group, or do you recommend them both?

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.440
Well, I know that question, guys.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:57.720
This school is just the community is just like the free group, right?

01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:00.800
It's not going to have every single thing that digital landowners are going to have.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.360
It's not going to cover in depth.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.440
It's a introduction to rank and rent.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.280
It's a community. It's me going live.

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.280
It's it's it's got many courses.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.400
It's got a vault with all the old stuff.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.800
It is for all intents and purposes, the Facebook group

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.400
converted into a community.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:22.440
But now, because I'm working with committed people,

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:25.360
I'm I'm ready to go at it again. I'm ready to come go live.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.160
I'm ready to to give a ton of time, effort, energy,

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.640
throw a bunch of resources at it.

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:35.880
OK, digital landlords is like that's where you're going to end up.

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.360
When you're ready from school, you'll end up in digital landlords.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.480
So if you're thinking about what should I do?

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.640
You definitely are going to want to do digital landlords.

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.920
The reason why we did school is because if you're brand new

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.800
and you want to check it out, you want to build the community, blah, blah, blah.

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.000
That's where that's at. OK.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.080
But again, for those of you that didn't catch this,

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.840
if you're in rank and rent academy,

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.800
let's say for six months, 20 percent of the money that you spend

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.960
when you decide to join digital landlords is going to be credited

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.400
towards your membership

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.360
and you're going to get that discount off of digital landlords. OK.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.920
Order anything else?

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.400
No, I would say, guys, if you join school,

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.720
you're going to get a message from me.

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.000
Reply back if you guys need help.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:18.920
Feel free to message me.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.760
I'd love to get on one on one calls with you.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.840
And don't be thinking this is a sales call.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.920
It's strictly to help you.

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:26.400
I already know eventually you're going to join digital landlords anyway.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.360
So I'm not going to try to push that on you.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.480
But I will give you the information that you need.

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.080
But again, reply back.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.000
We're just trying to help you guys.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
So yeah, orders in there. Jason's in there.

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.040
Guys, you have these people that are doing 10K a month.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.640
They'll jump. They're giving you their cell phone number.

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.240
Hop on a call.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.760
And this is going to be in the school community exclusively.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.960
Hop on a call and ask them questions.

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:51.080
If you have a niche idea, if you have, you know,

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:54.280
I know Matthew had some questions about joining digital landlords,

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:57.560
stuff like that, any of that kind of stuff, jump on, ask them, feel free.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:58.640
They're getting paid to do it.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.640
And they're happy to do it, adding value.

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.800
So, guys, it's been freaking fun.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.480
It's two seventeen in the morning in West Africa.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.080
It's been a long week. I'm stoked.

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.880
I'm going to wake up tomorrow and crank out these last two days.

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:12.000
Twenty twenty five is the year, guys.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.200
Finally time to to sally up and hit those goals.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.600
So, guys, appreciate you.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.600
And we'll see you inside of the Rankin Red Academy. I'm out.
