1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
What are the expectations that we're setting?

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,160
There's two different types of expectations, right?

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,440
There's expectations in terms of like actual results,

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,200
how many leads, how many phone calls,

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,320
and then there's expectations in terms of like

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,200
when the website's gonna get set up,

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,720
when we're gonna be doing this,

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,560
we're gonna be doing that,

9
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,160
when things are gonna be live.

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,440
What are the expectations

11
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,000
that you are setting with the client?

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,320
In terms of like timelines and stuff like that,

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,120
I never, and I hate to say this, but I don't promise.

14
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,880
I never say, oh, it's gonna be done

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,760
in 72 hours or three days.

16
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,000
I never give them precise answers.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,320
And it's not because I'm trying to be sketchy.

18
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,760
It's because I know from the past that things can happen.

19
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,080
And if I'm 12 hours late or a day late,

20
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,160
I don't want them to think that I'm not reliable.

21
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,680
So I tell them, hey, it's roughly a week,

22
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,840
and then I would rather get it done sooner,

23
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,480
which kind of goes back to how you do sales.

24
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,000
Like you always wanna undersell it.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,880
So that's what I always do.

26
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,800
I don't promise.

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,720
If somebody asks like,

28
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,640
how many leads am I supposed to receive?

29
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,560
I never, ever, ever, ever say, oh, a minimum of 10.

30
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,760
Never, because you can't predict that,

31
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,760
and you would be lying if you were telling them,

32
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,840
oh, at least 10, because how do you know

33
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,480
how many people are going to the call?

34
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,680
No matter if you're ranking or not, so.

35
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,560
100%.

36
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,440
And at the end of the day also, it doesn't,

37
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,320
I mean, it does matter how many leads you get them,

38
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,560
but what I always try to,

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,360
I always try when I get questions like that,

40
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,960
I try to let them know,

41
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,440
hey, this isn't about how many leads I get you.

42
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,440
This is about how much money you make, right?

43
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,160
Because if I only sent you three leads a month,

44
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,960
but you knew you were gonna close all three of those deals

45
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,680
and you were gonna make X amount of money,

46
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,960
you know, that was gonna be a three X

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,800
on the money you're spending with me,

48
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,440
you wouldn't care how many leads.

49
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,960
So at the end of the day, I always like to let them know

50
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,640
and like try to frame it as like,

51
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,160
I care more about how much money they make

52
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,160
than I do about how many leads I'm getting them,

53
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,960
because I know I could get them 100 leads a month,

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,400
but if they're not making money,

55
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,000
whether it's my fault or not,

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,480
they're going to eventually cancel.

57
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,320
So that's number one.

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,360
The other thing you have to just set expectations

59
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,560
that I would just add,

60
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,640
and I think that we do this more during the actual sale

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,480
when you're closing the deal,

62
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,640
is I like to let them know,

63
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,440
the reason that we do a six month contract

64
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,800
is because we're gonna take the average of the six months.

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,920
Okay, we're gonna take the average

66
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,440
of how many leads came in,

67
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,760
how many deals were closed,

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,800
how much money was made,

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,040
how much money was put in their pocket

70
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,480
over a six month period.

71
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,160
Because if we look at one month,

72
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,320
let's say we do a deal,

73
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,640
and I always explain this to the business owner,

74
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,960
I say, hey, Mr. Business Owner, it's spring,

75
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,480
we just got tax returns back,

76
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,080
everyone's spending money on cleaning up the yard.

77
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,120
If we do a one month deal in April,

78
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,440
because it's tax season,

79
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,120
and we get you X amount of leads,

80
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,760
is it safe to assume that we're gonna get you

81
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,600
that many leads every single month?

82
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,120
And of course the answer is no,

83
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,320
because that's gonna be a really good month, right?

84
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,200
And likewise, if it's December,

85
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,520
and I only get you one lead,

86
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,480
because it's Christmas and no one wants to spend,

87
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,000
is it safe to assume that every month

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,040
is gonna be like that?

89
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,400
Well, no, of course not.

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,080
So, okay, Mr. Business Owner, just so you know,

91
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,800
the reason we're doing this for six months

92
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,160
is I need you to be patient with me.

93
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,440
We're gonna have some months that are gonna be great,

94
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,280
we're gonna have some months

95
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
that are not gonna be great,

96
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,280
we're gonna have some days

97
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,600
you're gonna get multiple leads,

98
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,240
we're gonna have some weeks that you get no leads.

99
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,360
But the thing that we're looking at

100
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,800
is the average of the six months.

101
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,080
And so that's why I need you to give me

102
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,400
this six month period.

103
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,040
At the end of the six months,

104
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,840
if you've done your job and I've done my job

105
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,200
and it's just not working,

106
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,200
then trust me, I'll be the first one to cut this thing off.

107
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,400
That's it.

108
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,120
It's the pullback, but it's also just being real.

109
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Like, it's so, sometimes it's so hard to like,

110
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,400
you know, we were getting the deal and we're excited,

111
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,680
and we want every,

112
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,400
we wanna give everyone the best answer, right?

113
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,680
So, you know, people are like,

114
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,120
hey, so, you know, how quickly will you have this done?

115
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,800
And sometimes we're like, we wanna be like,

116
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,880
yeah, it'll be done in two days

117
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,680
because it's been that way before,

118
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,080
but we don't know for sure.

119
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,480
And we somehow wanna impress this client

120
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,480
and we say stupid stuff that keeps like, ties us in.

121
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,200
It's so much better to just pause and go,

122
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,440
you know what, we've done it in as little as a few days,

123
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,040
but just to be realistic with you,

124
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,200
I would plan on like giving us at minimum,

125
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,360
you know, seven to 10 days,

126
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,800
just in case something happens.

127
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,960
I'd rather just, you know, plan on that

128
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,000
and then surprise you.

129
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,480
You have no idea.

130
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,320
Do you know what?

131
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,360
Every single time you do something like that,

132
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,520
it builds trust.

133
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,680
Every time you do that,

134
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,560
you're different than the last person.

135
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,880
You're different than the last person that told you,

136
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,520
hey, we're gonna get X amount of leads

137
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,000
and we're gonna blow it up and blah, blah, blah,

138
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,480
and then nothing ever happened, right?

139
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,520
So, I love what Matthew said

140
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,600
and it's, I would kind of call that a pullback,

141
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,800
but the deal's already done,

142
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,440
but I would just say just being real

143
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,680
and just being like transparent

144
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,800
and giving an honest answer,

145
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
instead of like giving the best case,

146
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,720
give the worst case, okay?

147
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,360
And when you do that,

148
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,920
what we think sometimes it's gonna lose us the deal,

149
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,040
it's gonna make it so we're not gonna get the deal.

150
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,520
Actually, it's gonna solidify the deal.

151
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,320
Actually, it's going to make it seem

152
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,800
like we're actually legitimate and we're real

153
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,400
and we're gonna take care of them.
