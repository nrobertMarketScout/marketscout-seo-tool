00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
For those of you that are like,

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,640
hey, the leads are a little bit slow,

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,320
whatever, whatever, whatever,

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,680
here's my go-to, this is what I like to do is,

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,280
during the first contract,

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,320
and I think I covered this last week,

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,280
if there's six-month contract,

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,760
I am doing a touch, a check-in with them

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,360
every single week during the first contract.

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,080
If it's six-month contract,

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,200
I am touching base with them 24 times, okay?

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,240
And of those 24 times, at least once a month,

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,680
I'm doing a Zoom call,

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,560
and we are going over the leads, okay?

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,400
We're gonna send them the leads,

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,040
I'm gonna say, hey, let's jump on a Zoom,

17
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,720
I'm gonna say, which one of these leads did you talk to?

18
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,200
Have you talked to Jack, did you talk to Mark,

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,840
did you talk to Zane?

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,240
Cool, did you schedule them for an estimate?

21
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,640
Awesome, did you give them a quote?

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,800
Great, did you follow up with the quote?

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,280
Beautiful, okay?

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,480
Okay, I sent you 20 leads and you gotta hold the two?

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,560
Well, Jack, how the fuck are you gonna make money?

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,720
How are you gonna make money

27
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,680
by talking to two people I'm sending you 20, okay?

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,600
So you have to do these soft touches.

29
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,400
So that's my advice, if things are a little bit slow,

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,680
things have been a little bit weird with the deal,

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,280
you're gonna have to be over,

32
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,520
you're gonna have to over-communicate.

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,560
I would recommend a touch every single week,

34
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,600
and then once a month,

35
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,440
I would be jumping on a Zoom call reviewing the leads.

36
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,120
But at the end of the day, even that,

37
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,200
that's just gonna buy you a little bit of time.

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,400
The short answer, the right answer,

39
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,800
if they don't make money, they will cancel,

40
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,680
and it might be tomorrow, it might be next month,

41
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,360
it might be next week, it might be in six months,

42
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,520
it might be in two years,

43
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,960
because they just don't keep track of their budget.

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
If the customer does not make money,

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,080
even if it's not your fault, they will cancel.
