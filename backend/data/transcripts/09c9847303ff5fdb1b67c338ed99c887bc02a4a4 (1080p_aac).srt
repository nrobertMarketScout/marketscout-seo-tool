00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Gabe says, when leads start coming in on a new ad,

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,080
do you get multiple business owners on the hook

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,320
from the get or focus on the first?

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,000
We've had different people do different things in here.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,840
Let me pour a little bit more mojito.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,800
Oh man, oh man.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,800
If only you guys knew what that tasted like.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,280
Oh man.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,240
Good thing that's not spiked.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,080
So the answer is it's up to you.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,960
I personally, I like to just do one.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,760
I personally do one.

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,400
However, we've tried both.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,960
I know there's people in here.

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,400
I think Devin Hutcherson, he does multiple people

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,800
just to kind of have those backups.

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,480
I typically do one and I'll send them like one or two

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,520
or three and then I go from the time I talk to a business

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,280
owner to the time I close, it's not long.

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,920
And I'm always thinking, how can I do this quicker?

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,760
So if they're like, hey, let's talk on Monday.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,560
I'm like, how do we talk on Friday?

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,880
If they're like, hey, let's talk next Tuesday.

24
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,680
I'm like, how do we talk on Saturday?

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,360
I like to shorten my period up and I like to see,

26
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,840
hey, can I close this guy in 24 hours?

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,640
So I like to focus on one person and just really,

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
really like just move fast and go,

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,480
but I know other people have had success too.

30
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,120
So it's really up to you, man.
