1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
All right, guys.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I think we are hopefully live.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let me know if you guys can hear me.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm going to do the everyone tag.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Boom.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There's that.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
All right.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let me bring.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
All right.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hey, guys.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
All right.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Awesome.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let me know if you guys can hear me.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Um,

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There we go.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There it is.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
All right.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Waiting for, um,

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Give me a few seconds here.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I want to get you guys set up.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Um,

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is going to be our new search.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Um, campaign.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That we've been talking about doing.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is going to be a website traffic one.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Not a call one.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Um,

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
There's Francesca.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hey, Francesca.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Are you coming on?

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let me know if you can hear me.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hello.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hello.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I know.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Aren't they all.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Um,

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
All right.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I think I got us on here.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let me check.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Um,

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The group, make sure there's nobody with any questions.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Um,

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Josh is asking and can't tune in for this stream. Yes.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is going to be penned hopefully to the top or one of the other

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
websites.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Um,

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And then, um,

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We'll be building on this again.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I kept told everybody.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We're going to be, uh, making.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Uh, like better, more polished versions for this,

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that we can dive deeper into things on.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That'll eventually get added to the backside of the website.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But for right now, we're just putting this up here so you guys can get

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
going.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And you don't have to wait on us and things getting edited and

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Um,

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I think that's kind of where we're at.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Um,

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Just give me one quick second here.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I find that the, um,

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, I think the last time I told you,

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
it's like super delayed between Facebook and us.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's weird.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So questions come in later.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So I, I'm going to pull this up on my phone.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And this silence it, but it's just, uh,

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's weird.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Right.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That was like 10 seconds ago.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I know it's weird.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's super weird.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm just going to leave this off to the side.

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So if I see.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Uh, chats come in, they can pick them up.

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
All right.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Um, okay. So today we're going to set up.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Uh, another search campaign.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Uh, earlier today I went on and I made the changes to the call

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
only ad that we did for the new Orleans duck work.

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Um, so I set those up.

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And we're going to be, um,

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Doing the same thing to this one in like a week or two, right?

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Cause those are, as you know, with your experience,

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
like that's just a common thing.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And it's one of the negative drawbacks of the search campaigns for

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
sure.

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Um, okay. So with that, we're going to do.

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Screen share.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm so slow at this stuff today. All right.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I feel like I've been like on the phone or zooms all day today.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And I feel like I've done nothing.

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So, um,

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sure you've done a lot.

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
My checking account does not agree.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Um,

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Anyways, it's been maintenance day.

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I feel like today's been maintenance day, but that's, that's just happens.

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All right. Um,

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay. So before we dive into this one,

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's see, Jason has a question and I have a new question.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I just joined the group about two weeks ago for unpaid balance.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The appeal date times.

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You know,

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah, Jason, that's totally normal. Oh no. Unpaid balance. Oh,

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Uh,

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
My experience with the unpaid balance thing is, um,

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If you search the group,

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
you'll see a bunch of chats about it like from like a year or two ago.

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But typically what's like,

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
there's something that's tied to your Gmail or a credit card or something

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
like deep inside the world that Google could be store music,

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
YouTube or something.

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So if you, if you're looking for unpaid balance,

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
like you're looking for something that's like,

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm looking for something, um,

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
getting you a gift card,

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
something that's like got a weird balance on it.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And that's what's holding you up.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So just check that go back through your history.

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And, um, eventually you'll be able to find it. Okay.

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Hopefully that helps, but.

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It does happen. You just gotta go find it.

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I've had stuff for like 72 cents.

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But I don't know.

141
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So.

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
All right.

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,040
So we'll, we'll hop in. If you have anything, you know, the rules, just yell, scream, stop me.

144
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,680
If I start getting too nerdy or not into something like make sure we,

145
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,880
we bring it back around. So, all right. Okay. Let's get started. Okay, guys. So we're going

146
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,640
to set up a, it's a different type of search campaign. The first one that we set up is a call

147
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,440
only ad. So today we're going to set up one. That's going to be a website traffic ad, but it's

148
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,600
good. It still has the options to get calls. It's just, it's just displayed a little differently.

149
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,000
They're both valuable in a perfect world. I would set up call only and the website traffic, but

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,040
sometimes when you do that, you like double your ad spend. So for today, today we're going to do,

151
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,160
we're going to set up a one for an Atlanta towing site. This is a one pager,

152
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,960
right? Super simple. We only one pager for towing. Obviously like call only would be better

153
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,160
for towing, but we're going to set this up with website traffic. And then I can always change

154
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,480
this later on the other end of it, but for display purposes, we're going to do this. So

155
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,640
we've created the campaign, right? We do that just like in the, in the original training,

156
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,240
you go to your MCC, you set up your sub account, and then you go from there.

157
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,280
Okay. So we're going to set up new campaign. Okay. We're going to come to here. It's going

158
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,160
to ask us like what our guidance is, right? So we're going to select website traffic.

159
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,000
And then it's going to ask us what platform we want to be on. And we're going to say search.

160
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,280
Okay. Now it's going to ask our website. We're going to go here.

161
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,280
We're going to copy that. We're going to paste that in. We're going to say, yeah, man,

162
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,560
page view for sure. Then we're going to put here.

163
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,000
This stuff right here, like I'm not a huge fan of giving Google all my data

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,320
because we're doing Legion, but you do you.

165
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:36,160
Okay. Bidding. You could do conversions or clicks. I prefer to do max clicks, especially

166
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,920
at the beginning as I'm getting data. I'm then a fan at like month three or four moving into

167
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,120
conversions, because there's going to be all of this data that Google's compiled. And then it's

168
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,720
going to help me do better conversion rates. If my experience, my opinion is if you set

169
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:03,040
conversions up in the beginning, Google's going to waste more of your money. So I'm not a fan.

170
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:11,440
So I go here. I go to clicks. Okay. Now what I want to do is I want to set a maximum cost per

171
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,920
click because Google is going to always want to spend my money. It'll give me $30 clicks,

172
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:28,320
$40 clicks or whatever. So in this campaign, I have several keywords that Francesca provided me.

173
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:35,200
I just did Mangles. I set it up over Atlanta. You can use SEMrush. I just prefer Mangles for local

174
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,400
because I use Ahrefs for like other stuff. So the one I put in was towing. That's right here.

175
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,200
You can see the CPC, the search volume, and then these are some of my other keywords that we're

176
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,240
going to use. And you can see search volume and CPC. Now this is what Mangles says. This has been

177
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,360
a question I've seen a couple of times. SEMrush says this. Mangles says that. But then it's actually

178
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,760
this. Okay. But remember, this is used as a guidance. This tells us if it's good or not

179
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,240
or if we want to, you know, kind of what to expect or budget for. But when I'm actually here,

180
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,160
okay, when I'm actually in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my tools and settings.

181
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,120
I'm going to click it. I'm going to go to my keyword planner. I'm going to right click that.

182
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:28,400
I'm going to open it in a new link. Okay. I'm going to hit discover new keywords and then I'm going to

183
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:43,760
do a couple of different. What was one? Keys locked in car? Locked keys. Oh yeah. Locked car keys.

184
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,680
Something like that. And then I'm going to change this to Atlanta.

185
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,600
I have specific like areas in Atlanta. Do you want me to tell you or we can go back and do that later?

186
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,920
We will do that, but let's do that a little later. Because what this step is, that's a good

187
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,800
question. This step is just trying, we're trying to like get what Google is going to tell us our

188
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,880
high and low range of CPC so we can set our max limit. And so we don't have to be as specific as

189
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,120
unless you're like going to go completely outside of the metro area, then we don't necessarily need

190
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,720
that. Does that make sense? It's like if we were going to run it in like Stone Mountain, but call

191
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,640
it Atlanta, then we would definitely want to look over that area. But if we're going to be in and

192
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,040
around this area, that's fine. It's like the New Orleans one where we like, we just use New Orleans

193
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,800
because that's going to have the most data, right? Yeah. Okay. So we hit save and then we hit get

194
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,320
results. Okay. And then here we go. So remember like that 1,600, like those are similar

195
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,320
results on what I saw here, maybe a little bit more, a little bit. Yeah, similar, close enough,

196
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:06,160
not totally off. Okay. And then I'm going to go here and it's going to be a little bit more

197
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,840
high and top of page bid low. In a perfect world, we always want to be higher than the high bid,

198
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,440
but you can see like, these are like $2 higher than what we got from Mangles right now for some of

199
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:24,880
these keywords. It's not that one's better or one's worse. It's just, these are just differences in

200
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,560
the tools. And then we're going to go ahead and hit save and then we're going to go ahead and hit

201
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,000
it. It's not that one's better or one's worse. It's just, these are just differences in the tools.

202
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,720
But I like to go here and just see what CPC is like, I want to spend $15 for locked car keys.

203
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,600
Maybe, maybe not. I don't know what the customer makes on it. So, but I also see how low that is.

204
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:57,200
And then I look at these at being like $8, $7, $8. What's this one, another car locksmith. Okay. So

205
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,960
the locksmith ones are higher. That's fine. We want to get those, the tow jobs, mostly these

206
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,280
guys like doing the tow jobs. Sometimes there's people that are specific about getting keys out

207
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:14,320
and all that. So what we'll do is we look around here. So it looks like $8, $7, I see $9 record

208
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,920
service. That's, that's going to be typically like that term is typically like a bigger tow service

209
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,640
or bigger tow truck. So just looking around, let's see.

210
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,880
Okay. So I'm going to kind of use like this one. So we're going to choose $8.75 as our max click,

211
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,280
because that's about, that'll put me a penny higher than a majority of what these main keywords are.

212
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay. So I'm going to go back to here and then hit and that's that. Okay. So I hope that's,

213
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,600
hope you guys understand why we're doing that. And, and we'll go from there.

214
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,920
Eman Coles asks, can we do an analytics and GTM conversion tracking overview for calls and forms?

215
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,640
Yeah, I, yeah, we can set that up for a future office hours. I'm not going to do it today though.

216
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,520
Okay. Now with towing, like this is one that's interesting for like towing,

217
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,200
you can set up only bid for new customers, but I always figure like if someone's like looking

218
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,760
and then they go to look and they come back, like you don't want that ad to not be displayed to them

219
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,400
when they're going to make the call. So I kind of leave it off. It becomes an issue. Then we'll,

220
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,520
we'll change it. Then you go here. So the next step it's going to remember it's going to be on

221
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,760
the search network, but look at this, even here, they want to automatically put you on the search

222
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,560
partners and display network, but we were going to get off of those. So we uncheck those and then

223
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,360
it's going to ask us for our locations. Okay. So here we're going to hit enter location

224
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:57,840
and then Francesca, you have a few sites for us, right? Yes. Let me pull it up.

225
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,080
It's in my email. Just give me one second.

226
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:14,640
Okay. So I have

227
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,840
Lake city, which I have no idea what it's at.

228
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,280
Does it exist?

229
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,480
Yep. There it is. Funny how as I typed it in, it gave me a zip code.

230
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,880
Yeah. Then there's east point.

231
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,640
There it is. East point, Georgia. Then I have union city.

232
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,880
Okay. And then he just said college. I wonder if,

233
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,800
if it's that college park that I saw earlier, when you type the union city.

234
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,480
That's it. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay.

235
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,640
Okay. We could definitely run it. I mean, we have some good, we have some,

236
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,560
we have some good numbers there. Like there's some stretches here of like the interstate.

237
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,600
I'm trying to remember. It's been so long since I've done anything in Atlanta.

238
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,240
Can you do it by, should we do it by radius or not really?

239
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,800
Well, we could, but like, you know, there's areas of Atlanta he may not want to serve or go into,

240
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,040
because it's kind of a pain in the butt getting around there. So

241
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,600
um, there's no way for us to like,

242
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:07,120
and dry. Um, well, yeah, we can. It's just, we don't know where he wants to go. That's specific

243
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:14,000
where he wants to go, but like, we can make like, um, yeah, if you, I'll tell you what, um,

244
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,280
maybe after this call, if you want to like, maybe talk to him or met tomorrow or something and just,

245
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,440
just ask, like, do you want those specific locations or is there like a radius you want

246
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,200
to set up? You can just tell them like, Hey, like something like, Hey, we're, we want to set up

247
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,680
getting some ads going just to like, get you some quick wins while we're ranking stuff. Like, you

248
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,640
know, I got these areas, but is there like a certain like region or, or, you know, maybe give

249
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,960
them some of these other names that you see and see if he's cool with that. Cause sometimes people

250
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,000
are like, Oh, I don't want to go into that neighborhood at all. Um, so you can hit them up.

251
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah. And they will make changes on that. Is that okay? Yeah. Okay. Cause this is a pretty

252
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,480
good population with right now. So, um, okay, we go to there. So we set that up everybody. Um,

253
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:10,240
and then we go to location options. And now towing is an interesting one because like,

254
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,680
we want to do like typically like presence of like people in or regularly in the targeted area,

255
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,120
but a towing, like, especially near an airport, like you could have tourists,

256
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,640
you can have people there for business. You can have, you know, uh, family members watching

257
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,320
people play sports, like playoffs are coming up, like all sorts of stuff. So like in this particular

258
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,480
one, typically like for our like home service technicians, we want to have the presence one

259
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,960
right here. We want that one targeted because we don't want that, but for towing, cause those

260
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,200
people want it now. We don't really care where they're at. We just want them in our area.

261
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,640
So this one, we might want to try this presence or interest. So people that are like,

262
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,200
like here and they're interested in that, that might be something to play with on a towing niche.

263
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,760
But for right now, I'm just going to turn this on and we'll see if we need to switch it later.

264
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:07,760
Okay. And languages, English, the audience segment, like we're not really getting involved with that

265
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:15,840
with what we're doing. Okay. We want this off and we go here. Um, Francesca, 24 hour towing.

266
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:25,920
Yeah. Cool. All right. And then we hit next. Okay. I'm going to go up here and we're going

267
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:38,320
to add our keywords and stuff. Okay. And now it's going to add, it's going to add that one.

268
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:48,720
Here's all of Google's keywords that they want to, that they want to do. Um, those are interesting.

269
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:12,480
Okay. All right. So I've put in, um, the main ones here that Francesca gave me, um, into this

270
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,000
website, add this AdWords wrapper. And this helps me do a proper format that I don't have to

271
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,640
like, um, go into here and like Adam and put the quotations or the brackets or whatever.

272
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,160
And just as a reminder, when I have like a word that has nothing around it, that's called the

273
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,080
broad match. When I have it with the quotation marks around it, that's called the phrase match.

274
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,360
And when I have these brackets around it, that's called an exact match. Um, broad match means like

275
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,520
anything closely related to that. It's going to show an ads on. That's like what we saw

276
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,720
with the search campaigns. If I put quotations around it,

277
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,000
what that's saying is like, let's say I typed in, like, what is the best 24 seven roadside

278
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,480
assistance near me? My ads going to show, because that phrase is included in the search query.

279
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:07,840
If I put the bracket around it, it's only going to show up for that exact search query. Okay.

280
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,160
I prefer for lead gen and what we're trying to do and getting some data is the phrase match.

281
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,640
You can always make tweaks later. Um, you can do broad match, but I only do that if I just have

282
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,680
zero idea what's going to work or not. And I just want to see what sticks. Okay. But typically

283
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:31,760
that's going to be a big waste of ad spend. Um, okay. So we're going to go here. I go here and

284
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:38,240
click wrap keywords, wraps, my keywords. I go here where it says phrase match. I'm going to

285
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,320
click wrap keywords, wraps, my keywords. I go here where it says phrase match. It's

286
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:55,920
formatted in for me. I select it. I copy it. I go back. I go back here. Um, I'm going to

287
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:04,320
do this real quick before I delete those other ones. Um, and Francesca with this, like these

288
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,720
24 hour ones, were you guys getting any, um, like 24 hour stuff on your search terms?

289
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:18,640
I just want to make sure that we have. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to try. I'm going to add like

290
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:26,960
road service. That's, that's probably a decent one. Um, maybe keys locked in car.

291
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,240
So sometimes Google doesn't give you good suggestions, but for something like this,

292
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,160
it's like, that might be, might be helpful. Um, especially like the overnight hour,

293
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,960
someone's going to be looking for like that all day one, you know? Um,

294
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,240
okay. So you guys can see like, right, we're just kind of adding them. You can see that I'm

295
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,720
putting these quotations on them. Right. And so like road service, keys locked in car, like,

296
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,400
you know, that'll, that phrase match will cover 24 hour, 24 seven. Um, you know,

297
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,040
who can get my keys locked in my car? Like type of thing, you know, those type of phrases,

298
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:26,800
roadside assistance. I think we already got roadside. Do you have roadside? Let's do roadside.

299
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,440
Yeah, we have roadside. All right. Cool. Okay. Now I'm going to delete all these

300
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,920
Google suggested ones because Google likes money.

301
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,000
Okay. So we're going to set those up. Okay. And now

302
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,720
I'm going to hit, I can have that set. I'm going to go down here real quick. I'm just going to hit

303
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:07,280
done. It's just like my stupid way of saving it. Okay. All right. Um, okay. So now we're going to

304
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:15,120
go up here. We got towing Atlanta. We believe, and we can just put, um, like towing services.

305
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,520
Okay. And now it's going to ask for headlines. And just like in the last time we want to try

306
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,920
to get this to like good or to excellent good is going to be about three fourths of the way

307
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,800
around the circle. Excellent. It's going to be all the way around the circle. Um, we definitely

308
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,640
want those to be there and we add headlines that are, um, that are geared towards our

309
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:44,080
main keywords and or services. Um, sometimes if you're not sure, like, um, Google will make

310
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:51,520
some suggestions for you. Okay. And you can use some of those and, um, and then get that going

311
00:24:51,520 --> 00:25:14,960
for you. So, um. May not allow that, but we're going to see if it'll let me keep the 24 seven

312
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,400
that.

313
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:29,840
Okay.

314
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,840
Remember how we were doing this the other day? Like they give you these,

315
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,280
like they give you some of these to use, which are great

316
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,280
if they coincide with your website, your web headlines and your keywords. It's great.

317
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:27,280
Um, do they do gas service, gas fuel? Like, do they bring gasoline?

318
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,560
I don't know if that's the actual search term used, but that's what Google picked up. So I'm

319
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,640
just going to go with it now and we'll double check it. As you know, like once we set this up

320
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,800
a couple, two, three days later, it'll tell us something. It'll make different suggestions

321
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:10,640
for us, but we'll try to do that. Um, let's see. Okay. That's awesome. You guys hear the

322
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:18,080
gardener? Go inside and listen to kids. Can you hear the gardener next door?

323
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,640
I don't. Oh, good. Okay. Maybe these headphones work. Awesome.

324
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,200
Is this person a AAA roadside? Do they take AAA? Do you know?

325
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,800
No, no. Okay. I'll put it on the list of things to ask.

326
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:52,400
Okay.

327
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:52,400
Okay.

328
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,000
Okay.

329
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,000
Let's see what other keywords can we throw in there?

330
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,560
I'll leave space for like the AAA. If you can find that out, that'd be cool.

331
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:26,800
Um, maybe like affordable towing. That's not really a big one to trick service.

332
00:29:50,560 --> 00:30:02,080
Do you know if they have like heavy equipment, like heavy wreckers or like are they just doing

333
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:10,640
cars? Do you know? Um, well, like accidents. Yeah. Sometimes like, like some, some local areas,

334
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,520
like a wrecker will be like certain type of tow trucks. Sometimes they're the bigger ones or

335
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,640
like they have the cranes on them or the booms or something. I have to ask. Okay.

336
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,360
Okay. I would, yeah, I would leave it if you want.

337
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Yeah. Okay. Let's see. What else can we do here?

338
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,720
Boom.

339
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,720
We'll see if I can get one.

340
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
There you go. Um,

341
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:01,280
like did you already put flat tire, um, like repair or something like that? So I think you put.

342
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:07,520
I think I did. I put something. I put flat tire replacement. I'll put flat tire repair.

343
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,960
And I'm going to leave this one open in case we do AAA or like an insurance brand or something.

344
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,480
I'll leave that one open, but we're already at excellent. So that's good.

345
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,680
Um, and we didn't even try a description yet. Um, okay. Do you guys have, I know you guys have used

346
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,800
towing before. Do you guys have some descriptions that you've used in the past that you're aware of?

347
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,400
The only, um, till we know we do, we actually don't even run ads anymore.

348
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,680
But I can.

349
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,440
That's okay. I'm going to stop the share real quick and I'm going to go through my computer.

350
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,800
Fine. Some stuff that I've written down. Well, we may have.

351
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:31,200
I'll bring my screen back up. Everybody. I'm just moving stuff around in my window. So,

352
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,120
and then I'll share it again.

353
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:45,520
Like when I don't know, I just use Nick's stuff because it works.

354
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,200
Don't know why it works, but it works. Right. Okay.

355
00:32:49,200 --> 00:33:02,320
Okay. Okay. Here we are. We are back. Okay. So we just, I just copied, uh,

356
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:12,240
what we use right with the group. So, um, that's fine. Uh, we specialize and

357
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,360
and towing

358
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,680
not keys,

359
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,960
but tire repair

360
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,640
and more call for free quote, the local, affordable

361
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,680
professional, the truck company

362
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,360
and the Atlanta area. Okay. So we'll call those good for right now. We'll come up with some other

363
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,040
ones later, um, and do that. Okay. So for everyone following along. So, so far, we've set everything

364
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:09,200
up. Um, we spent the time to put in the headlines. It showed you how like Google will help you

365
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,600
sometimes. Sometimes it doesn't, but a lot of times it does. But you want to remember, like we

366
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,640
also went into keyword planner, where I looked at some volume and stuff and I'm able to see some of

367
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,920
the main keywords and I just use some variants. And just by doing that, I'm going to be able to

368
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,280
keywords and I just use some variants. And just by doing that, like I already started off my ad

369
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,960
strength into excellent, which is good in three, four days, it's going to be different, but it's

370
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,440
always helpful to start off there. And then you can always change it from there. The descriptions

371
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,440
that just stick with the simple one that works. You don't have to get too fancy, but you can do

372
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:51,280
that. Um, so because this is a, a single, um, uh, a single one pager, we're not going to do site

373
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,640
links. Um, we're not going to do call outs. Okay. But one thing we're going to add here,

374
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,760
so we're going to, so I went here, it says more assets. I'm going to scroll down and I'm going

375
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,600
to add a phone number and add calls. So I'm going to add that to this, right? I'm going to go to the

376
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:21,120
website, copy that, put that in there, like, give us a call. Right. Okay. And I can now

377
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:28,480
this part, because it's a 24 hour service, I can leave this on for the calls. But let's say that

378
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,880
like I was setting up, setting this up for like, um, you know, like Francesca's tree trimming site,

379
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,080
um, like maybe she doesn't want to get calls all night and all day. So like I will,

380
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,440
I will set her, her, um, maybe set up the call part, like this little call add-on. I only let

381
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,440
this run during like maybe 30 to 45 minutes before and after close of business. Um, and then

382
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,840
everything else will be running other than that. So then we'll hit save. We'll say, cool. We hit

383
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,280
apply. It applies that to that. You don't have to worry about snippets, lead forms, any of that

384
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,960
other stuff at this point. We hit done. We hit next. Now it's going to ask for our daily budget.

385
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,640
Um, so it doesn't, let me see if I can do this here. So sometimes,

386
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,040
sometimes it gives us estimates. A lot of times it doesn't.

387
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:34,000
Okay. Um, but knowing that like Atlanta, it was like eight something. So, um, there's definitely

388
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,080
a lot of money in, in towing. Um, so what we're going to do is we're going to start off with like

389
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:47,440
$55 a day. Um, and then as soon as I type that in, I haven't agreed to this yet, but you can see

390
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,880
right here, like it given me an idea of how many weekly clicks I can get, what the weekly cost is,

391
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,680
and then what the average CPC is. Like, I don't know how accurate that is right away, but it gives

392
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,960
you a good starting point. Okay. So we're going to start off with that. And only cause this is

393
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,800
towing and it's in the Atlanta area. So it's going to be, and, and, and Francesca can,

394
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,920
can chime in on this. Like you make your money and a lot of volume and towing. And so you want

395
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,000
their phones ringing all the time. That's how they pay you. And that's why they keep paying more.

396
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,840
Right. Okay. And you guys are working on going to probably, you guys have a full website coming up

397
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:30,320
and doing the SEO and all that stuff. I'm sure at some point. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we'll go ahead and

398
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,880
hit next.

399
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,560
Okay. So you guys see up here, you'll see in the video I made earlier today,

400
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,480
I talked about how we want this to be up to a hundred. Don't worry about that right now,

401
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,560
because Google's like wanting to add all these things that just going to take your money away.

402
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,680
But remember, like we're going to hit publish. It's going to take two days of policy review

403
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,840
and then five days of learning before anything really like good happens. So we're not, I don't

404
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,080
mess with them. When I first set it up, I set it up, I let it sit for two or three days. And then

405
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:14,080
I come in and then I make some of the recommendation changes to increase my optimization score.

406
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,720
And then we do that with this one. We'll pop on and we'll either record it and post it,

407
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,120
or I'll pop in live like I did earlier and show you the changes and how to get it back up to a

408
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:33,840
hundred on this site. And let's go through here. I just kind of overview what I'm seeing. Yeah.

409
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,640
Okay. And you can see up here guys, like this is one of the things like it wants me to add

410
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,920
site links to get my optimization score up, but I don't have any other web pages because it's a

411
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,920
single pager. So it makes no sense to do site links. Right. And I'll show you how to get around

412
00:38:47,920 --> 00:39:00,400
that. And we hit publish. And there we go. So we are now under review. Here you go. We got policy

413
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,200
review and it'll give us some impressions and some clicks. And then it'll kick us into the

414
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:11,040
learning right here. Eligible learning. That's a five day, that's a five day process post

415
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,280
passing policy review. And then it just gives you a summary of everything.

416
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,680
And then I think that's it. Francesca, is there anything that I can

417
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,000
go over that you think I missed or didn't explain well enough or anything like that?

418
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,040
I think you did really good. The only thing that I can think of, maybe people will be like,

419
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:40,320
wow, that's a lot of money per day. But it is a little different because I usually will keep in

420
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,520
mind the first one or two days, obviously it's not really doing anything. And even afterwards,

421
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:53,360
but I do keep checking it to see how much we're actually spending. We just want to set it high

422
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:01,760
enough that it will produce, especially at first. Yeah. Yeah. And also re-emphasize on that point,

423
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,280
this is Atlanta. It's a large metro area. So this is not something that you want to do as a beginning

424
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,720
student. This is not where you want to set up your first Legion app, right? Nick and Francesca have

425
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,240
been doing this for a few years. They got a lot of experience. They get clients that come to them

426
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,880
from big areas because they know they can do big stuff. So when you do that, you get people,

427
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,960
you have to run bigger budgets for them. You can't run a $15 a day budget and expect results for

428
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,120
Atlanta for Tony. This is not going to happen. But that's a great point. We've had some other areas

429
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:42,160
where like, you know, just because you put $55 a day doesn't mean it's going to spend $55 a day.

430
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,360
This campaign may because there's a lot of volume and we'll make those adjustments,

431
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,040
but like we have the, there's the landscape or yeah, there's a landscape one we were working on

432
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:00,880
and we've had to adjust the budget higher to a lot for more potential clicks per day. But I don't

433
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,480
think we've hit the budget once, like the daily budget. We haven't even come close to it, right?

434
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:16,640
Yeah. So, okay. I think that's it. Okay. We're going to look at the group and see if there's

435
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,480
been any questions and then we'll get out of here for the day. We'll call it a day.

436
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:30,080
We have one person watching. So big, probably me. I think it's me watching me and you right now.

437
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:35,120
So that's cool. All right, guys, does anybody have any comments? Because we're going to,

438
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:41,680
we're going to kill this in a minute if nobody does. So we tried.

439
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:50,400
It will be pinned anyway. So I know it exists. I see that they watch this. I see the comments.

440
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:57,600
Yeah. It's funny. All right. We'll give them. Yeah. Thank you. I'm going to give them like

441
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:04,560
15 seconds and then we're going to kick out. So just because of the delay. Yeah. The delay is weird.

442
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,480
I always laugh at Nick because like, he's like, okay, bye. And you're like,

443
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,480
what? He just, where'd he go? He doesn't even finish the by when he sits out. I think it's funny.

444
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,640
And my videos are probably the same. I have to say, I've never watched one of my videos to the end.

445
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,600
So I don't know. All right. Okay. I'm not seeing any comments come in. So we're going to,

446
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,720
we're going to end it. Thank you again for hopping on and helping. Thank you. Everyone

447
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,520
appreciate your experience and expertise in it. So, all right. We'll talk to you later. All right.

448
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,920
Bye. Okay. Bye.
