what's your question man so no honestly the course is amazing digital landlords i wish

00:06.320 --> 00:12.720
i've been putting more time into it i'm so busy with sco clients and they take up so much of my

00:12.720 --> 00:18.000
time i keep putting out fires every single day i just want to give a big shout out to you but

00:18.000 --> 00:24.080
also want to ask you would you recommend kind of burning the boats and ditching some of these

00:24.160 --> 00:29.680
clients in order to free up more time or do you have any recommendations for outsourcing

00:30.320 --> 00:37.840
so i definitely like when i started scaling first of all is this it's kind of a contextual

00:37.840 --> 00:42.720
question because if you need it to pay the bills and it's keeping you out of your job then that's

00:42.720 --> 00:48.640
one thing but i also know that it could be the thing that's causing you not to scale because

00:48.640 --> 00:53.840
your attention is definitely going to be split what i did again this is just from experience

00:53.840 --> 00:59.600
is in 2020 when i started scaling is i found a strategic partner i created the strategic partner

00:59.600 --> 01:05.840
it was my employee that was doing my seo he started a company we did a 50 50 split he would

01:05.840 --> 01:09.680
sign the deal i'd sign the deals i'd send them to him i wouldn't talk to the client again he would

01:09.680 --> 01:15.760
pay me 50 of the net profit that allowed me to keep some of the money but also just to focus

01:15.760 --> 01:21.920
strictly on lead generation so that's what i did it worked out really really well i still was able

01:21.920 --> 01:27.440
to make about and and every time i use i say i made 100k a month i hope you guys know that was

01:27.440 --> 01:33.440
just with lead gen this was when i talked seo that was just like gravy um we did we were doing like

01:33.440 --> 01:39.520
seven to twelve thousand a month my split of seo which means i could have taken 20 if i would have

01:39.520 --> 01:44.560
done it myself but i just decided you know i could take 15 to 20 but i decided i'm going to take

01:44.560 --> 01:48.880
half of that focus on lead gen because that's where i could actually scale so that's what i

01:48.880 --> 01:53.760
would recommend as far as like outsourcing i don't really have any one that i've used that

01:53.760 --> 01:59.520
i would recommend uh look i can ask around and and get that for you it's just difficult when

01:59.520 --> 02:04.480
you're when you're doing like white labeling because people do the bare minimum uh you know

02:04.480 --> 02:09.200
they just want to get paid and they don't really care uh but you can shoot me a message and i can

02:10.240 --> 02:14.640
you know maybe there's some some some kind of a way we could you could even use my team

02:15.200 --> 02:17.920
uh i don't know but yes if you want to send me a message i'm happy to do that man

02:18.560 --> 02:22.720
