And a lot of times that pullback, they're like, Oh, okay, this is different. This guy is actually like a real person, not a robot. And, and you'll get them to answer right there. So that's what I would have done different. I would still keep hitting them. Maybe like if the lead comes in, do a screenshot, blur out the number. Hey, I got this lead. I want to send it to you.
