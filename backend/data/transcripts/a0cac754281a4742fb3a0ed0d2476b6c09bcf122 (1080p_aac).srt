1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,960
Now that we've picked the right niche and the right city, we want to figure out are

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,120
there actually people in that niche and city that are going to be willing to buy our product,

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,440
to buy our leads, right?

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,760
Because you can pick the right niche and the right city.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,760
You could do everything correct.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,120
You could start getting leads, but if there's no one in that city that wants to buy what

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,040
you're selling, it's not worth anything.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,200
So what we're going to talk about is we're going to talk about who we should actually

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
target.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,120
And what I mean by that is who are the people, who are the business owners that we're going

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,240
to go after when we're trying to sell these leads?

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,280
A lot of people say, I hate sales, Nick, you know, sales isn't my forte, I'm just not comfortable

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
doing sales.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,400
I like the technical side and it's just, it's just not me, right?

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,680
But I'm going to, I'm going to argue and tell you this.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,960
If you say you hate sales or you haven't had a good experience with sales or the people

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,160
that say that, they are talking to the wrong people.

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,920
Because when you are selling something that somebody wants, if you're talking to somebody

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,320
about something they want, it is a very, very, very enjoyable conversation.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,320
So if you're somebody that's like, oh, I hate sales, or it's just not for me, or you never

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,560
had a good experience doing sales, it's because you were trying to sell something to the wrong

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,840
person, okay?

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,240
And I experienced this, I did door to door sales.

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,480
I'd go door to door to door.

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,560
And I had no idea if people on the other side of the door wanted home security systems,

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,400
I had no idea if they wanted cameras, I had no idea if they wanted door locks, I didn't

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
know.

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,760
With this, what we're going to do is we are only going to target people who are already

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,200
sold, people who are already paying for advertising, which is basically like them saying, they're

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,280
raising their hand saying, hey, call me, I am interested, I am paying right now with

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,480
my own dollars for leads.

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,840
And so those are the people that we're going to target.

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,520
Okay, guys, the game here is we are going to target people that are already sold.

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,240
And the telltale sign that somebody's already sold is they're already paying for advertising,

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,760
whether it's Google Ads, HomeAdvisor, Angie's List, you name it, that is a telltale sign

36
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,920
that they are already sold.

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,720
So what we're going to do is we're going to come up, we're going to build a list.

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,880
Before we ever build a website, before we ever spend a dollar, we are actually going

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,520
to build a list of people that are already spending money on these services.

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,840
And the reason we're going to do that is two part.

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,480
Number one is so that we know that there's a buyer in that market or multiple buyers,

42
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,480
number one.

43
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,600
But number two is when leads start coming in, we don't want to be scrambling.

44
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,920
We don't want leads to be going cold.

45
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,800
We want to have a list already in place where we can just take the lead, hit the list, and

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,440
we can get somebody on the hook, okay?

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,200
So I want to share my favorite, people that are paying for advertising.

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,240
There's different, you know, places that we're going to look and I'm going to share my favorites

49
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
in order.

50
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,960
Number one is my number one favorite person to target is somebody paying for Google Ads.

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,380
Number two is somebody that's paying for Home Advisor.

52
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,080
Number three, somebody that's paying for Angie's leads list.

53
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,880
I don't even know what it's called anymore.

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,920
And then after that, it's, you know, Thumbtack, Yelp, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

55
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,080
And the reason I like Google Ads so much is because of this.

56
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,200
Well, first of all, number one is if somebody's paying for Google Ads and you see they're

57
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,280
paying for Google Ads at that very moment and you see, hey, they're paying for ads,

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,360
that means they're paying for ads right then.

59
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,480
And so they currently at that moment are spending money.

60
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,840
Whereas with Home Advisor, they could be on Home Advisor or they could be on Angie's

61
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,160
list listed as a business, but they have shut it off, paused it, et cetera.

62
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,280
So number one is I know they're paying for ads right now.

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,980
And number two is with Google Ads, what they're getting is clicks.

64
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,280
They're literally paying for somebody to click on their link.

65
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,480
They're not getting calls.

66
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,880
They're not paying for any of this stuff.

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,080
They're getting clicks.

68
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,800
And so what's cool is I can come in and say, hey, you're paying for clicks and I can get

69
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,720
you jobs, right?

70
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,320
You're paying for clicks because you want jobs.

71
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,600
I can get you the jobs.

72
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,960
Last reason why I like Google Ads so much is typically the budgets are a lot higher.

73
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,400
With Home Advisor, you'll see a lot of people paying 300 bucks, 200 bucks, 500 bucks.

74
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,220
With Google Ads, it's very, very common for people to be spending 1,000, 1,500, 2,000.

75
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,960
And so they're already used to paying a decent chunk of change.

76
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,940
So what we're going to do in this entire module is we are going to build a list of business

77
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,540
owners that are already sold on what we're selling.
