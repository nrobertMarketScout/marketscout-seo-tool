00:00.320 --> 00:02.520
If you didn't ask somebody for money today,

00:02.520 --> 00:05.400
if you didn't prospect, guys, every single one of you,

00:05.400 --> 00:08.940
if you're not on the phone every single day,

00:10.240 --> 00:12.640
Monday through Friday, go ahead, take the weekend off,

00:12.640 --> 00:13.560
I don't care.

00:13.560 --> 00:14.600
I know when I was coming up,

00:14.600 --> 00:16.440
I was working Saturday mornings minimum,

00:16.440 --> 00:18.800
and I have kids and I got other stuff too,

00:18.800 --> 00:21.180
but I was working Saturday mornings doing sales calls.

00:21.180 --> 00:23.300
I was doing something sales related

00:23.300 --> 00:24.800
every single day of the week.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.360
You may not have the ability to ask somebody for money

00:28.360 --> 00:30.360
every single day because you don't have enough deals

00:30.360 --> 00:31.200
in the pipe.

00:32.180 --> 00:35.360
Every single one of you should be on the phone

00:35.360 --> 00:38.200
doing prospecting calls every single day.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.520
But Nick, I don't have a campaign that's generating leads.

00:40.520 --> 00:41.360
Who cares?

00:41.360 --> 00:43.640
Go pick a random city and practice, okay?

00:43.640 --> 00:46.100
Get good at doing it while you're waiting,

00:46.100 --> 00:47.560
or go hook somebody in advance.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.520
Find the area that you wanna go into

00:49.520 --> 00:52.680
and hook somebody while you wait for the leads to come in.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.220
I mean, heaven forbid, okay?

00:55.220 --> 00:58.120
Guys, the work that actually moves the needle

00:58.840 --> 01:00.280
is talking to business owners, doing sales.

01:00.280 --> 01:01.560
That's the work that matters.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.600
How much have you done this week?

01:03.600 --> 01:06.680
My guess is that 99% of you guys haven't done jack shit.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.520
That's the truth.

01:08.520 --> 01:09.680
That's the truth.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.500
Well, I watched some training videos.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.200
I watched the live.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.600
I spent an hour looking at due diligence.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.200
Cool, good job.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.020
Go do 100, then outsource it.

01:19.020 --> 01:20.380
Go do 100 due diligence.

01:20.380 --> 01:23.280
Master the process of finding a city and niche.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.400
Go hire someone for pennies in the Philippines

01:26.520 --> 01:29.000
and get that off your plate and focus on sales, okay?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.200
Oh, but I wrote content.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.040
Awesome.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.640
Go write 20,000 words of content

01:32.640 --> 01:34.020
for your first five websites.

01:34.020 --> 01:37.100
Train somebody from the Philippines or Africa or whatever.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.940
Create a process, outsource it.

01:38.940 --> 01:40.040
Spend more time on sales.

01:40.040 --> 01:40.880
You wanna make more money?

01:40.880 --> 01:42.680
Spend more time on sales, okay?

01:42.680 --> 01:44.360
Don't sit there and think that you're doing work

01:44.360 --> 01:45.480
because you're watching videos

01:45.480 --> 01:47.400
or you're listening to fricking Joe Rogan

01:47.400 --> 01:50.380
or you're listening to Jocko Willink

01:50.380 --> 01:53.100
talking about getting in the ice bath.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.000
Do sales.

01:54.000 --> 01:54.840
Call people.
