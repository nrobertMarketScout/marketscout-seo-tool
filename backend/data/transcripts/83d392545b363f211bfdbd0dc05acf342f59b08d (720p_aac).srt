1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Okay, Spencer, what are some tells that a BO is legitimately hungry to grow beyond just yes,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,560
the direct question? Well, obvious one is that they're paying for ads, right? And here's how

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,360
I look at it. If you're paying for leads or you're paying for ads and you tell me you're

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,680
not hungry to grow, you're a dumbass. That means you're allergic to money, right? So number one is,

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,160
I think the biggest telltale sign is they're paying for ads. Now, does it get a little bit trickier

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,320
if they're on Home Advisor and you're like, oh, well, are they active on Home Advisor? Did they

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,360
have Home Advisor in the past? Now it's shut off. There's a difference between being on Home

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,200
Advisor, being on Andy's List and actually actively paying, right? But if they're paying

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,320
for Google Ads, it's a pretty good sign. But that's a good question, Spencer. I think, yeah,

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,440
Spencer asked that. For me, it's a feeling. For me, it's a soft skill. For me, I got to hear

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,920
their tone of their voice. I got to do that cold call and I can tell. And here's the advice I want

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,240
to give you is when you are in doubt, when you are in doubt if that business owner is actually

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,080
legitimately hungry to grow, heat check them, pull back right there on the spot, okay? Here's

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,080
the example. All right, get to the end of the call. Hey, Mr. Business Owner, you got done. You got

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,280
the phone number. I'm going to send you a couple of leads. Hey, let me just ask you this really

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,160
quick. And I hate to be like, you know, repeating myself, but like, are you hungry to grow? Because

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,040
look, I want to work with you. I'm willing to give you a couple of leads at no charge. But if

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,880
I'm going to just, if I'm going to call you with a lead that's live and you're not going to answer

19
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,040
the phone, just tell me right now so that I don't waste my time, okay? Because I'm only going to

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,560
work with one company. Are you actually hungry to grow? You just tell me what I want to hear.

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,160
I know when I say that out loud, that's like, oh shit, that's pretty bold.

22
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,600
Yeah, it is. But guess what? You right there by doing that pullback, you are going to give them

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,080
the chance that if they actually are not interested, they actually are not hungry,

24
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,440
they can just run along. They can let you know right there on the spot. Yeah, actually Spencer,

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,960
it's funny you asked that. I don't know, man. I don't know if we're like, we're actually that

26
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,680
hungry and blah, blah, blah. Okay, cool. Thanks for telling me. Thanks for telling me. Now,

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,000
is it just because you don't understand what I'm doing here or are you like, and maybe like,

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,000
don't be afraid to check people, man. A lot of times we get that, yes, yeah, it sounds good,

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,600
but we're like deep down, we know they're actually not interested. They're just telling us what we

30
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,480
want to hear, but we're so damn afraid to ask the hard questions because of what we might hear.

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,520
Be okay to ask that question, even if it means you might get the answer you don't want to hear,

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,280
because I'd rather do that than waste the next three days and three leads on somebody

33
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,680
who's ghosting me. Okay, that's the best thing. And all the other things, telltale signs,

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,440
when in doubt, do a pullback at the end of that first call. And if at the end of the first call,

35
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,360
it seems good. And then by the next call, they're dicking around with you, ghosting you,

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,360
do the pullback, leave them a message, call them, ask them, hey, man, I know we talked yesterday,

37
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,960
I gave you that lead, but I'm not getting the greatest vibes. Like, are you hungry to grow?

38
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,120
If not, I'll find somebody else and I'm not trying to be a dick. Do a pullback. Okay.
