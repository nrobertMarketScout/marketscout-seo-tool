Marcus says, what type of ROI do you like to see on your ad spend?

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:09,440
If you spend 10K in ad spend, what do you want to see come in for revenue?

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:20,320
So Marcus, I am willing to spend up to about 60% of my total deal size on ads.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,840
So if it's a thousand dollar deal, I'll spend up to 60%.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,720
So do the math on that.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,880
But if I get a thousand dollar deal, I'll spend 20 bucks a day

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,320
because then that gives me enough to spend money on content writers and employees and etc.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,680
And still make a profit.

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,480
Anything above that, it's too thin.

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
The margins are too thin and I don't like it.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,480
So about 60%, I'll spend up to 60% on my ads.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,720
Yeah, that's what I would recommend.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,120
Okay.
