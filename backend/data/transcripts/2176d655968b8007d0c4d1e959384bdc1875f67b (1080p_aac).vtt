00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
So once we get a client, what's our process from there?

00:03.440 --> 00:06.480
What's the first thing that we do with the client?

00:06.480 --> 00:08.320
We sign the contract.

00:08.320 --> 00:10.240
What's the first thing that we do from there?

00:10.240 --> 00:13.360
Yeah, we sign the contract, get the credit card,

00:13.360 --> 00:16.640
get a credit card authorization, then run the credit card.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.440
Make sure that it goes through.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.720
We just ran the credit card.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.920
We just did the pre-authorization.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.920
But do we send out an email?

00:25.920 --> 00:27.680
Do we schedule a phone call?

00:27.760 --> 00:30.560
What does our next step look like to set those expectations?

00:31.600 --> 00:31.920
Yeah.

00:31.920 --> 00:37.280
So when I'm closing the deal, I like to also add in expectations

00:38.080 --> 00:39.760
and how everything will work.

00:39.760 --> 00:43.520
I include that into the closing call.

00:44.160 --> 00:48.320
And then I, well, the contract, the card, whatever that part we already said.

00:48.320 --> 00:50.880
And then I send them an email with things that I need from them.

00:51.440 --> 00:55.120
That I do have a template, but sometimes it depends on the business owner

00:55.120 --> 00:59.760
because for example, we need to set up a GMB or photos.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.920
It's just a list of things that I need from the owner.

01:03.920 --> 01:05.200
And I include that in the email.

01:05.200 --> 01:09.920
It's like a welcome email where you get them a little pumped up

01:09.920 --> 01:13.520
and you ask them information that you need to get started,

01:13.520 --> 01:15.440
like phone number and stuff like that.

01:15.440 --> 01:19.120
All the things that you need in order to make the website for them

01:19.120 --> 01:21.680
and literally make the whole project.

01:22.320 --> 01:26.080
So as soon as the deal is closed, then we just let them know,

01:26.080 --> 01:28.080
hey, you're going to get an email from me.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.600
I'm going to ask you for a couple of things.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.680
I need you to give us this information.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.440
And then from there, we can get things started.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.680
So that's step number one is an email goes out.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.200
Yeah.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.480
So email goes out.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.160
What happens after the email?

01:40.160 --> 01:44.160
So after that, I just wait for them to respond with the information.

01:44.160 --> 01:48.240
And then after they send that over, I don't really contact them

01:49.200 --> 01:52.080
until everything is done.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.680
And then when everything is built out,

01:53.680 --> 01:56.400
which usually doesn't take us more than a week,

01:56.400 --> 01:58.080
less than a week usually,

01:58.080 --> 02:01.840
then I update them and tell them, hey, we're all done with the site

02:01.840 --> 02:03.680
and just kind of give them an update.

02:03.680 --> 02:08.000
And then after that, it depends on the client, to be honest.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.600
Does the update happen on the phone?

02:09.600 --> 02:10.480
Does it happen on email?

02:10.480 --> 02:11.440
Does it happen on text?

02:12.560 --> 02:16.800
See, that also depends because some clients will not answer their phones

02:16.800 --> 02:17.840
and they just text me back.

02:17.840 --> 02:18.800
They're like, hey, what's up?

02:18.800 --> 02:21.040
And that way, I just usually send them a text.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.800
Most of the time, I like to call them or email them is even better.

02:24.800 --> 02:25.760
That way, I don't know.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.880
I just like having the record, but it does depend on the client.

02:31.440 --> 02:34.160
After that, yeah, I just check in with them.

02:34.160 --> 02:37.600
And obviously, another thing that you'll do to contact them is

02:38.400 --> 02:41.120
after that is built, you want to test the site,

02:41.120 --> 02:43.360
which also that would also mean, obviously,

02:43.360 --> 02:46.960
that you're going to call them when you're testing the Legion site.

02:46.960 --> 02:50.080
So that's another way to kind of check in on the first week.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.640
So the first week, you talk to them often.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.080
You send them the email.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.680
You call them to test the site.

02:55.680 --> 02:59.360
You call them or text them or email them to let them know, hey, this is finished.

03:00.160 --> 03:04.880
And yeah, after that, I check in with them every month.
