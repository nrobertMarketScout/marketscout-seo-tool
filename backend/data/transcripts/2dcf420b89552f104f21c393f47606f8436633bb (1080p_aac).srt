1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,520
Step four of the process guys is the big transition and again this is about my third or fourth

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,520
time explaining this.

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,520
There are miniature transitions in between each step and then this is the big transition.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,680
This is the transition where we go from kind of pitching them and hooking them into, alright

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,520
let me grab your information and actually send you some leads, okay.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,400
So what I like to do is after I explain the deal, which is I give you a couple leads,

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,160
we talk in a couple days, then I just transition really simple like okay cool what's the best

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,160
number and email to send the leads to, okay.

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,840
And they'll start giving it to me and they'll say oh well you know here's my email, okay

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,780
cool and then here's my phone number and this is then what we're gonna dive into.

11
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,840
Then what we're gonna do guys is we're gonna explain how these first couple jobs are going

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
to be handled.

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,800
They're going to be live transferred over.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,000
So they just gave us the email, they just gave us the phone number and they go like

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
this.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,400
Alright Jack so how this is gonna work, I need you to save and by the way guys, if this

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,480
is you that's gonna be transferring these first couple leads, which it probably will

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,360
be, tell them to save your number.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,640
If you're gonna use a different number, tell them to save that number.

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,320
If you're gonna use a service, tell them to save that number.

21
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,700
If you're gonna use an in-house person, tell them to save that number.

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,880
Tell them the number that's gonna be calling them, but say something like this.

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,600
Alright Jack so how this is gonna work is these first couple.

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,760
I need you to save this phone number and save it all caps, name my company's evergreen,

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,160
put Nick, put answer, put money, put something because for these first couple what I'm gonna

26
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,440
do is I really don't want you having to spend a bunch of time doing this.

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:47,220
So I'm actually gonna call you with the customer on the phone and I'm gonna hand her directly

28
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,520
off to you and I'll make it easy, I'll just pretend that I work for you or whatever so

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,320
it doesn't seem like we have to explain a whole bunch of stuff.

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,560
But next time I call you and this phone is ringing, it is going to be me with the customer

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,000
on the phone and I'll just make a really smooth transition, introduce you guys, I'll step

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,360
out and you can schedule her for an estimate.

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
Sound good?

34
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,200
And by the way Mr. Business Owner, this isn't how we always do it, but just for these first

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,760
couple I don't want you having to chase leads around, call them, etc.

36
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,520
I wanna make this as easy on you as possible.

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,100
I want you to just get a taste of what this is like.

38
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,100
And that's how I explain it.

39
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,880
I don't ask, hey do you, like guys this is one of the mistakes I'm seeing people make

40
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,840
right now is they're saying, hey do you care if I live transfer?

41
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,660
We typically like to live transfer, are you good at that?

42
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,680
Do not ask questions, do not give them the option or they're just gonna confuse them.

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,960
Just say hey, here's how we roll baby.

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:39,680
First couple leads I'm gonna be calling you so save this number, tell them what to do.

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,320
Save this number, when I call and the next couple calls when I call you, I am going to

46
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,880
have a customer on the phone so do everything you can and look I understand you can't answer

47
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,720
all of them but do everything you can to answer because these are gonna be hot leads that

48
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,320
really, really want estimates, I'm not gonna waste your time.

49
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,120
Save my number, I'll call you with the customer on the phone, I'll act like I work for you,

50
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,960
we'll make this super simple.

51
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,280
Do not give them the option, that's it.

52
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,360
That's how you explain the live transfer process and the biggest mistakes I've seen is people

53
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,040
asking for permission, hey do you care if I live transfer these?

54
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,200
Nope, you tell them what you're gonna do.

55
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,480
People love being told what to do, I promise you, I know that sounds funny like I'm just

56
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,720
being hilarious, no, they like it.

57
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,480
They like when you sound professional, when you're bold, tell them what you're gonna do

58
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,400
and let them know, hey this isn't gonna be forever, I'm gonna do this for the first couple

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,400
so you can get a taste of what this is like after we put something together, if we end

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,640
up doing something, don't put too much pressure, after we end up doing something or if we end

61
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,360
up doing something, I'm just gonna send these directly to you or directly to someone that

62
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,800
scheduled your appointments but for these first, I just wanna hand them off live to

63
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,960
you so you can get a taste for it.

64
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,920
Guys, that's it, that is the transition process from who you are, we transition into what

65
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,560
you're doing, damn good reason, same thing, the deal which we just did in the last video

66
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,360
and now this is the actual transition step into getting the name, or sorry, getting the

67
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,360
phone number, getting the email, explaining the live transfer process and we're golden.
