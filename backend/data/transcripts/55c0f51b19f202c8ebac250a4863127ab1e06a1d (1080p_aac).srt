1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Okay, guys, let's talk about how passive this model really is, and I'm going to be speaking

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,640
to those of you that maybe are brand new to this group, like a Kurt Dahlstrom.

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,660
Maybe I'm speaking to you that have been in this group for a minute.

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,920
You understand the model.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,140
You might even have started building your first project, or maybe you've even landed

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,580
your first client, but you haven't really seen how passive this can become.

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,320
It's really important, Kurt Thomas, welcome from Cleveland, Ohio, welcome to The Call.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,860
It's very easy for people to toss around the term passive, passive income, passive income,

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,020
passive income.

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,340
First and foremost, everyone's old enough and mature enough, and hopefully has enough

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,660
experience to realize there's really no such thing as 100% passivity, okay?

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,300
There's varying degrees of passivity, but there's not passive or non-passive.

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,940
It's just degrees, okay?

14
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,020
Even regular real estate is not completely passive.

15
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,900
You got to evict people sometimes.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,220
You got to fix this.

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,220
You got to fix that.

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,120
You got to raise prices, re-sign contracts.

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,300
It's never 100% pass, okay?

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,300
Nothing is, and I'm not going to lie to you guys, for those of you that are new, for those

21
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,220
of you that are exploring this model, or for those of you that have gotten into it but

22
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,620
haven't quite gotten that website ranked, I'm not going to lie and say it's completely

23
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,980
passive because nothing is completely passive, okay?

24
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,980
So we're going to start there.

25
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:37,420
Also, what I would like to do is give away a little bit of swag.

26
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:43,540
Let me see if I can show everybody, let me see if I can show everybody what we got, okay?

27
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,260
First and foremost, some of the stuff that we have, we have the t-shirts, we have the

28
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:54,900
mouse pads, we have the AirPod cases, we have the coffee mugs, we have the stickers.

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,100
We got a few little knickknacks, whatever, that can sit on your desk.

30
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,940
We got some hoodies, some hats.

31
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,940
So we're going to be giving away some swag today.

32
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,460
So I appreciate you guys being active on the call.

33
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,340
I'm going to be choosing a few winners and give away some stuff, okay?

34
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,460
So just stick with me.

35
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,180
There's Nick Bass, Nick Bassaraba from Canada as well, and we're going to be talking about

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,380
a bunch of stuff today, but I'm going to also be doing that, okay?

37
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,340
So for those of you that maybe are new to this group, Kurt, some of you guys have heard

38
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,020
my story, some of you haven't.

39
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,180
I'm not going to share it again, but if you watch any of my content, you'll hear the story.

40
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,900
Been doing this eight years.

41
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:42,020
I've made by renting, by building and renting simple websites, have made well over a million

42
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:47,640
dollars for the past four years, with the exception of 2020 and 2021.

43
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,440
Those years, we made a million in 2020, just over.

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:59,800
We did 1.45, 1.5 in 2021, but it's been well over that since, and we will never go back.

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,160
But I want you guys to know that we made this money, we're making this money doing the model

46
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,160
that we're teaching in this program, which is building and renting simple websites.

47
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,140
And that's what you need to know about me.

48
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,280
That's what you should be asking yourself is why the heck should I listen to this guy

49
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,760
who's just another, you know, somebody full of crap, whatever, you know, it's crazy how

50
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,800
distrusting I am and how distrusting guys, let me tell you the most hilarious thing that

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,440
happened about a month and about five weeks ago, it was just before I went to Dubai.

52
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,880
And my, I have, I have a Lamborghini Huracan parked in my garage.

53
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,720
By the way, I waited until I could pay completely just cash for this thing, or else I wasn't

54
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
going to do it.

55
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
And this, I bought this thing.

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,200
It'd be a year on October 31st, like it's been almost a year guys in 2020.

57
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,760
I've driven it three times.

58
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Okay.

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,000
One of those times was about five weeks ago, my son was going to school.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
There's only two seats.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,440
You can't even take all the kids, but he's like, yeah, let's take the car, drop me off

62
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
in the Lamborghini.

63
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
I'm like, okay, cool.

64
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,720
Pull up, drop him off.

65
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,080
His friends are going crazy, whatever.

66
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,840
And I was talking about their school and he goes, yeah, my buddies, my buddies, they asked

67
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,160
me if you rent, if you were renting the Lamborghini.

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,000
And I just, I laugh and he didn't even know that was a thing, which is good.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,880
But he's, he told, I said, what'd you say?

70
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,720
He's like, yeah, I just told him, I don't think that's even an option.

71
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,480
The point that I'm making guys is there's so much fake stuff out there that even people

72
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,880
that are even these 10, 11, 12 year old kids, they see a sports car and they just assume

73
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
the person's fake.

74
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,760
They assume that they're renting the Lamborghini.

75
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,120
They assume that they're full of crap.

76
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,880
And so you can look at that as a bad thing or a good thing.

77
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,040
I look at it as, as who cares?

78
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,400
I want you guys to be distrusting because if you trust me and just take my word for

79
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,880
it, you're going to trust everybody after me.

80
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,160
So I want you to listen to what I'm saying.

81
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,880
When you get to be in business for a little while, you can tell if somebody's full of

82
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,400
crap or if they've actually been there and done that.

83
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,120
And I want you to like, does, does your gut tell you like, does you feel, does it feel

84
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
natural?

85
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,040
Does it feel like I'm making it up?

86
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,040
And if you don't feel like what I'm saying is true, I don't, I don't want you to be on

87
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
these calls.

88
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,280
I don't, I don't want you to have to pretend or to fake or whatever.

89
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,960
I want you to question everything and every group you are online and every person that

90
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
you hear.

91
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,880
And so I wanted to start by letting you know, I've made millions and millions of dollars

92
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,200
doing the business model of building simple websites and renting them out for passive

93
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
income.

94
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,520
That's why I'm here talking to you guys.

95
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Okay.

96
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
Not because I think I'm smart.

97
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,080
Not because of this, that or whatever, it's because I've actually done it and I'm continuing

98
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
to do it.

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Okay.

100
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,080
So what I want to do, my goal by the end of this call, we're going to do like, I'd say

101
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,920
about 20 to 25 minutes.

102
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,280
I'm going to talk about this passivity.

103
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,520
How passive is this model?

104
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,640
And then we're going to go into some Q&A stuff.

105
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,840
Also throughout this call, if you guys have Q&A that's relevant, I want to answer it as

106
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,040
we go.

107
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,400
I know we're not on a zoom call, but I would like this to be more back and forth.

108
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,280
So don't wait until I'm done to ask your questions, ask them, especially if it's related to what

109
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
I'm talking about.

110
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
Okay.

111
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,560
But again, my goal for this, this episode or it's not really an episode, but this, this

112
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,360
call today is that I want you guys by the end to know exactly how passive this model

113
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,680
is and then you can base your decisions off of that.

114
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Okay.

115
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,680
No BS, no fluff, et cetera.

116
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Okay.

117
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,040
So here's some of the stuff that we're going to cover, guys.

118
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,120
We're going to be talking about how nothing's truly passive.

119
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Just a tiny bit more.

120
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
I've already talked about that.

121
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,560
We're going to talk about where most of the work with this business model comes.

122
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,240
Then we're going to be talking about the most important step of the process.

123
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,880
Then we're going to be talking about different clients and how each client is not created

124
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
equally.

125
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,320
Then I'm going to show you guys and talk to you about some of my most passive websites.

126
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,440
Then I'm going to talk to you about why I believe this is the most passive, what, sorry,

127
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,620
why I believe this is such a passive model, why it's, why it can be that passive.

128
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,440
And then I'm going to give you guys a little bit of bonus at the end and we're going to

129
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
wrap this up and do some Q&A.

130
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
Okay.

131
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,880
So I want to get into it really, really quick, but as usual, I completely forgot to turn

132
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,680
my AC off or on, so give me one second.

133
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,360
It's still like a hundred and freaking something here.

134
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Give me one sec.

135
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Hold on.

136
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,000
All right, guys, let's talk about passive, the passivity of this business model.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay.

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,680
As I already mentioned, nothing is completely passive.

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,680
And by the way, I actually want to ask this question.

140
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,040
If anybody on this call right now, there's 10 of you guys on, if anybody knows of a model

141
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,440
that is completely 100% passive, I would love for you guys to let me know in the comments.

142
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Okay.

143
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,480
Because to my knowledge, there is nothing that is passive, 100%.

144
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Okay.

145
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,120
Does anyone know of any, any business model out there?

146
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,800
TikTok shop, from TikTok shop to whatever, does anyone know of a business model that

147
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
is completely passive?

148
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Matthew Torres, welcome to the call.

149
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm going to wait.

150
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,680
Does anybody know of a business model that is completely passive?

151
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,320
John, John Galenvo, I think.

152
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,520
Sean Sean is also in.

153
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,320
Kurt says just failure.

154
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,280
Yeah, that's passive.

155
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,320
Luke Pritchard, what's on, or what's going on, man?

156
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,720
Luke Pritchard was our winner of our recent scholarship.

157
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,920
Shout out to Luke in Australia.

158
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,680
So guys, as I'm continuing, if you guys can think of anything that's 100% passive, please

159
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
let me know.

160
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,680
But to my knowledge, there's no such thing.

161
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
Okay.

162
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,660
As I mentioned before, there's, there's nothing that's completely passive.

163
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,880
There's varying degrees of passivity.

164
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,120
And on the one hand, there's something, there's things that are not passive at all.

165
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,560
On the other hand, there's things that are very passive.

166
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,320
And we're going to talk about where on the scale this business model actually ends up.

167
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Okay.

168
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,920
For those of you that have never done this, what you need to understand about this business

169
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:06,560
model is that all of the work of this business model is front loaded and it is very, very

170
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
front loaded.

171
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Okay.

172
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,320
It's not like you do a certain amount here and then you do a certain amount in the middle

173
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,960
and then a little bit at the end.

174
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:20,060
It is almost entirely front loaded and it seems like a lot in the beginning.

175
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,140
But if you can get to the point where you can get the client, get the website ranking,

176
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:30,500
get the ads turned down a bit, you can create something that is pretty darn passive.

177
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,860
Jason Allred says nothing is passive.

178
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,060
I don't think so either, but if somebody can correct me, that'd be great.

179
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,060
Okay.

180
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,060
Guys.

181
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,940
The reason why this is such a front loaded business is because, I'm going to say this,

182
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,700
the biggest thing which we're going to, I don't want to jump ahead too much, but the

183
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,460
biggest thing that you got to start with is you got to pick the right city and you got

184
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,460
to pick the right industry.

185
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,700
If you don't pick the right city and the right industry, you're dead in the water.

186
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Okay.

187
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,700
I know some of you guys have been in this long enough.

188
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,900
You're like, yeah, we already know this, but I don't know if you actually understand how

189
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,300
important this is.

190
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,660
What happens is when you first get into this model, you're so anxious to get your first

191
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,660
website up.

192
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,800
You're so anxious to just get going, which I respect and I love, but you go and you go

193
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,180
into the wrong city, you go into the wrong niche and then you're like, I can't get my

194
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,140
website to rank or my website's ranking, it's not producing leads or my website's ranking,

195
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,460
it's producing leads, but I can't find a hungry business owner.

196
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,900
Any one of those options does not equal money.

197
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,300
So guys, you have to know how to do due diligence.

198
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,260
You have to know how to pick a city and how to pick a niche.

199
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:35,220
Some of you guys think that just because you research something and the CPC is below $5,

200
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,100
which for those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm coming, just chill,

201
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,260
that you're just going to go into it.

202
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,340
That's not the case, guys.

203
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:51,420
It took me from 2016 to 2020, mid-2020, before I felt like I had a process for picking a

204
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,660
city and a niche, that was bulletproof and the only reason I was able to develop it is

205
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,540
because I went into so many of the wrong cities and so many of the wrong niches.

206
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,460
I went into 50 different cities in the wrong niche, okay, 50.

207
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,580
I don't know how many times I've been into a city and a niche that looked good and I've

208
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,900
come to find out it's not good, okay.

209
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,980
I've made the mistakes, I've done all those things and that's how I know what the model

210
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,980
is.

211
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,660
So you got to, you know, it's front-loaded because you got to pick the city, you got

212
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,380
to pick the niche, you got to make sure that's perfect.

213
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,660
Then you got to also, you know, let's say you got to land the client.

214
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,740
The way that I teach it is I go, I get a client first, I get the contract, I get the credit

215
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
contract, you got to get the client.

216
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,180
Then once you get the client, you got to build a website and after you build the website,

217
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,220
you got to do the SEO and the content and da-da-da-da-da and then you got to do the

218
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,140
backlinks, you got to get this ranked, you got to keep the client happy.

219
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,780
But guys, once you get to the point where you've built the website, you got the deal,

220
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,020
okay, and these are not in any specific order because you guys know that I get the client

221
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,540
first and then I get the website.

222
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,020
But once you get to the point where you do those things, you have a website, you have

223
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,900
a client and the client has been with you that initial six months, okay?

224
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,780
What I do at that point is I roll them into another contract.

225
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,820
So they're with me six months and then I'm like, hey, does this sound like, is it going

226
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,780
good because for me it looks good, I would like to continue with you, are you going to

227
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,780
continue with me?

228
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,780
Yes, okay, sounds good.

229
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,980
Here's what we're going to do.

230
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,060
We're going to extend this out a year and I'm going to lock in your rate for you.

231
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:21,940
And guys, I'm telling you that if you can just get business owners, keep them happy,

232
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,740
get them to that six month mark and get them into a second contract, even if it's six months,

233
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,340
but I try to get them into a year contract right away.

234
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,100
So then I'm always on yearly contracts, right?

235
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,380
Once you get past that initial contract, if you can get them to sign into another one

236
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,460
and you've done your homework, you've done your SEO, you've done your website, this is

237
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,100
where the business model becomes fun.

238
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,980
This is where the business model becomes very, very passive and this is where everything

239
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,700
opens up and you can start to really scale, okay?

240
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,300
But I'm here to tell you that all the work is going to come in that first six months

241
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,900
and inside of that first six months, 90% of that work is going to come inside the first

242
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,460
month, because that's when you're going to be landing the client, when you're going to

243
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,220
be doing the due diligence, when you're going to be sending the leads, when you're going

244
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,220
to be setting up the website.

245
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,500
And then once you get the website, you start doing the content, then you're just slowly

246
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:12,460
dripping out backlinks or updating this, that, adding a photo, doing a blog, whatever, and

247
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,460
it's not that much.

248
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,020
So in the first six months is all of the work.

249
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,860
All of the work is in the first six months.

250
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,100
Inside of those six months, inside the first month, maybe even say 45 days to be safe,

251
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,020
inside the first 45 days of the first six months is where all the work comes and it

252
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,780
slowly begins to get lighter and lighter and easier and easier, okay?

253
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,700
So you guys need to understand that this business model is frontloaded, okay?

254
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:43,140
Now Scott Gray asked the golden question.

255
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,540
He said, how do you pick the city and niche?

256
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,300
Very carefully, my friend, very carefully.

257
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:56,860
I'm going to give you guys a couple of criteria, but again, guys, that is, there's no way

258
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,580
I could answer that on this call.

259
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,380
Even if we had an hour call dedicated to that question, then there's no way I could even

260
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,380
touch it.

261
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,860
It is something that is an exact process.

262
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,780
That's something that we teach inside Digital Landlords, however, you don't have to be inside

263
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,780
Digital Landlords.

264
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,340
You can go develop your own due diligence.

265
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,220
You can go develop your own system for picking a city and a niche, but it's going to require

266
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,380
you to be willing to fail on a lot of projects, be willing to not rank on a lot of projects.

267
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,740
So a couple of things, though, guys, on the niche.

268
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,100
I'm a big believer, you guys have heard me say this before, go into the boring, tried

269
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,700
and true niches until you get till your bills are paid.

270
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,420
If your bills are 10K a month, you probably need to make about $15,000, $16,000 gross

271
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,740
to net that because you're going to have some ad spend in there if you're going to pre-sell.

272
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,140
So until you get to like $15,000, $16,000 per month gross, I wouldn't even worry about

273
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,140
changing niches.

274
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,580
I would stay in the basic niches, the concrete, the spray foam, the masonry, artificial grass,

275
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,900
the fencing, the, you know, duct cleaning, the gutter installation, the basic tried and

276
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,900
true niches first.

277
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,780
Okay, that's what I'd say in terms of the niches.

278
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,220
Picking a city, I'll give you a couple of tips.

279
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:17,420
Number one, population does not matter, search volume does, growing areas, if you know that

280
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,540
it's a growing area because you've lived there, you have family there, you have some kind

281
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:28,100
of intel, maybe you're a lumber salesman and you like know that the top performing reps

282
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:34,220
are in Bentonville, Arkansas and you're like, oh, that's weird, it must be a huge boom.

283
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,100
That's interesting, you're going to be, there's a lot of population, so that means that most

284
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,940
of the time for these basic services, there's going to be an increase in demand, right,

285
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,060
because the area is growing.

286
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,700
Another thing on city is typically the lower the population, the lower the competition,

287
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,540
but that's not always the case.

288
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,300
What else can I say in terms of city?

289
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,220
I would definitely highly, highly, highly and strongly recommend that whatever city

290
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:04,740
you go into, that the average cost per click is less than $5 and if that doesn't mean anything

291
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,060
to you, it doesn't make any sense at all, you haven't watched enough content, but it

292
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,780
will, those are some of my criteria, but everyone wants to talk about population and this, that,

293
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,500
the rest, oh, the other thing I would mention, try not to go in cities and states that are

294
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
super seasonal, okay?

295
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,940
I try to stay out of North Dakota, I try to stay out of Minnesota, I try to stay out of

296
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:29,980
stuff that's so extreme, Chicago, it's very hot, it's very cold and it's swinging and

297
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,860
all of a sudden you've got these contractors that don't want to work and all this stuff,

298
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,660
that's just some of the things I would recommend without giving you all the secret sauce, okay?

299
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,660
There you go.

300
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,660
Scott, does that answer your question?

301
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:47,180
Okay, we've got another question.

302
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,620
Munib Kashif says one question, if there's no ads running in your niche and also there

303
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,100
are businesses ranked organically, is it a flag not to get in there, especially if you're

304
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
beginning?

305
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,660
If there's ads in your niche and there's also businesses ranked organically, there's always

306
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,660
going to be businesses ranked organically, dog, somebody's got to be ranked organically,

307
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,340
so that's not a red flag for me, if I see businesses ranked organically, then that's

308
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:16,740
just part of Google, somebody has to rank at the top of Google, you know, even if it's

309
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,060
crappy competition, they're still taking your traffic, so I don't worry as much about that

310
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,380
and also if people are running ads, no, that doesn't scare me at all.

311
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,100
If people are running ads, you know what that means?

312
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,580
That means that they've got some hungry business owners that I'm going to go sell to, I'm going

313
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,140
to go sell my service to these hungry business owners, so absolutely not, is that a red flag

314
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,140
in my opinion, okay?

315
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,140
Good question.

316
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,460
If anyone has any more questions, keep dropping the questions, these are good questions, they're

317
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,180
relevant questions, I appreciate them, okay?

318
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,500
Next thing I want to talk about really, really quick, guys, is just to reiterate a little

319
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:56,540
bit more, is if you pick the right city and you pick the right niche, once you are ranked,

320
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,180
this business requires very little work, it's kind of like climbing a mountain, okay?

321
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,340
And what I mean by that, if you guys have ever climbed a mountain, it's like this huge

322
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,140
steep ascension and you get, you're climbing, you're grabbing branches, you're falling down,

323
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,740
you're getting dirty, whatever, whatever, you just claw your way to the top and it's

324
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:20,820
a real pain, and then once you get to the top, to stay at the top is very easy, right?

325
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,860
A lot of times these hills, they're flat at the top, whatever, once you get to the top,

326
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,540
to stay at the top, it's easy, it's very, very easy, right?

327
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,180
It's the climb that's so hard, and so you guys need to understand that even though you've

328
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,420
got all this front-load of work, you've got six months of hard work and probably 45 days

329
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,220
of really hard work in the very beginning, guys, once you get to the top of this mountain,

330
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,020
once you get to that six-month mark, websites ranking, clients in the year two or the second

331
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,580
contract, this business model becomes very, very passive, okay?

332
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,220
And I've got plenty of different examples for you guys that I can share, but I just

333
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,780
want you guys to understand that you've got to remember that picking that right city in

334
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:06,820
that right niche is so vital because it changes the entire freaking game, and if you don't

335
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,620
pick the right city in the right niche, from experience, everything becomes harder, okay?

336
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,780
Now let's talk really quick.

337
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,780
I want to let you guys know that not all clients are created equally, okay?

338
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,540
Not all clients, and the truth is that once you get to the top of Google, you're pretty

339
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,820
well going to stay ranked at the top of Google.

340
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,500
Unless somebody comes in, it's like a really popular city, it's a big city, and you attract

341
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,620
some big competition, most likely you're not going to get overtaken, and even if you do,

342
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,540
you're going to get bumped down one spot, you do a little bit of SEO, you're back up,

343
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,540
okay?

344
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,300
It's not going to be that difficult once you get ranked to stay at the top.

345
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:48,520
However, okay, however, business owners are a different story, yeah?

346
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,660
Business owners are a different story.

347
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,140
You could be at the top of Google, you could be producing the most amount of leads, and

348
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,260
you could have the most high-maintenance business owner on the planet, and that is going to

349
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,020
make this one of the most least passive business models on the planet because of your business

350
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,020
owner, okay?

351
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,020
I've had some of the best business owners that I don't talk to ever, that I literally

352
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:13,420
talk to once every two years, once every three years, and I'm checking on them to see how

353
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,880
their wife did when they went to surgery.

354
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,380
You could also have the business owner that literally thinks that they can text you every

355
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,260
single day and ask you where the leads are if things are slow for one day.

356
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,580
So you guys need to understand, you hear a lot of these older veterans that are in my

357
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,620
program that have been here a while, and they always talk about picking the right business

358
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,620
owner, picking the right business owner.

359
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,540
And a lot of you guys that are brand new, you're so desperate for money, you're going

360
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,700
to go get the first business owner that offers you money, even if they suck, and it's going

361
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,700
to come and bite you in the butt, okay?

362
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,740
And it's going to bite you in the butt because you're going to be dealing with that person

363
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,540
when you could have been dealing with someone that's way less maintenance for the exact

364
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,260
same price, okay?

365
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,660
Also just so you guys know, you've probably seen these memes, you've probably seen these

366
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,540
things or you might have heard of it, maybe you don't believe it, maybe you do, but I

367
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,020
promise you guys the cheaper, the cheapest clients that you have that are paying you

368
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,820
the least amount of money are always the hardest ones to deal with.

369
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,380
I don't know why it is, I don't know what it is, but that is the truth.

370
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,580
The business owners that are the hardest to deal with are the business owners that pay

371
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,580
the least.

372
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:22,460
And I don't know why that correlation is, but I think it's because that small amount

373
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,300
of money means everything to them.

374
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,900
And when you deal with the big companies, when you deal with the successful companies,

375
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,700
they don't care because they're willing to test the file, okay?

376
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,660
So just understand that not all clients are created equally and the degree of passivity

377
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,180
your website is going to have is going to largely depend on the client that you're working

378
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,180
with, okay?

379
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,860
Because that client, if you set expectations from the beginning and the client's low maintenance,

380
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,260
the client's chill, you just have to worry about ranking your website.

381
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,860
Once you rank the website, you're going to be glued to the top for the most part.

382
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,980
And if you have a website glued to the top and a very low maintenance client, you have

383
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:04,500
a freaking, just a gold, a piece of gold sitting in your lap, okay?

384
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
It's the best thing ever.

385
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,420
You have a low maintenance client and you have a website that's ranking.

386
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,940
It's the best business model in the world.

387
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,460
If you have a high maintenance client, oh man, or you didn't do your due diligence properly

388
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,100
and you're just doing SEO backlinks, blah, blah, blah, blah, guys, those become very,

389
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
very, very challenging.

390
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100
Okay.

391
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,700
We have a couple of questions here.

392
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,540
Scott says, how about competition in the search results?

393
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,860
Which lead gen in the top 10, do you try another?

394
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,860
That's such a good question.

395
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,500
I've answered this question a few times.

396
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,100
No, I do not run away if that's what you're asking.

397
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,940
If I see another lead generator in the top 10.

398
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,500
And guys, first and foremost, if you guys are looking at competition, which you better

399
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,540
be looking at competition, because if you don't look at who's ranking for the terms

400
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,100
you want to rank for, you have no idea who you're going against.

401
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,740
If you have no idea who you're going against, you don't know how well you need to prepare,

402
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,500
how dialed in you need to be.

403
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,340
So my first tip for you guys is if you're looking at competition, make sure that you're

404
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,660
using five to seven keywords.

405
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,660
Okay.

406
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,420
Don't just go and type in.

407
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:07,020
Let me see where somebody was living, hold on.

408
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,020
Let's see.

409
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,700
By the way, Luke just asked a question.

410
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,260
He's about to hop out of the car.

411
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,620
Luke, go ahead and ask that question inside the digital landlords so that we can answer

412
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,100
it there since you're going to hop off because I got two more questions that are coming before

413
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
you.

414
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
Okay.

415
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
So ask that.

416
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,100
Great to have you on the stream.

417
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,100
And looks like he's headed to work.

418
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,100
It is what it is.

419
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,860
Okay.

420
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,860
I got to turn this air off again.

421
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,860
Hold on.

422
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:47,620
Dude, I got the laziest AC unit in the entire country.

423
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,860
It's 75 degrees upstairs here in my office and it's October.

424
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,100
Now, granted, I know it's hot outside, but my goodness, the AC just doesn't want to crank.

425
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,940
Maybe we should use my house as a lead.

426
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,620
Too bad that's not my favorite niche.

427
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,620
Okay.

428
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,620
Okay.

429
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,620
Hold on one sec.

430
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,780
Let's see what we got here.

431
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,820
So going back to Scott.

432
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,740
So what I was about to say, guys, is that you need to make sure you're using multiple keywords.

433
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,940
Imagine if I used somebody said they were in Cleveland, Ohio, Kurt Thomas.

434
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:24,220
Then I go into Cleveland and I type in tree service, Cleveland, Ohio, and I look at it

435
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,140
and it looks super competitive, right?

436
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,420
Because it is.

437
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,940
And everyone there is pretty, you know, these websites are juicy websites, lots of content,

438
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,060
old websites, older domains.

439
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,060
You know, I've got a good backlink profile, good, well-written content.

440
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:43,220
And I look at the term tree service, Cleveland, Ohio or concrete, what'd I say?

441
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,220
Tree.

442
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,220
I can't remember.

443
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,220
We'll use tree service.

444
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,820
And it looks super competitive.

445
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,820
And I'm like, yeah, I'm out.

446
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,300
Dude, this looks way competitive.

447
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,980
However, what if I went in and I looked at instead of one term, I looked at seven terms

448
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:03,300
and that term tree service was the most, there was very, very competitive, but tree removal,

449
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,900
tree company, tree cutting, tree service company, tree company near me, tree service company

450
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:13,700
near me, on and on, tree, tree lopping, whatever, if you're in Australia, all of those terms

451
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,700
are wide open.

452
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,300
There's not much competition, right?

453
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,060
That would mean that I've missed out on a huge opportunity.

454
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,660
On the flip side, I've done this before as I go and I look at one term, I look at foundation

455
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,700
repair Savannah, Georgia.

456
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,260
And dude, that term right there looks amazing.

457
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,260
It looks like it's wide open.

458
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,860
It looks like I can go in, I can rank it.

459
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,980
And I'm like, dude, this is a great opportunity.

460
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,940
The CPC on that one term is good.

461
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,780
I go in and I decide to build a project.

462
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,460
I decide to start running ads, but I forgot to look at the other six keywords, the other

463
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,900
five keywords, and I don't even realize it.

464
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,540
And I get in and I'm getting my butt handed to me because I didn't look at all the keywords.

465
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,740
So the answer, the short answer to your question, Scott, is no, I do not care if I see another

466
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,900
lead generator in there.

467
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:04,120
All I do is I view that as another competition, as another business owner that's stealing

468
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
my leads.

469
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,620
And I got to get in there and steal them back.

470
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,620
That's it.

471
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,620
Okay.

472
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,540
Whether it's a lead generator, whether it's home advisor, whether it's the local concrete

473
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,740
tree service guy, they are stealing your spots.

474
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,340
They are taking your leads and they are competition.

475
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,220
But I'm not going to treat a lead generator as any different of competition than just

476
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,580
Joe down the street.

477
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,940
I just need to look at his website.

478
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,660
If his website is very juicy, very highly ranked, high domain authority, high, really

479
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,420
good backlink profile, I might not go into that.

480
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,340
But if it's garbage, then I'm going to pretend I don't even know that's a lead generation

481
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,660
website and I'm going to go into it anyway.

482
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,660
Okay.

483
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
Good comments.

484
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,620
Lars Shepard says, do you have any red flags you look for when you first talk to a B.O.?

485
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,620
Yes.

486
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,140
Number one red flag is they're rude to their clients.

487
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,140
Okay.

488
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,860
This is why I like to live transfer my first few leads, guys.

489
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,780
By the way, we're going to be talking about some of my most passive websites here in just

490
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,780
a second.

491
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,780
Then we're going to get into Q&A.

492
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:05,620
But if I hear them talking poorly to their clients, don't have good customer service,

493
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,580
you know what I can automatically assume

494
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,980
is that they're not going to retain clients.

495
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,700
And they're probably not gonna close deals.

496
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,420
And if they don't close deals and they don't make money

497
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,700
and they don't retain clients,

498
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,620
they're not gonna be with me very long.

499
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,460
They're not gonna have money.

500
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,620
It's not gonna be an ROI.

501
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,780
Even if my leads are good, there's gonna be no ROI

502
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,660
and I'm going to lose that client.

503
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,820
So if I hear you talking to a client poorly,

504
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,420
if I hear you being rude or short

505
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,460
or non-personal with a client,

506
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,780
I already can tell you

507
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,660
that even though they're willing to give me money,

508
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,140
I'm not gonna take it.

509
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,580
Because I'm looking to build relationships

510
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,820
with business owners that want to be with me

511
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,860
for 10, 15, 20 years and make millions of dollars together.

512
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,900
I'm not looking to get a client today,

513
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,900
three months later, switch it out for somebody else.

514
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,980
So if I hear them talking poorly,

515
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,540
that's a huge red flag for me.

516
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,860
Let's see, I'm in the car on the way to work

517
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,340
so I need to balance my interest to know

518
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,260
once you have finally ranked organically,

519
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,540
are you still drip feeding the sites

520
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,140
with backlinks to content or is it okay?

521
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,180
So he's asking guys, once you rank the site organically,

522
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,020
do you keep dripping on backlinks, keep adding content?

523
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,900
And the answer is you can.

524
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,940
What I've done is I've done such strong due diligence

525
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,860
on most of my websites that I do not even worry about it.

526
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,180
I don't even log into my website.

527
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,940
It's kind of like, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

528
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,220
We have websites, we don't even,

529
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,380
I mean, we could find the password,

530
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,380
but we don't know the password.

531
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,180
It's not even part of our regular account.

532
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,380
We've got Towing St. George, my last towing project.

533
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,460
I'm never gonna do it again.

534
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
We don't touch it.

535
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,740
We've got Bentonville Concrete.

536
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,020
No way I'm touching that.

537
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,380
We've got a handful, 10, 15 sites

538
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,060
that are ranking super well,

539
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,860
and there's absolutely no reason for us to go in

540
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,780
and mess with it because we're already ranking.

541
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,260
So that's the approach that I've chosen to take,

542
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,460
but it's up to you guys.

543
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,140
Okay?

544
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,060
Kurt says good stuff.

545
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,460
So guys, here's what I'm gonna do.

546
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,660
Let me see if I can pull up a couple of websites.

547
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,300
Let me see if I can pull up a couple of websites

548
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,140
for you guys.

549
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,980
Here, show you some of my most passive websites.

550
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,700
And we're gonna do, which ones did I wanna do?

551
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,020
We got that one.

552
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,260
All right.

553
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,380
One more, one more.

554
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,420
Let's see which last one we're gonna do.

555
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,260
There it is.

556
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,540
I'm gonna show you guys my screen here, by the way.

557
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,900
Let me get rid of about 100 things here.

558
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,940
All my Slack messages, all my rain music from nighttime.

559
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,340
Do not connect the phone.

560
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,980
Thank you.

561
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,460
All right, guys, here we go.

562
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,740
Let me show you a couple of my most passive websites

563
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,820
on the interwebs today,

564
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,380
and I should tell you guys exactly how passive they are.

565
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,900
Okay, share my screen.

566
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,620
Boom, boom, boom.

567
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,220
Okay, I don't know if you guys can actually see this,

568
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,900
but I'm gonna start off with Bentonville Concrete.

569
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,420
If you guys have heard me talk about this,

570
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,340
kick it out of my face.

571
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,540
So this is us right here, Bentonville Concrete.

572
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,660
We're in the maps.

573
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,980
This is also us, rank number one.

574
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,980
You can also type in Concrete Contractor Bentonville AR.

575
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,500
Rank number two here, rank number one here, okay?

576
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,860
This is my website.

577
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,620
Guys, I'm going to let you know,

578
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,380
the last time I messaged this person

579
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,700
was on about business,

580
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,340
because once in a while we'll talk about random stuff.

581
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,500
Like he just randomly sent me something a couple weeks ago

582
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,580
about some completely random thing.

583
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,980
But the last time he asked about business, guys,

584
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:45,660
was on November 10th,

585
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,540
Friday, November 10th of last year.

586
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,380
He said, hey brother,

587
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,780
I've sent a bunch of emails back and forth.

588
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,580
I'd like to get together and talk and figure out

589
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,460
how I can really expand this business.

590
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,140
I know you guys are good at what you do.

591
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,620
And so are we, I want your help.

592
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,220
Let's figure out how we can do this together.

593
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,980
So the only reason this guy even texts me

594
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,980
is because he was asking me for more business, okay?

595
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,620
This is one of my most passive websites.

596
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,540
It's glued to the top.

597
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,300
We haven't logged into this thing in years.

598
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,540
Haven't changed it in years.

599
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,620
I haven't talked to my business owner since November.

600
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,460
There you have it.

601
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,220
And even then I never even got on a call with him, not yet.

602
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,060
Okay, that's my first one.

603
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,420
My second one is one called St. George Epoxy.

604
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,220
If you type in St. George Epoxy, Epoxy St. George,

605
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,380
it's all called stgeorgeepoxy.com.

606
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,740
Check out this beaut.

607
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,220
This guy right here is an absolute,

608
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,720
just pile of you know what, super basic whatever,

609
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,820
but it works.

610
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,900
And I'm gonna look up the business owner

611
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,420
so I can show you guys, or tell you guys at least.

612
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,980
The last time I got a text from him,

613
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,140
I have three unread messages from him.

614
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,860
March 15th, two messages on March 15th,

615
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,220
and a message on March 16th.

616
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,420
The last thing he said is,

617
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,420
we still need to do your pool deck, LOL, okay?

618
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,980
Homie's still trying to scrape my business, no problem.

619
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,340
Come and give me a quote on it.

620
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,620
I don't really mind, okay?

621
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,880
This website right here,

622
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,660
we also have not logged into in years.

623
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,700
We talked to the business owner.

624
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,420
What did I say the date was?

625
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,580
July, it's been over a year.

626
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,460
That's 2023, it's been a year.

627
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,940
July, August, September, been a year and two months.

628
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,540
Haven't talked to the client, okay?

629
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,660
Let's give you guys one more.

630
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,460
We'll do St. George Concrete, type this in.

631
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,260
You're gonna see us, we are running ads.

632
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,040
She's sponsored here, us.

633
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,460
We're ranked number one underneath the map,

634
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,600
or sorry, the paid.

635
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,620
This is it.

636
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,140
Okay?

637
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,180
I'm sorry, this is, okay, here's a perfect example.

638
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,700
This is not my website.

639
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,540
I'm lying to you.

640
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,940
I think it was Scott who was asking.

641
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,140
So look at this, guys, okay?

642
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,740
We got, this should give you guys

643
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,060
so much freaking excitement.

644
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,000
So we got ConcreteStGeorge.com,

645
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,180
which has been there for a long time, okay?

646
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,380
They're actually outranking me.

647
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,220
I'm StGeorgeConcreteCO.com, okay?

648
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,020
That site looked a little too nice for it to be mine, okay?

649
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,240
This is my site in all of its glory, it's a beaut.

650
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,600
And this website makes me $375 per week.

651
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,060
This client, let me just go ahead and check.

652
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,900
What the hell is his name?

653
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,580
Oh, this is gonna be a problem.

654
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
Is it, shit.

655
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,120
What is his, ah, yes, I just remembered it.

656
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,100
That's what it is.

657
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,440
Yep, okay, November 18th, 2022.

658
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,740
I got one text from November 18th, 2022.

659
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,980
These guys have spent with me.

660
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,620
Let me look.

661
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,060
What the hell?

662
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,100
Okay, not that, not that, not that, not that.

663
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,060
Okay, not that, not that, not that, right there.

664
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,420
Ah, no, that's, is that it?

665
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,780
No, that's not it, dude.

666
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,940
Okay, oh, right there, there it is.

667
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,940
Okay, this client pays me $375 a week,

668
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,620
has paid me, to date,

669
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,380
five, five, oh, sorry, $57,000 on the nose.

670
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,460
Okay, been with me since November 3rd, 2021,

671
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,460
the website you're looking at.

672
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,900
Not ranked number one, not ranking in the maps,

673
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,380
don't even think I have a maps listing.

674
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,860
This thing is churning out leads, $375 a week.

675
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,460
Unfrickin' believable.

676
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,100
This is some of my most passive websites,

677
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,740
and I just grabbed those ones for fun, okay?

678
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,540
Just to give you guys a bit of an idea,

679
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,300
and guys, here's why I think this model is so passive.

680
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,420
I think this model's really passive

681
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,340
because it's such a binary transaction.

682
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,860
I give you leads, you give me money.

683
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,620
You give me money, I give you leads.

684
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,340
If you stop giving me leads, I stop giving you money.

685
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,980
If I stop giving you money, you stop giving me leads.

686
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,260
Done, done, done.

687
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,900
There's no reporting, there's no this,

688
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,260
can you do this stuff, yes?

689
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,700
Do you have to, no.

690
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,940
Okay, no other business model I know

691
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,660
that's such a cut and dry transaction

692
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,220
that's you do this, and I do this,

693
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,340
or else we're done because the arrangement,

694
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,060
there's no room for fluff, right?

695
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,380
When you're doing SEO,

696
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,780
you could do almost nothing for the client.

697
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,060
It took you no time.

698
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,060
Or you could go hire somebody in the Philippines

699
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,660
to do backlinks, do 100 backlinks,

700
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,820
and you come to the business owner and go,

701
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,380
dude, look, I did 100 backlinks for your website,

702
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,540
and by the way, blah, blah, blah,

703
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,860
it doesn't even make sense,

704
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,820
but you're able to show them and craft it

705
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,620
to make it look like you want it to look.

706
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,740
The downside is, with this business model,

707
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,940
you can't fake it, man, and I think that's an upside,

708
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,780
but you can't fake it.

709
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,900
You can't fake work you didn't do

710
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,900
because if leads don't come in,

711
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,060
leads don't come in and they're paying for leads.

712
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,060
That's why I think this business model is so passive.

713
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,340
It's very cut and dry.

714
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,340
It's leads for dollars, okay?

715
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,020
And then lastly, guys, I just wanna let you guys know

716
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,740
that just because you don't have to talk to your clients,

717
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,220
just because you don't have to call them every five minutes,

718
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,180
because you don't have to send them a report,

719
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,860
I want you to picture a business that you have

720
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,380
that you actually do that,

721
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,340
that you actually treat them like they're your last client.

722
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,220
You treat them like they're all of their money

723
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,740
pays all of your bills and then some

724
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,940
because they're that big of a client

725
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,340
and they're all you have to worry about.

726
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,820
Imagine what your business would be like.

727
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,140
Imagine how excited they would be.

728
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,500
Imagine how they would grow with you.

729
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,620
Imagine how many people they would refer you to.

730
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,900
If you just made the decision,

731
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,100
hey, I'm not required to really follow up with this person

732
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,460
or treat them a certain way,

733
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,940
but I'm gonna do it because that's how I do business.

734
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,260
Imagine how many referrals you'd have

735
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,780
be coming down the freaking pipe, a lot, okay?

736
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,620
A lot.

737
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,780
Guys, this model is one of if not the most passive models

738
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,740
on the internet, no questions asked.

739
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,980
And this is the reason I'm able to travel to Dubai

740
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,300
for a month at a time, two times.

741
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,660
We've been in Africa for three months,

742
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,220
been to London twice,

743
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,020
been to a couple of different places in the US,

744
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,260
including Tuscaloosa, Georgia, Alabama game,

745
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,100
getting ready to potentially go to Arkansas

746
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,460
in a week and a half.

747
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,140
Or if not, I might go back to Africa

748
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,500
during that same time.

749
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,780
All of this is possible because this model is passive

750
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
and there's different levels.

751
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,460
Okay, just because you have an online business, that's great.

752
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,300
But if that online business is not passive,

753
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,540
you could travel anywhere you want,

754
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,700
but you're gonna be stuck at the hotel

755
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,660
making sure that business is as usual

756
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,660
or you can't keep living that way.

757
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,140
With this, you can do it, you front load all the work

758
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,540
and then you set it and you forget it, okay?

759
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,900
So guys, that is what I truly believe.

760
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,500
This is how passive these things are.

761
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,420
I will tell you that that website I showed you,

762
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,260
Bentonville Concrete, I don't think we're running any ads.

763
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:25,260
We have a 20 something dollar a year GoDaddy bill.

764
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,860
Cool, we're paying for a tracking number five bucks

765
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,860
and the domain, sorry, the hosting and the domain.

766
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,300
I think that the domain is the thing that's 24 bucks

767
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,540
and then we have the hosting that's like 13 bucks a month.

768
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,180
So guys, all in on less than $50 per month on a website

769
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,340
that's making me about 900 bucks a month.

770
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,160
That's the case for all of these websites.

771
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,860
That's how low cost these things can actually be, okay?

772
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,800
So that said guys, let's see if we have any questions.

773
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,260
If we do, great.

774
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:59,020
If we don't, then we will go back to making money.

775
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,540
Let me just pull this up really quick.

776
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,660
Give me a sec, where you at?

777
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,060
Dog, oh, he's just hiding from me.

778
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,900
Okay.

779
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,260
Ah, where is this at?

780
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,080
And by the way guys,

781
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,300
I really appreciate you guys being on the call.

782
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,060
I know you guys got a lot of places you can be.

783
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,940
I know there's a lot of things you could be doing.

784
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,260
There's a lot of places you could spend your time

785
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,760
and I appreciate you doing it here inside of this group.

786
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,600
I really do.

787
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,900
Okay, so let's see what else we've got going on.

788
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,980
Oh, all right, let's go like this.

789
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,580
How important is it to occupy more real estate

790
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,140
multiple websites on the first page

791
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,940
for our keywords to hold a monopoly?

792
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,420
I don't have any websites

793
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,740
that have more than one piece of real estate.

794
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,700
I've had websites in the past that I ranked the homepage,

795
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,660
I ranked the service page, we had like two,

796
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,180
plus we had the maps.

797
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,780
But guys, most of my deals

798
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,300
are ranking a website organically.

799
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,360
I don't mess with GMB at all really anymore.

800
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,660
I have some paid ads coming in,

801
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,860
I got some organic coming in,

802
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,940
I keep the client happy with that.

803
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,780
Okay.

804
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,140
Kirk says, how important is GMB and how do you acquire it?

805
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,580
No, it's not, I don't do it anymore.

806
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,620
Guys, in 2020, when I scaled up to $100,000

807
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,940
a month in eight months,

808
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,060
half of my websites didn't even have GMB.

809
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,660
We think that they have to have GMB

810
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,780
because we think somehow the clients know about GMB.

811
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,060
The clients don't know shit, dude.

812
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,540
I'm sorry for the language, but they don't know anything.

813
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,220
So don't think that just because you don't have a GMB,

814
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,180
you're not gonna be able to charge $1,500 a month.

815
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,860
Okay, that concrete website I showed you guys,

816
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,680
let me see if I can even try to find, hold on.

817
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,580
Let me see if I can share the screen really quick.

818
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,180
All right, let's see if we can even find,

819
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,300
I don't even think we have a map listing, dude.

820
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,020
This is $1,500 a month deal

821
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,700
that's paid me over $57,000 so far.

822
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,780
And I'm telling you right now,

823
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,460
we do not have a St. George concrete site.

824
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,100
I think we did, I think it got pulled.

825
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,980
So to answer your question,

826
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,920
I don't worry about it at all, okay?

827
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,660
Laura says, do you feel like Flat Fever's commission

828
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,700
is really important to make this pass?

829
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,540
Yes.

830
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,060
No questions asked.

831
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,780
I can't even imagine doing passive income for one deal,

832
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,220
or sorry, passive.

833
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,220
Commission deals for one deal,

834
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,420
much less a bunch of deals.

835
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,380
That sounds like a nightmare.

836
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,100
That sounds like I'd rather pull out my teeth,

837
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,420
pull out my toenails,

838
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,900
do something like that,

839
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,740
rather than put a rat on top of my head

840
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,580
with a woven basket and let it eat down in my skull,

841
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,660
than doing commission, guys.

842
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,580
Commission does not scale.

843
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,660
They have nothing in the game.

844
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,900
They have no reason to go to these leads.

845
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,940
They have no reason to be better than average.

846
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,420
And most of these guys are very, very average or less, okay?

847
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,340
You have to do flat fee if you want to scale.

848
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,180
If you don't want to scale,

849
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,100
you just want a couple bucks coming in here and there.

850
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,260
You can go to everybody to say yes to a commission deal,

851
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,420
but just know upfront that commission deals don't work.

852
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,340
They don't work long-term.

853
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,780
They don't scale and it is very, very cumbersome.

854
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,140
So that said, if you don't want to believe me,

855
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:56,980
then go try it.

856
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,780
Kurt says, RIP GMB.

857
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,060
Yeah, RIP GMB, RIP GMB, but you know what?

858
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,900
It is what it is, man.

859
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,340
We're going to move on to the next thing.

860
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,260
That's what we're going to do.

861
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,300
Okay, guys, I appreciate you jumping on this call.

862
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,420
I'm excited to be back.

863
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,860
I think next week we're going to resume

864
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,220
doing the calls Monday at 6.30 a.m.

865
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,740
So we'll keep an eye out for that post.

866
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,740
It tells you exactly what we're going to be talking about.

867
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,740
And we will send you the link.

868
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,580
Real quick though,

869
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,740
I want to give away a couple of pieces of swag.

870
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,140
I want to give Laura Shepard a piece of swag.

871
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,620
Go ahead and message Aaron and say swag winner.

872
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,060
So he knows he'll send you a coupon code.

873
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,500
I also want to give something to Scott.

874
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,260
Scott Gray, I want you to go

875
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,180
and message swag winner to Aaron.

876
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,300
You guys go ahead and get something from the store

877
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,540
completely on the house.

878
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,140
So you go ahead and enjoy that

879
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,460
and then take a picture and let me see it.

880
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,420
I would love that, okay?

881
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,260
Muneb says, thanks man, really informative.

882
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,620
Absolutely guys, appreciate you guys jumping on the call.

883
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,100
If you have anything else going forward,

884
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,420
we will answer it on the next calls.

885
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,340
And with that said guys,

886
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,380
just remember, I like to say this every time,

887
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,260
money loves speed and I am out.

888
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,100
Talk soon.
