WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Board. Okay, guys, welcome to officially welcome to our call

00:05.680 --> 00:10.080
today. It is the beautiful month of October 29, two days away

00:10.080 --> 00:18.360
from Halloween. We are almost in the second to last month before

00:18.360 --> 00:23.040
this beautiful year ends. For some of you guys, that's a very

00:23.040 --> 00:25.200
exciting thing, because you're gonna love to close the door on

00:25.200 --> 00:28.240
this, this year. And some of you guys have had the year of your

00:28.240 --> 00:32.160
life. And maybe that's not the case. But time is actually

00:32.160 --> 00:35.560
flying. Lots happened this year, a lot of money's been made, a

00:35.560 --> 00:40.120
lot of money's been lost, I'm sure. And here we are. That's

00:40.160 --> 00:45.840
it's actually crazy. Also, I think I might have said this. But

00:45.840 --> 00:51.440
guys, this is just a quick thing I want to say, get creative with

00:51.440 --> 00:53.680
everything you're doing in your business, you need to let people

00:53.680 --> 00:57.120
know what it is that you do. Porter, I told you what we're

00:57.120 --> 01:03.880
doing for Halloween. No. So what we decided to do because one

01:03.880 --> 01:09.520
of my friends, his father in law has this massive, actually an

01:09.520 --> 01:12.880
orthodontist practice. So maybe you could take this to your

01:12.880 --> 01:15.520
wife's family. But it's a great idea. So what they do every

01:15.520 --> 01:17.600
single year on Halloween is instead of giving out candy, they

01:17.600 --> 01:22.680
give out freaking toothbrushes branded with the company. And I

01:22.680 --> 01:25.160
thought I was thought that was genius. Because think about this

01:25.160 --> 01:29.120
500 1000 kids, they're they're dumping their brand in their

01:29.120 --> 01:31.640
home and these toothbrushes are just floating around their house

01:31.640 --> 01:35.120
for the next 365 days. So I was I was like, that's really,

01:35.120 --> 01:37.560
really smart. So this year, because I keep saying I'm going

01:37.560 --> 01:39.600
to do it, I keep saying I'm going to do it. This year, I

01:39.600 --> 01:45.760
went ahead, and I made, like, to well, I don't think it was 650

01:45.760 --> 01:50.400
of these things, I made $2,000 worth of Rubik's cubes, branded

01:50.400 --> 01:53.560
with digital landlords. They're pretty dope, dude, they got the

01:53.560 --> 01:55.880
digital landlord, they got the smiley, and we're gonna be

01:55.880 --> 02:00.720
popping 650 Rubik's cubes into people's homes. And I'm hoping

02:00.720 --> 02:02.800
that moms are going to trip on them. I'm hoping they're going

02:02.800 --> 02:04.840
to end up in minivans. I'm hoping they're going to end up

02:04.840 --> 02:07.680
at schools. And we're going to spread the gospel of rank and

02:07.680 --> 02:10.480
rent. So just as a heads up, guys, you don't need to go spend

02:10.480 --> 02:13.760
two grand, but get creative and think about opportunities. I got

02:13.760 --> 02:17.800
650 little morons coming to my house. Just kidding. They're not

02:17.800 --> 02:20.200
all morons. But a lot of these are pesky little kids. And

02:20.200 --> 02:23.800
instead of giving them a Twix, that's going to just go go and

02:23.800 --> 02:27.000
ruin their teeth, we're giving them a Rubik's cube, which is

02:27.000 --> 02:30.480
going to get their minds sharp. And it's going to get the

02:30.480 --> 02:34.880
branding floating through the southern Utah home. So anyway,

02:34.920 --> 02:36.800
stoked about that. Unfortunately, I'm not going to

02:36.800 --> 02:40.200
be there. So I got my son I'm hiring to pass those out. He's

02:40.200 --> 02:43.000
going to forgive, forego the candy, make a little make a

02:43.000 --> 02:46.040
little cheddar and hand those out since I'm in Dubai. But

02:46.040 --> 02:51.160
guys, use opportunities that you see fit to talk about what

02:51.160 --> 02:53.680
you're doing. Maybe it's a, you know, it's something in your

02:53.680 --> 02:56.040
town, you can put a booth together. I see these all the

02:56.040 --> 02:58.600
time. And I missed them. Like at my son's school, you can do

02:58.600 --> 03:02.960
like a booth and you can give stuff away and whatever. And

03:03.000 --> 03:06.320
they're just good opportunities to, to market your business

03:06.320 --> 03:08.800
because there's a lot of money in your town. I don't even care

03:08.800 --> 03:12.680
like, even where Porter's at, it's a population of like 3000

03:12.680 --> 03:16.200
people or less, there is money in that town. In fact, I have a

03:16.200 --> 03:20.440
client from that town, Mr. Porter. So I think you know who

03:20.440 --> 03:23.320
that is. But anyway, so guys, today, we're gonna be talking

03:23.320 --> 03:27.400
about how to almost get to 10k. Porter, why don't you go ahead

03:27.400 --> 03:33.800
and share the story. And we are going to just get into this. Now,

03:34.000 --> 03:37.920
from what I understand, technically, the deals not 100%

03:37.920 --> 03:41.840
lost Porter sitting at $9400 per month, that is a gross nut

03:41.840 --> 03:46.600
net, just so everybody knows. But he's at $9400 per month,

03:46.600 --> 03:49.800
he's touched, he's almost touched the outer the outer rim

03:49.960 --> 03:53.240
of the 10,000 multiple times, and he keeps falling a bit

03:53.240 --> 03:56.160
short. So we're going to just rub it in a little bit Porter,

03:56.160 --> 03:58.520
tell us what happened, where we're sitting, and what we can

03:58.520 --> 04:01.240
expect from this deal. But

04:02.360 --> 04:06.600
Okay, so I got I got one of this campaign going, it was in

04:06.600 --> 04:09.920
fencing, because I got one in another one in fencing a little

04:09.920 --> 04:12.960
while ago. So hold on, is this, would this be the first fencing

04:12.960 --> 04:13.760
deal you've ever got?

04:14.200 --> 04:16.240
No, this would be my second one.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.880
So you have a client for fencing right now? Beautiful. Okay.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.360
So I was like, I'm just gonna do the same thing. So I go into the

04:22.360 --> 04:27.000
area, and the leads were not as heavily coming in as the first

04:27.000 --> 04:29.920
one. So like, it took me a little bit to send this guy some

04:29.920 --> 04:32.640
lead. But anyways, I called him. And it was the first guy I

04:32.640 --> 04:35.720
called, it was, it was like, hey, someone's actually done

04:35.720 --> 04:38.440
this with me before. And actually, it's someone in the

04:38.440 --> 04:41.440
free group. It's fine. I like looked at his Facebook, and I

04:41.440 --> 04:44.080
figured out who it was. But anyways, I figured out that he

04:44.080 --> 04:45.480
had done this. But anyways,

04:45.520 --> 04:47.200
Oh, tell me his name will kick him out right now.

04:47.720 --> 04:53.520
Yeah. So he was, he didn't even tell me his name. But anyways, I

04:53.520 --> 04:57.120
knew he, I knew who he was. So I started sending him like two to

04:57.120 --> 04:59.440
three leads, whatever. And then I was like, hey, let's get on a

04:59.440 --> 05:03.960
call. So I scheduled out for like the next day. And we get

05:03.960 --> 05:06.400
on the call, I call him and I send him the zoom link, he

05:06.400 --> 05:08.440
watches the screencast. I'm like, hey, get on the computer.

05:08.440 --> 05:12.080
I'm trying to get this thing perfect as I can. Let's set up

05:12.080 --> 05:16.000
like I'm making sure that he watches it. I watched my, my

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
screencast, make sure I included everything. And I sent it to him.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.520
He watches it. And I'm like, sweet, I'm ready to go. And I'm

05:21.520 --> 05:24.360
on my computer. I'm waiting. He called me. And he's like, Hey,

05:24.360 --> 05:26.920
the zoom is not working. I'm like, Oh, my gosh. He's like,

05:26.920 --> 05:29.520
yeah, I like I've been answering. And I'm like, Oh, my

05:29.520 --> 05:32.960
gosh, like, for whatever reason, he couldn't figure out zoom. And

05:32.960 --> 05:35.520
it was a Friday. And I was like, dude, I don't want to get this

05:35.520 --> 05:37.880
half a call. So I just was like, well, let's just do it over the

05:37.880 --> 05:41.040
phone. So this is where I think I messed up was I should have

05:41.040 --> 05:45.120
waited until I got him on zoom. Because this is what happened is

05:45.120 --> 05:51.000
we I did the call, I pitched him at two or 375 per month. And so

05:51.000 --> 05:55.280
1500, which would have put you at 11,000, basically. Yeah. And

05:55.280 --> 05:57.720
so like, it's perfect. So I pitched him at it. And he's like,

05:57.720 --> 05:59.720
okay, that sounds good. I was like, am I supposed to be so

05:59.720 --> 06:02.880
he's like, I think it's a master card. Like, oh, sweet. So I got

06:03.280 --> 06:05.960
Yeah, I got him so I wrote his card number down. And then he's

06:05.960 --> 06:09.060
like, I see the money on the car. Okay. So I'm like, okay,

06:09.060 --> 06:11.980
whatever he's like, it's a car that I use them like, but now I

06:11.980 --> 06:14.780
think about it's credit cards should be able to freaking charge.

06:14.980 --> 06:18.360
Yeah, that was another car, or for he's on it. Yeah. I was like,

06:18.360 --> 06:20.360
you're full crap anyway. But I didn't think about the, oh, I

06:20.360 --> 06:24.960
got his number? Information? Whatever. So a day goes by, and

06:24.960 --> 06:28.180
um, I keep texting like dude. Are you get the cars? Oh, sorry.

06:28.180 --> 06:31.220
I haven't gotten there. And every day, it's like, why send

06:31.220 --> 06:33.980
excuse, excuse. And then finally, it's so hard to get he won't

06:33.980 --> 06:37.340
even answer my call. So I'm like, dude, this guy's dog. And

06:37.340 --> 06:40.700
so I said, I was like, Hey, did you get my because I was like,

06:40.700 --> 06:44.020
maybe I can just have him sign my agreement or my you know, my

06:44.020 --> 06:46.780
credit card authorization so that I can just like sleep at

06:46.780 --> 06:50.140
night, you know, knowing he signed it. So I send that over.

06:50.420 --> 06:52.220
And he's like, you know, I haven't received it. So I sent a

06:52.220 --> 06:54.940
screenshot of the credit card authorization at the bottom. I

06:54.940 --> 06:59.060
said, he will be charged for 375 per month. And he reads it. And

06:59.060 --> 07:05.020
he's like, wait, I thought it was $349 per month. And I was

07:05.020 --> 07:09.820
like, I was like, what? So he literally he thought it was 349

07:09.860 --> 07:14.000
per month. And so the price wasn't right. And it definitely

07:14.000 --> 07:17.940
so he thought it was $1,500 for six months. So I'm like, dude,

07:18.340 --> 07:21.140
what the hell do you mean? That is that is not right. So I

07:21.140 --> 07:23.940
explained to him and he was on the fence about it. And I called

07:23.940 --> 07:26.580
him last night, talked to him. And I was like, dude, like,

07:26.580 --> 07:29.940
where are you at? And he wants to do it. And then at the end of

07:29.940 --> 07:33.220
the day, he's just he's scared to make money scared to, you

07:33.220 --> 07:35.300
know, spend the money. But anyway, I think the deal is

07:35.300 --> 07:37.860
lost. I sent him a breakup text because I was tired of dealing

07:37.860 --> 07:41.100
with him last night. I was like, dude, shit or get off the plot

07:41.100 --> 07:44.060
because I wasted so much time the last couple days. So I just

07:44.060 --> 07:46.620
didn't want to find somebody else.

07:46.860 --> 07:51.980
It's a heartbreaker, bud. It's a heartbreaker. So all right. I'm

07:51.980 --> 07:56.300
curious in the chat, who the heck has had something similar

07:56.300 --> 07:59.220
to that to this happen to them? By the way, Gina Benson,

07:59.220 --> 08:02.620
welcome to call. Good to see on I saw a few more people popping

08:02.620 --> 08:05.700
in. Who has had something similar to this happened to

08:05.700 --> 08:11.060
them in the in their entire career? Maybe they've only been

08:11.060 --> 08:12.700
in the game a little bit and have had to happen. I've had

08:12.700 --> 08:17.300
this happen, by the way, but this is far from uncommon. And

08:17.300 --> 08:20.020
we're going to talk about this today. And yeah, that deal is

08:20.020 --> 08:22.460
toast, but you go ahead and write that puppy off and go get

08:22.460 --> 08:24.740
another one. It's heartbreaking because you don't want to have

08:24.740 --> 08:26.300
to get another one, but you're gonna have to get another one.

08:26.580 --> 08:29.660
And you just chalk it up to a lesson learned. You know what

08:29.660 --> 08:32.580
I'm saying? But we are going to break this down today. But I am

08:32.580 --> 08:37.180
curious in the chat. Has anyone had a similar experience? You

08:37.180 --> 08:39.260
thought you had it? Oh, here we go. Get comments. I didn't even

08:39.260 --> 08:43.900
see. Aaron Vogler says yes, yes, yes. With a triple quadruple

08:43.900 --> 08:47.660
pack. Yes, he has. We got Jared Ochs has had a similar thing

08:47.660 --> 08:50.940
happen twice in the last two weeks. Damn. But Porter, for

08:50.940 --> 08:52.900
real, send me that guy's name. Kick him out of the group, block

08:52.900 --> 08:55.780
him. And I'm going to see if I can get his account completely

08:55.780 --> 09:01.780
span, removed from Facebook. Just kidding. Brandon Shulman.

09:01.820 --> 09:06.900
Absolutely. Okay, so guys, this is a common thing. Porter, you

09:06.900 --> 09:09.420
know, since you're my brother, I'm not gonna say you shouldn't

09:09.420 --> 09:11.660
feel bad because you should, bro. You could have had the

09:11.660 --> 09:16.740
frickin deal, dude. You know, but what it is. So let me start

09:16.740 --> 09:18.780
off by saying this. This happens in any kind of sale

09:18.780 --> 09:20.900
possible. The first time this ever happened to me, I'm not

09:20.900 --> 09:22.900
going to go on story time forever. But you do need to

09:22.900 --> 09:25.220
understand the very first time this ever happened to me in my

09:25.220 --> 09:29.340
entire life. I was in Kearney, Nebraska. Yes, just like you say

09:29.340 --> 09:33.500
Kearney is like when there's the fair, but it's spelled K E A R

09:33.500 --> 09:36.020
N E Y could be an interesting city. Go check it out. It's

09:36.060 --> 09:40.700
it might fit the the pop the the search volume on some of the

09:40.700 --> 09:46.140
niches. Anyway, I mean, Kearney, Nebraska spring break 2013.

09:46.380 --> 09:49.820
Instead of being in Miami trick and chasing women and doing all

09:49.820 --> 09:52.580
that, I had a baby back home wife back home, and I was

09:52.580 --> 09:56.580
knocking doors in the cold. So try that went on for size, but

09:56.580 --> 10:00.100
I'm out in Kearney, Nebraska. And it's a Saturday, and I'm

10:00.100 --> 10:02.660
trying to do my best. I'm trying to make money. It's I'm

10:02.660 --> 10:07.100
frickin drove all the way there. And I, you know, I had a bunch

10:07.100 --> 10:11.380
of deals teed up from Friday to Saturday, come back, come back,

10:11.380 --> 10:13.620
come back, I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm too

10:13.620 --> 10:16.260
young, too stupid to understand that people are full of crap and

10:16.260 --> 10:17.820
they're liars, even though they're humans and they're

10:17.820 --> 10:20.700
adult. So I'm waking up Saturday morning, stoked,

10:20.700 --> 10:22.980
excited, listening to music, thinking I'm gonna have three

10:22.980 --> 10:24.940
deals in the bag by lunch, and I'm going to sail into the

10:24.940 --> 10:28.740
sunset on my way back home. And within about an hour, I realized

10:28.740 --> 10:31.100
I'm gonna have to put on my frickin big boy panties and go

10:31.100 --> 10:34.620
get a deal because all of those deals fell through. First one,

10:34.660 --> 10:39.060
note on the door. Second one, no answer. Third one, don't know

10:39.060 --> 10:41.540
where they're at. All the lights are closed, blinds are closed,

10:41.540 --> 10:43.900
kids peeking through the frickin blinds like don't answer the

10:43.900 --> 10:49.100
door. All of them done. So I'm knocking. I'm scrapping. And

10:49.100 --> 10:51.940
guys, in my mind, I was like, if I have to drive, I don't even

10:51.940 --> 10:54.540
know, it's like 12 hours from Kearney, Nebraska to St. George,

10:54.540 --> 10:58.460
Utah, correction, Cedar City, Utah at the time, I am going to

10:58.460 --> 11:04.900
die of, of, of just mental head heads, just jacked up because

11:04.900 --> 11:07.060
I'm going to I'm going to have to go and think about how I

11:07.060 --> 11:09.820
didn't get a deal on my last day. And I had the whole

11:09.820 --> 11:13.100
Saturday. So I'm literally scrapping to the point where at

11:13.100 --> 11:17.940
lunch, I told them not even to pick me up. I'm like, I have to

11:17.940 --> 11:21.060
get a deal. So my manager came, he brought me like a Gatorade and

11:21.060 --> 11:25.060
like a disgusting protein bar that I didn't eat. And I sat in

11:25.060 --> 11:26.820
the car for five minutes and went knock. So I knock on the

11:26.820 --> 11:30.380
store, guys from South Africa, I do my pitch, I get in the house,

11:30.380 --> 11:34.380
I do the walkthrough. But I started skipping a few steps.

11:34.380 --> 11:37.300
Like I remember, I didn't let him sit down at the table, like

11:37.300 --> 11:39.220
all these little things kind of like Porter's talking about

11:39.220 --> 11:42.300
where, you know, he didn't do the zoom call. Have I closed

11:42.300 --> 11:45.380
deals before not been on a zoom call? Yes. Does it increase my

11:45.380 --> 11:47.940
chances? Yes. But I kind of got a little bit lazy, because I

11:47.940 --> 11:52.060
was so like, I was like Porter, like I had gotten deals almost

11:52.060 --> 11:57.780
every day that week. And I was just so not desperate, but I was

11:57.780 --> 12:00.860
so anxious to get a deal on Saturday, just like Porter so

12:00.860 --> 12:03.620
anxious to finally cross that 10k mark. It's almost like you

12:03.620 --> 12:06.940
have like this bad juju over your head. And I didn't I just

12:06.940 --> 12:09.540
skipped a few steps and I didn't even let him sit down and I was

12:09.540 --> 12:14.220
kind of rushing. Anyway, I pitched the deal. And he's super

12:14.220 --> 12:16.380
interested in the thermostats because you can control them

12:16.380 --> 12:18.700
from the phone. This is before Nest and everything. This is

12:18.700 --> 12:22.300
very, very like high tech to everybody. And the guy's like,

12:22.740 --> 12:26.380
he says to me, he's like, Well, hold on, like we get done. He

12:26.380 --> 12:29.340
says yes, he gives me his information, like the deal is

12:29.340 --> 12:33.340
done. And I'm filling out the card, just to call in and get

12:33.340 --> 12:36.260
this thing set up. And he says to me, he goes, Hey, real quick,

12:36.260 --> 12:40.260
just as a just a heads up. I have, you know, three

12:40.260 --> 12:44.660
thermostats, not two. Will this work? Okay, or he says something

12:44.660 --> 12:46.820
like that, or I've got this other kind of a system. Will

12:46.820 --> 12:51.460
this work? And I hesitated just a tiny bit, because I didn't

12:51.460 --> 12:53.580
want to lie to the guy, but I never heard this question. I was

12:53.580 --> 12:57.300
like, Yeah, it should. There should be no issues. I like,

12:57.460 --> 12:59.900
yeah, I don't think there's any problem. I said, let me just call

12:59.900 --> 13:01.900
my manager really quick. And I'm gonna let me just double

13:01.900 --> 13:04.620
checks. I really didn't want to like, lie to him or whatever.

13:05.100 --> 13:10.620
Anyway, I think I just text my manager and I was like, Hey, can

13:10.620 --> 13:12.380
you do this? And he was also trying to get deals and he

13:12.380 --> 13:15.060
didn't respond. And I was like, Hey, he hasn't responded. But I'm

13:15.060 --> 13:17.820
telling you, if this doesn't work, then we can just lower

13:17.820 --> 13:22.180
your price, whatever. But I'm 90% sure that's gonna work. Well,

13:22.220 --> 13:26.260
90% was not good enough for him. 90% was enough for him to feel

13:26.300 --> 13:30.620
a little bit hesitant, a little bit queasy about the deal. And

13:31.180 --> 13:36.140
from there, I just lost him. And he's like, Well, you know, I

13:36.140 --> 13:38.140
had this meeting, I'm going to go check the meeting out, you

13:38.140 --> 13:41.100
get the answer, come back, meet me, and then we'll do the deal.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.860
But I really want to get that 100% answer. I don't want to

13:42.860 --> 13:47.300
maybe I don't want to whatever. And the so long story short, I

13:47.300 --> 13:51.500
lost the deal. The other crappy part is I found out that yes,

13:51.500 --> 13:55.780
indeed, that I didn't lie, it did do that thing that I that he

13:55.820 --> 14:00.300
did do three thermostats, whatever. And the lesson that I

14:00.300 --> 14:04.180
learned, and it sucked, because I actually left the house, you

14:04.180 --> 14:06.140
know, went and tried to get another deal. And I came back

14:06.140 --> 14:08.660
thinking, Oh, thank goodness, this guy's gonna be home, and

14:08.940 --> 14:11.900
I'm gonna be able to get this deal. And I got back and met

14:11.900 --> 14:14.060
him there telling me, you know what, I thought about it more.

14:14.060 --> 14:16.420
And this isn't something that I need right now, blah, blah,

14:16.420 --> 14:20.540
blah, blah, blah. So basically, the same exact story that you

14:20.540 --> 14:23.380
have, but in alarms, and I've had this happen so many times

14:23.380 --> 14:25.860
to me, we're doing rank and rent that I'm sick and tired of

14:25.860 --> 14:28.660
even thinking about it. So this is something that happens. But

14:28.660 --> 14:32.060
yeah, let's let's break this thing down, guys. Where do you

14:32.060 --> 14:34.540
guys think Porter went wrong? Porter, where do you think you

14:34.540 --> 14:36.940
went wrong? You think you went wrong, not getting on the zoom?

14:36.980 --> 14:40.060
Or where do you think that we lost this deal? Because I'm

14:40.060 --> 14:42.980
telling you right now, I don't think the guy was confused about

14:42.980 --> 14:47.060
375 per week. I think that was just an excuse. I think he

14:47.060 --> 14:49.940
definitely knew what it was. I think that he came back and that

14:49.940 --> 14:52.540
was just him trying to save face based on what you're telling me.

14:52.540 --> 14:55.380
But what do you think you wrote? You went wrong, bud.

14:56.380 --> 14:59.580
I think definitely the zoom call I this is this is what pissed

14:59.580 --> 15:02.180
me off too, though, as he closed one of the deals. So I was like,

15:02.220 --> 15:05.020
bro, and that's why I told him, I said, did you close one of

15:05.020 --> 15:07.700
these jobs? I sent you like, you're telling me like, I don't

15:07.700 --> 15:10.700
see you three. So I didn't think that was a problem. I feel like

15:10.700 --> 15:13.300
I said enough to be the sender screencast. The only thing that

15:13.300 --> 15:16.580
I didn't do was get I get them on the zoom call. And I

15:16.580 --> 15:18.980
obviously I didn't make sure that the deal went through on

15:18.980 --> 15:20.780
the call. You know what I'm saying? Like, I didn't feel like

15:20.780 --> 15:24.060
I actually like got a yes or no. And I should have just said,

15:24.060 --> 15:27.060
hey, if it's a yes, it's either yes or no, it may be is a no.

15:27.340 --> 15:30.220
And I shouldn't have let him freaking get off. I should have

15:30.220 --> 15:31.500
just, you know.

15:33.580 --> 15:35.940
So let me ask you a question. Let's dissect this a little

15:35.940 --> 15:38.500
bit. You said in three leads over the course of how many how

15:38.500 --> 15:41.180
many days weeks? How many leads? Yeah,

15:41.260 --> 15:42.540
it was like one. It was like a week.

15:42.820 --> 15:46.780
Okay, so every week three leads. Did he close? Which one of the

15:46.780 --> 15:48.700
three leads he closed number one, two or three?

15:49.460 --> 15:50.940
Number three, the third one,

15:51.380 --> 15:53.460
the third one. And that's when you decided to go for that's

15:53.460 --> 15:55.460
that's textbook. Good job, by the way, because you don't need

15:55.460 --> 15:57.780
to send him five if he closed number three. So you did all

15:57.780 --> 16:03.540
that correctly. You sent him the screencast did. Yeah, the only

16:03.540 --> 16:06.780
thing guys, remember that when you lose a deal when you lose a

16:06.780 --> 16:11.540
sale, most of the time, it's the step previous. So you think, oh,

16:11.740 --> 16:14.420
you know, I didn't do a good job in the presentation. And that's

16:14.420 --> 16:18.500
why I lost the deal. But really, it's typically something if you

16:18.500 --> 16:20.780
lost the deal there, it's probably something in the

16:20.780 --> 16:24.260
previous step, which is the setup. And I mean, I think

16:24.260 --> 16:26.060
there's two things that could have happened. I think number

16:26.060 --> 16:31.060
one is, you know, guys, I ran calls trying to close deals on

16:31.060 --> 16:35.500
the phone for four years. I isn't it's crazy. Porter, did

16:35.500 --> 16:39.460
you know that I didn't start doing zoom closes until 2020?

16:40.580 --> 16:43.420
I did not. It's so hard. I was getting so frustrated.

16:43.700 --> 16:48.140
Now there. Let me say this. I when I say I didn't I didn't

16:48.980 --> 16:52.820
do them like consistently once in a while I would but it was a

16:52.820 --> 16:54.980
little bit more comfortable for me because I felt a little bit

16:54.980 --> 16:58.300
like nervous having to sit in front of a screen and talk to a

16:58.300 --> 17:00.940
human even though it was a computer screen. So I was the

17:00.940 --> 17:03.740
one that was opting usually for the phone call I'd get my card

17:03.740 --> 17:06.460
is kind of like a de stress or I could talk and whatever. But

17:06.500 --> 17:10.180
guys, I for the first first four years of my rank and rank

17:10.180 --> 17:13.740
career, I did not use zoom. And then the only reason I started

17:13.740 --> 17:16.700
using zoom is because it was COVID and everyone is talking

17:16.700 --> 17:18.700
about zoom. And there was like all these memes on zoom and

17:18.700 --> 17:21.780
people doing weird stuff during classes and calls and stuff. And

17:21.780 --> 17:24.740
I was like, and everyone was like zoom, zoom, zoom. So I was

17:24.740 --> 17:26.780
like, Okay, I'm gonna start using it. And then I just shot

17:26.780 --> 17:29.380
through the roof. And I was like, I'm an idiot. Because it's

17:29.380 --> 17:32.540
just like being in person to the point that even if I was closing

17:32.540 --> 17:35.340
somebody in Dubai, and they want to go to dinner, I would choose

17:35.340 --> 17:37.660
to do is I go to dinner, I choose to do to do a zoom call

17:37.660 --> 17:40.020
to close the deal because I can show them things. People are

17:40.020 --> 17:43.220
serious when they're at their desk at their computer. But

17:43.220 --> 17:46.060
that's number one, guys, always, always, always, always, always

17:46.580 --> 17:50.660
get on a zoom call. Now, I'm at the same time, because this is

17:50.660 --> 17:55.340
an art not a science. You know, sometimes you you try so hard to

17:55.340 --> 18:00.300
get on a zoom call that you miss the deal, you miss the energy

18:00.300 --> 18:05.100
and whatever. And so I will say there are times when conditions

18:05.100 --> 18:09.100
can't be perfect. But dude, I would rather even someone be on

18:09.100 --> 18:12.020
a zoom call in a gas station parking lot on their phone,

18:12.180 --> 18:14.420
than be on a phone call, because you ended up running a phone

18:14.420 --> 18:19.820
call, correct? Yeah. Yeah. So that I would say that's number

18:19.820 --> 18:21.860
one. And then the second thing, and it's something I want to

18:21.860 --> 18:24.300
talk about really quick, too. And by the way, Brandon said,

18:24.300 --> 18:26.860
well, let's look at our comments here. Aaron said, Yeah, hopping

18:26.860 --> 18:29.180
on a zoom, probably would have built more trust seems like that

18:29.180 --> 18:32.020
was the issue. I agree with you, Aaron. And that is one of the

18:32.020 --> 18:35.700
things, I would say the hardest thing here, sending the leads

18:35.740 --> 18:38.060
does help build trust. But when people can see you, they can see

18:38.060 --> 18:40.340
this is a real person. And if they have my credit card,

18:40.420 --> 18:43.620
they're actually not going to like scam me. That helps a lot. I

18:43.620 --> 18:45.620
agree. And then Brandon says, what if you would have

18:45.620 --> 18:49.500
compromised said, let's do it for 349 per week for a month or

18:49.500 --> 18:52.740
two, and then it will go to 375. So Brandon, just a little

18:53.780 --> 18:57.660
clarification. The guy's claiming that he thought it was

18:57.660 --> 19:02.940
$349 per month, instead of per week. So it's not a discrepancy

19:02.940 --> 19:08.460
of 15 or $25. It does discrepancy of 1200 $1,100 of

19:08.460 --> 19:11.220
difference per month. So the guy's basically, in my mind,

19:11.300 --> 19:15.460
full of crap. And saying that he thought it was something else

19:15.460 --> 19:17.500
when I think that's bullcrap. What do you think, Porter?

19:18.180 --> 19:20.700
No, now, after I'm done with this, everything that I'm

19:20.700 --> 19:23.420
thinking about, I'm like, that's so dumb. Like, I showed you the

19:23.420 --> 19:25.780
screencast, like everything that I was pointing at, like, I

19:25.780 --> 19:28.660
didn't drop the price. But during the call, I clearly said,

19:28.660 --> 19:32.460
Hey, $1,500 per month, like, I was not hesitant about that. I'm

19:32.460 --> 19:35.300
like, you, you're, you're, you're full of crap.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.940
Yeah, you can't I mean, it's it did he ever sign the contract?

19:40.220 --> 19:44.300
No. Okay. So yeah, he definitely knew. Here's the other thing

19:44.300 --> 19:46.220
guys. And this is another really, really important thing

19:46.220 --> 19:48.700
is I have a live Aaron, if you're still on this call, I

19:48.700 --> 19:51.740
would love for you to pull this up. And maybe we can reference

19:51.740 --> 19:55.060
it in the comments. But there's a live we have it's called drill

19:55.060 --> 20:00.020
the hole. And there it is so important that you guys getting

20:00.020 --> 20:03.060
a credit card. unbelievably important. You did a great job

20:03.060 --> 20:04.660
because a lot of people say, Hey, call me and I'll give you

20:04.660 --> 20:08.220
my credit card digits. And that's great. But running the

20:08.220 --> 20:14.500
credit card is the key. Okay. And so I have this live, I don't

20:14.500 --> 20:17.180
want to like spoil it. But basically, there was something I

20:17.180 --> 20:18.980
used to do in door to door sales, a lot of the stuff that

20:18.980 --> 20:21.980
I that I learned, that's like the fundamental stuff about

20:21.980 --> 20:24.820
sales, I learned from door to door sales, but it's exactly

20:24.820 --> 20:27.980
the same here. And what I would find guys is that when I got a

20:27.980 --> 20:30.380
deal, I'd close somebody on getting an alarm that was going

20:30.380 --> 20:32.980
to be in their house for the next however many years, five

20:32.980 --> 20:35.980
year contract, I would get the credit, I'd get the credit card,

20:35.980 --> 20:39.140
I'd get the check, I would get the contract signed everything

20:39.180 --> 20:43.340
right, just like Porter did. But sometimes like we would always

20:43.340 --> 20:46.940
try to schedule by the way, we would always try to schedule to

20:46.940 --> 20:49.420
get these things scheduled right away. So if I close you today,

20:49.820 --> 20:52.580
like right now, I would have it scheduled tonight, because I

20:52.580 --> 20:55.020
knew that if I didn't, there was a good chance that you were

20:55.020 --> 20:57.380
going to cancel. Okay, that's just what happened because you

20:57.380 --> 21:00.620
start thinking about it. And it was emotional sale. Oh, man, five

21:00.660 --> 21:04.660
50 bucks a month or whatever that's $600 a year, or more, we

21:04.660 --> 21:08.220
could do something else that but then what I started realizing

21:08.220 --> 21:12.340
is that if I could just get some of the equipment in the house,

21:12.340 --> 21:16.220
even one piece of equipment and charge their card charge their

21:16.220 --> 21:20.460
bank account for that initial deposit, even if it was $100, I

21:20.460 --> 21:24.900
almost never lost any deals, I swear to you, and my technicians

21:24.900 --> 21:26.820
would get really pissed off because they wanted to get to

21:26.820 --> 21:29.060
the house, install the whole thing and not have to come back.

21:29.060 --> 21:31.500
So I'd have to text the technicians and be like, yo, this

21:31.500 --> 21:34.020
lady is not going to be cool with you staying in her house

21:34.020 --> 21:37.340
till midnight. She's a single lady. And you look pretty scary

21:37.340 --> 21:40.940
and you haven't showered in like a year. But I'm going to pay

21:40.940 --> 21:44.980
you whatever 100 bucks or not probably 20 bucks that time

21:44.980 --> 21:48.380
said it wasn't making 100 bucks to throw around. I'll pay you

21:48.380 --> 21:51.780
20 bucks, come in, drill a hole in the wall, slap up the panel

21:52.140 --> 21:55.500
and come back tomorrow, I'll pay you extra for your time spent.

21:55.660 --> 21:59.460
And just because guys, it was crazy the amount because then

21:59.460 --> 22:02.060
guess what it was real to them. They could see it on the wall.

22:02.100 --> 22:04.740
And most importantly, we had charged the card and the damage

22:04.740 --> 22:07.180
was done. There was no going back even though it was possible

22:07.300 --> 22:10.620
to get their money back. It was so much harder. So what I highly,

22:10.620 --> 22:12.460
highly, highly, highly recommend by the way, Aaron just

22:12.460 --> 22:15.220
referenced it, that is a phenomenal live and it is very

22:15.220 --> 22:20.740
true. And we do this the same with anything that we sell, we

22:20.780 --> 22:25.500
sell is get a payment, send the guy an invoice, say, Hey,

22:25.500 --> 22:27.340
Porter, what I would have done, hey, I'm gonna send you an

22:27.340 --> 22:29.260
invoice, you can put the money on later, but I got to get at

22:29.260 --> 22:33.180
least like $100 down payment, non refundable. And I'm going to

22:33.180 --> 22:35.580
send it to you real quick. And then I'll charge the rest of it,

22:35.620 --> 22:38.700
you know, let's say in 24 hours, but I'm going to charge 100

22:38.700 --> 22:41.220
bucks. So hang on one second. I promise you if you would have

22:41.220 --> 22:44.060
charged even 100 bucks, there would have been an 80. I'm just

22:44.060 --> 22:47.340
throwing numbers out here. But maybe, you know, 80% chance he

22:47.340 --> 22:49.380
would not have went sideways on you.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.220
No, it pisses me off so bad because I was like this thoughts

22:54.220 --> 22:54.980
and you said yes.

22:56.380 --> 22:58.940
Yeah, and that's the frustrating part. And I you know,

22:58.940 --> 23:01.220
Francesca's lost deals like this, Kyle's lost deals like

23:01.220 --> 23:03.900
this, I've lost deals like this. And I'm hoping that people on

23:03.900 --> 23:06.020
this call are not going to lose deals like this guys, if you get

23:06.020 --> 23:12.300
the deal, make sure you frickin run the deal on the call. Okay,

23:12.340 --> 23:14.900
and good. Look, I understand the situations people are lying.

23:14.900 --> 23:17.140
We've had the craziest stuff happen. We've had people giving

23:17.140 --> 23:19.460
the credit card, and they're reading all the digits and they

23:19.460 --> 23:23.060
get to the last four and they cut the zoom and they pretend

23:23.060 --> 23:24.980
that their phone died and you never hear from them again.

23:27.540 --> 23:32.140
We had a guy just barely this is so amazing. We had a guy in

23:32.140 --> 23:36.340
the last couple weeks, about a month ago, get done, we figure

23:36.340 --> 23:38.780
it out, put a deal together. He's pumped. This guy has been

23:38.780 --> 23:43.420
hitting me up for years about doing this. And anyway, long

23:43.420 --> 23:47.980
story short, he gets the credit card information to us. And he

23:47.980 --> 23:51.260
tells Kyle, he's like, Yeah, I'm sorry, he doesn't give the

23:51.260 --> 23:55.380
credit card information. He's a yes, he's I'm good. He's a

23:55.380 --> 23:58.340
whatever. And then you know what he says? He says, I lost my

23:58.340 --> 24:03.220
wallet. Let me I'm gonna have to find it. And then I'll let you

24:03.220 --> 24:05.620
know. It's like, bro, no one lost their wallet. And I don't

24:05.620 --> 24:08.180
know about you. But I have like 15 cards saved on my computer.

24:08.260 --> 24:10.700
And I know my card. And I've got a picture of my card, and all

24:10.700 --> 24:15.340
this different stuff. And dude, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle took the bait,

24:15.340 --> 24:19.500
dude. Kyle took the bait called me got the deal. We got the

24:19.500 --> 24:22.460
deal. Didn't run the deal. I was like, yeah, things done, dude.

24:23.180 --> 24:25.580
Guess what, dude still hasn't done it.

24:26.820 --> 24:27.620
In two weeks.

24:28.060 --> 24:31.180
Oh, it's been like a month. And then we finally got a text back.

24:31.340 --> 24:33.900
We started giving him a hard time. We're like, Hey, bro, are

24:33.900 --> 24:39.300
you like, you know, not sure that you can make this work? Or

24:39.300 --> 24:41.660
are you? Do we need to talk to your wife? Like, it's somebody

24:41.660 --> 24:44.300
that's like pretty chill. We're giving him a hard time. And that

24:44.300 --> 24:48.220
was like, finally, like, oh, sorry, been busy. We had a baby

24:48.220 --> 24:50.340
and I can't make any decisions to after the baby. And it's

24:50.340 --> 24:53.380
like, bro, you already said yes, you said you lost your wallet.

24:55.220 --> 24:58.380
So point is, guys, I don't care if these by the way, Richard

24:58.380 --> 25:01.060
Marches, welcome to the call, my friend, it doesn't matter how

25:01.060 --> 25:03.980
old people are doesn't matter if they're men, women, doctors,

25:03.980 --> 25:07.100
lawyers, frickin, whatever people are full of schnazzle.

25:07.260 --> 25:09.300
And they will lie straight through their teeth while

25:09.300 --> 25:13.380
looking you in the eyes and eating frickin, whatever. That's

25:13.380 --> 25:17.340
just how people are. Do not leave the call. First of all,

25:17.420 --> 25:21.420
always get on a zoom call every single time. Let's talk about

25:21.420 --> 25:24.420
that really good Porter. I couldn't get on the zoom call you

25:24.420 --> 25:26.660
said because he had an Android. Is that a thing? Because he

25:26.660 --> 25:27.180
should know.

25:29.220 --> 25:31.620
I think I was that was complete bull crap. I think he didn't want

25:31.620 --> 25:34.180
to get on the zoom call because he was he was out on a job. I

25:34.180 --> 25:36.620
told him I said, Hey, I need a computer. That was his first

25:36.620 --> 25:39.620
thing I told him I said be on a computer. He was that was this

25:39.620 --> 25:43.020
one thing. And then zoom I called him I was like, we're like,

25:43.020 --> 25:45.140
are you home? He's like, no, I'm out on a job. I'm like, okay,

25:45.140 --> 25:49.300
well, that sucks. Like, so now he's in his truck. And then the

25:49.300 --> 25:51.940
zoom call, which I think you can join zoom, just join in your

25:51.940 --> 25:54.460
browser. So I'm like, I don't think he just wanted to get on

25:54.460 --> 25:56.540
zoom. He was just making that excuse.

25:57.100 --> 26:01.140
100%. So here's the thing, guys, is if I'm doing a call, and I've

26:01.140 --> 26:04.900
tried to get this deal, and the guy closed a job, and I'm like,

26:04.900 --> 26:08.500
hey, look, this guy's hot, let me get on it, whatever. And I, I

26:08.500 --> 26:12.380
could see and I could I could justify like, all right, you

26:12.380 --> 26:16.340
know, perfect scenario, he's at a computer, and he's on zoom. I

26:16.340 --> 26:20.900
could justify though, getting on a zoom on your phone on the job

26:20.900 --> 26:23.060
site, I'd say, hey, can you go in your truck? Let's talk like

26:23.060 --> 26:26.460
that's still not ideal. But it's it's it works. And I've closed

26:26.460 --> 26:30.300
deals like that. But I would rather wait, I would I would

26:30.300 --> 26:34.020
literally tell the guy maybe on the spot, something like, hey, I

26:34.060 --> 26:36.300
you know, no disrespect here. I've sent you three leads, you

26:36.300 --> 26:38.740
already made money. You said you'd be on a zoom call, I need

26:38.740 --> 26:43.180
you to be on a zoom so I can show this to you. Can I like, if

26:43.180 --> 26:45.660
it's not that I need you to be by computer in the next couple

26:45.660 --> 26:51.380
hours, I probably would never get on a call call on without

26:51.380 --> 26:54.940
being in zoom, unless maybe I had tried two, three times. And

26:54.940 --> 26:58.100
I was like, at this point, I'm just losing that momentum, that

26:58.100 --> 27:01.260
steam that energy that whatever, that's when I might justify

27:01.260 --> 27:06.260
that. But I would say it's, it's, you could justify getting

27:06.260 --> 27:09.380
on a zoom on the phone, but definitely make sure you get on

27:09.420 --> 27:12.540
a zoom, even if it's a gas station parking lot on a on a

27:12.540 --> 27:15.900
job site zoom for sure, because it's just hard. Like if, you

27:15.900 --> 27:18.860
know, people, it's, again, when we go back to door to door

27:18.860 --> 27:22.100
sales, guys, there's these little things that the more of

27:22.140 --> 27:25.220
it's, it's like the training, right? Sales is like baking a

27:25.220 --> 27:27.940
cake, we have the perfect recipe, we're telling you exactly

27:27.940 --> 27:30.660
when to put in the flour, when to bake, when to, you know, stir

27:30.660 --> 27:33.300
the eggs, when to add this, how much butter, what brand of

27:33.300 --> 27:36.660
butter, whatever. And, you know, you guys can, you know,

27:36.660 --> 27:39.300
you have to do it perfectly. And you might still have a cake

27:39.300 --> 27:43.180
that's that works, right? But the less of the of the

27:43.180 --> 27:46.940
recommendations, the more you deviate from the exact recipe,

27:47.260 --> 27:51.060
the more variables there are, and the more chance you have of

27:51.060 --> 27:54.340
losing the deal of the cake coming out tasting like garbage,

27:54.380 --> 27:58.420
right? So you do what you can, you know, once in a while, you're

27:58.420 --> 28:00.540
like, all right, ideally, you're supposed to use this kind of

28:00.540 --> 28:03.900
butter. But today, we only have this kind of butter. It's not

28:03.900 --> 28:05.980
perfect. But you know what, we need the cake because it's

28:05.980 --> 28:08.620
somebody's birthday, I'm going to slam it in. That's a good

28:08.660 --> 28:12.140
that's something that you could look past. Something like not

28:12.140 --> 28:15.900
getting on a zoom call. That's like, you know, using baking

28:15.900 --> 28:20.460
powder instead of flour. Like that's tough, right? And yes,

28:20.460 --> 28:23.580
maybe once in a while, you're going to squeak out a deal. But

28:23.580 --> 28:25.180
I'm telling you guys right now, we're gonna we're talking about

28:25.180 --> 28:28.660
this, because it's just for everybody to not lose this, make

28:28.660 --> 28:33.300
sure you guys get on a zoom call every single freaking time,

28:33.300 --> 28:35.980
even if it's in a gas station parking lot, even if it's on a

28:35.980 --> 28:38.460
job site, and just tell the business owner, especially

28:38.460 --> 28:44.100
Porter, you had enough leverage because he you'd you'd send him

28:44.100 --> 28:46.820
three leads and he closed one you had made him money without

28:46.820 --> 28:49.500
anything in return. So I think it would have been completely

28:49.500 --> 28:51.300
fine for you to say like, look, dude, you told me to be on a

28:51.300 --> 28:54.940
call. I need you to like get to a truck and get on a zoom you

28:54.980 --> 28:58.100
sir, you have to push a link. I've done this 100 times. I don't

28:58.100 --> 28:59.740
care if you have an iPad, you just push the link and it's

28:59.740 --> 29:03.580
gonna put you on pretty simple. My grandpa does. Yeah, you can

29:03.580 --> 29:09.140
joke about it. But get on a zoom. Yeah. Okay, so it's okay,

29:09.140 --> 29:14.140
bro. Um, nothing like losing nothing like losing a $18,000 a

29:14.140 --> 29:17.140
year, but could have been pretty nice to when you think about

29:17.140 --> 29:22.900
it like that. It makes you sick, right? Yeah. Dude, I I've been

29:22.900 --> 29:25.860
to the very, very end of deals and been like, I literally did

29:25.860 --> 29:29.020
all this work. It's been it's been weeks of work. And I just

29:29.020 --> 29:32.420
lost at the very end because I was lazy or because I said this

29:32.420 --> 29:36.580
or because I did that. And it's frustrating. Okay. So Trevor

29:36.580 --> 29:39.620
time says not being able to get a zoom call from an Android is

29:39.620 --> 29:43.140
100% BS. Yes, that is absolutely true. Because guys, all you have

29:43.140 --> 29:45.500
to do is click on it. Yes, we know that I enjoy is our

29:45.500 --> 29:49.180
inferior. Just kidding to you Android users. To be honest, I

29:49.180 --> 29:53.220
just think that Apple's got me by the teeth. But you can just

29:53.220 --> 29:56.140
click on a link. And Aaron says, Yeah, someone needs to tell zoom

29:56.140 --> 30:00.060
to get compatible with Android lol. Okay, Corey says, Are there

30:00.060 --> 30:03.020
any live recordings of zoom calls with past customers that

30:03.020 --> 30:08.340
we can? Yes, there are. Corey Gilbert. Yes, there are. Maybe

30:08.340 --> 30:12.180
Aaron, you could tag him in a few. We have a few live calls

30:12.180 --> 30:16.060
that I've done. These are some of the OG calls from 2020. You're

30:16.060 --> 30:18.540
going to see that my process isn't perfect. I'm still

30:18.540 --> 30:22.740
learning. But you definitely can see that I'm a young buck, just

30:22.740 --> 30:26.020
trying to make a name for himself back in the the on the

30:26.020 --> 30:29.300
interwebs. Gina Benson says, What do you think about recording

30:29.300 --> 30:31.380
a video to send to the business owner before getting on the

30:31.380 --> 30:39.900
zoom? Yeah, I do that. I don't know. Maybe Gina's talking

30:39.900 --> 30:42.420
about said like having one video that you can send that could be

30:42.420 --> 30:47.380
a good idea. That's a really good idea. And I'm guessing

30:47.380 --> 30:50.300
part of you said in the zoom that like kind of explained what

30:50.340 --> 30:54.620
the expectations were before, right? Yeah, screencast. Sorry.

30:56.700 --> 30:58.100
What do you think about recording a video to send the

30:58.100 --> 31:00.980
business owner before getting on the zoom? Yeah. So yeah, I'm not

31:00.980 --> 31:03.700
really sure you're saying Gina, but if you're saying because

31:03.780 --> 31:08.940
that is actually a really good idea. I like to do with lead

31:08.940 --> 31:13.180
generation deals, I really like to have, I'll take the time to

31:13.180 --> 31:19.220
manually create a custom video, a custom screen recording a

31:19.220 --> 31:22.460
custom screencast for each one, because then I can say their

31:22.460 --> 31:24.900
name again, and again, and again, I can show their website,

31:24.900 --> 31:27.740
it's very custom, and it's 10 minutes long, five minutes long.

31:28.460 --> 31:31.420
However, with those of you, all of you that are on this call

31:31.420 --> 31:34.340
that joined digital landlords, we do the same thing, we have a

31:34.340 --> 31:36.500
call that kind of sets expectations. It's funny, we do

31:36.500 --> 31:41.140
the exact same process that we teach with you guys, when you

31:41.140 --> 31:43.660
join this program, right, we send you a screencast, it's not

31:44.260 --> 31:46.420
exactly customized for every single person. But that

31:46.420 --> 31:49.820
screencast says, here's the expectations. You know, when you

31:49.820 --> 31:52.060
get to the end, don't don't tell us you need to do this, this,

31:52.060 --> 31:54.300
this or this, like, we are expecting you to give us a yes

31:54.300 --> 31:57.180
or no, if it's a maybe it's a no. And we're going to get on and

31:57.180 --> 31:59.140
show you this, this and this. And we're going to ask you to

31:59.140 --> 32:02.380
make a decision, like, we do the exact same thing. So that's a

32:02.380 --> 32:09.900
good idea. Let's see, Gina says, yeah, like custom for each

32:09.900 --> 32:13.540
one. Yeah, that's, that's what I that's what I do. That's exactly

32:13.540 --> 32:18.020
what I do. Aaron says, Andy, the you can't sell an Android

32:18.020 --> 32:22.140
user truth lives on. It is a little more difficult. I sold

32:22.140 --> 32:26.340
Android users, but I know what you're saying, bro. Okay, Aaron

32:26.340 --> 32:28.860
says to Corey, he's gonna message a few screencasts Nick

32:28.860 --> 32:31.540
has done for real profit. Also, Corey, if you want, like, I'm

32:31.540 --> 32:34.980
going to check this out. Like if I, if you go to, if you just go

32:34.980 --> 32:39.100
to the Facebook group, I'm going to see what the smart search

32:39.100 --> 32:41.060
I'm just I have no idea how I'm even going to find it. I'm going

32:41.060 --> 32:42.940
to go to the Facebook group, I'm going to go to the little

32:42.940 --> 32:50.980
search bar and put live recording. Hold on. Maybe live

32:50.980 --> 32:54.140
sales call. Okay, there's Yeah, right there. Okay, that's let's

32:54.140 --> 33:00.180
see. Hold on. There we go. I got one right there. Oh, that's a

33:00.180 --> 33:02.580
discovery call. Just kidding. But yeah, another thing that you

33:02.580 --> 33:05.940
guys can do it, Corey is you can just do some smart searches might

33:05.940 --> 33:09.820
take you a second. But if you don't want to wait for anyone,

33:09.820 --> 33:13.460
look, there's another one right there. Borhan, one of our

33:13.460 --> 33:16.980
students actually posted his deal. There's a bunch of them

33:16.980 --> 33:21.180
just type in smart searches, live recording, live call. I'm

33:21.180 --> 33:25.500
going to I bet you type if you type in live close, like this

33:25.500 --> 33:31.220
live close Nick would inside of the group search bar. There we

33:31.220 --> 33:33.820
go. Boom, found one right there. There's a there's a deal that I

33:33.820 --> 33:38.260
lost right there on December 7 2022. If you want to see that

33:38.260 --> 33:43.420
one, there is let's see, I bet I can find another one quickly.

33:43.420 --> 33:47.820
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold tight. See if I can find

33:47.820 --> 33:50.020
another one. There's a picture of Kanye in a boat. You guys

33:50.020 --> 33:54.060
know what I'm saying? That's great. Let's see. Oh, right

33:54.060 --> 33:59.420
there. There's another one. Yeah, anyway, that's just another

33:59.420 --> 34:04.740
idea, guys. Video two of to build your list. Just go do a

34:04.740 --> 34:06.460
couple smart searches. But Aaron, yeah, that would be cool

34:06.460 --> 34:10.260
if you could if you could help him out as well just to kind of

34:10.260 --> 34:13.580
speed things up. Okay. I'm just gonna see if there's one more.

34:13.860 --> 34:15.940
Dude, I by the way, guys, for those of you that have been in

34:15.940 --> 34:19.580
this group. Oh, here we go. I'm gonna here's a $1,200 a month

34:19.580 --> 34:22.460
flat fee close. Corey, I'm gonna tag you in this one right now

34:22.460 --> 34:25.780
just to save Aaron some time. But just guys. Yeah, that's one

34:25.780 --> 34:28.020
thing to know in this group. That's the beautiful thing about

34:28.020 --> 34:31.100
Facebook groups, even though I freaking hate Facebook sometimes

34:31.420 --> 34:36.060
is if you just go in and search for certain things like Oh, what

34:36.060 --> 34:38.700
would Nick probably have done live clothes live this just

34:38.700 --> 34:41.860
type in Nick would and whatever you can find a lot of material

34:41.860 --> 34:45.260
this group is almost three years old and it's chock full of

34:45.260 --> 34:47.820
material. Okay. So anyway, just tagged you, bro.

34:50.060 --> 34:55.620
Your clothes on the guy in St. George the excavation guy right

34:55.620 --> 34:57.860
before my first deal. I watched that the night before just to

34:57.860 --> 34:58.780
get a good feel.

34:59.220 --> 35:01.700
Oh, yeah, dude, it's it you know what I used to do every single

35:01.700 --> 35:04.500
day before I hit the doors. I would listen I there was the

35:04.500 --> 35:07.500
guys the top guys making the most amount of money. They had

35:07.500 --> 35:10.460
their pitches recorded and they were put in like our company

35:10.460 --> 35:13.780
training. And I promise you, I would listen like a 20 minute

35:13.780 --> 35:16.940
video. I would listen to Oz making my omelet. I would listen

35:16.940 --> 35:20.620
to it as I get in the shower. I listen to every freaking day. And

35:20.620 --> 35:22.980
you know, it was amazing. I would get on the doors, I would

35:22.980 --> 35:25.020
get at a closing table, somebody would say something and I would

35:25.020 --> 35:28.420
just say this one liner. And it was like exactly like, you know,

35:28.420 --> 35:30.940
this there's this guy named Jordan Williams, it was like one

35:30.940 --> 35:35.460
of the OGs and he had like 400 accounts made how many $100,000

35:35.460 --> 35:39.220
as like a college kid selling selling alarm systems. And I

35:39.220 --> 35:42.260
would say the exact same lines the exact same ways that he

35:42.260 --> 35:45.220
would. And it was like, okay, I'm like programming my

35:45.220 --> 35:49.260
subconscious. So guys, I'm not saying I'm the only person knows

35:49.260 --> 35:54.100
how to close deals. But I scaled quickly we went we were closing

35:54.100 --> 35:58.820
every freaking deal we were on fire. And if you guys want to go

35:58.820 --> 36:02.140
to my 2020 calls, we have probably four or five that you

36:02.140 --> 36:05.220
can listen to. Definitely guys listen to those go to the gym

36:05.220 --> 36:10.100
before your freaking your zoom call. And and listen to that. I

36:10.100 --> 36:12.060
know it's maybe you don't want to maybe you can get on the

36:12.060 --> 36:14.740
treadmill, whatever and just you're going to start hearing and

36:14.740 --> 36:18.420
saying things that I say how I explain the monopoly thing how

36:18.420 --> 36:20.940
I explain this how I explain that the confidence that I have

36:20.940 --> 36:25.060
when I go for the close and help Corey, Corey Gilbert knows

36:25.060 --> 36:27.540
exactly who Jordan Williams is. That's hilarious. Because he

36:27.540 --> 36:33.220
also did door to door. Okay, let's see. Shane Coogan can also

36:33.220 --> 36:36.180
have the screencast. Yes. So they're not screencast. These

36:36.180 --> 36:38.740
are actually recordings. Corey, since you're on this call, so I

36:38.740 --> 36:41.620
just tagged you if you could hook Shane up real quick and tag

36:41.780 --> 36:45.620
Shane on that video as well. That might push it to the top.

36:45.980 --> 36:48.900
But guys, these are these are not record. These are just

36:48.900 --> 36:51.220
recordings. They're not screencasts of me doing live

36:51.220 --> 36:54.300
closes. Okay. Gina says you're gonna check it out. Oh, there we

36:54.300 --> 36:57.900
go. Aaron just barely had went ahead and posted for us. So

36:57.900 --> 37:01.100
guys, in the next 12 minutes, let's let's see what what

37:01.100 --> 37:05.300
questions you guys have. What? This could be about sales, this

37:05.300 --> 37:08.260
could be about losing deals, closing deals, get a 10k. Any

37:08.260 --> 37:10.420
question you have drop in the chat and that what I'm going to

37:10.420 --> 37:15.700
ask you Porter is what have you learned on this journey of

37:15.700 --> 37:21.140
scrapping your way to $10,000 because it has been a scrap

37:21.140 --> 37:25.380
Porter, he went he got to do I think you got to like 85 one

37:25.380 --> 37:29.700
time. Yeah. And then you got busy with farming, which is

37:29.700 --> 37:32.060
natural, you dump some of your business owners weren't super

37:32.060 --> 37:36.580
solid, you lost a couple deals. There was that like you almost

37:36.580 --> 37:39.860
touched it then I think you're at nine and then you dropped and

37:39.860 --> 37:43.740
then you you like turn it back on you're at 9400 and you almost

37:43.740 --> 37:46.580
just had 10,000 you're gonna get 10,000 obviously but like

37:46.600 --> 37:50.700
now you're like give us what have you learned just trying to

37:50.700 --> 37:53.300
hit that 10,000 it's almost like you got this like dark cloud of

37:53.300 --> 37:55.620
doom hanging over your head you're like oh my gosh, I'm not

37:55.620 --> 37:58.020
sure if I can hit it you obviously can but it's sometimes

37:58.020 --> 38:00.660
it's like when you want something so bad. It's like so

38:00.660 --> 38:02.820
hard to hit but yeah, tell us about that.

38:04.220 --> 38:07.340
I honestly even with the last couple deals that I've gotten I

38:07.340 --> 38:10.140
tried to have a different mindset of getting these deals

38:10.140 --> 38:14.500
like instead of like like that 10k is such a big number which I

38:14.500 --> 38:17.260
know I mean it's a lot of money but like in the grand scheme of

38:17.260 --> 38:20.460
things it's not but like to me I've always made it this huge

38:20.460 --> 38:23.820
deal and I feel like it's like psyching me out a little bit you

38:23.820 --> 38:26.380
know I'm saying like I'm this close but then like I make the

38:26.380 --> 38:30.260
zoom call too much pressure like I'm forcing it too much and

38:30.260 --> 38:33.220
like the last couple deals I was like hey if I get to 10k and

38:33.220 --> 38:35.580
because the goal was hey I want to get to 10k and it wasn't even

38:35.580 --> 38:38.040
to get to 10k before I was on farming but like it kind of

38:38.040 --> 38:41.000
worked out that way because I was landing a couple deals and

38:41.000 --> 38:43.080
then I was like dude I gotta hit this like I want to hit it this

38:43.080 --> 38:45.480
month like I was setting goals and we were like trying to get

38:45.480 --> 38:49.560
these things happening and I think I had sales breath I really

38:49.560 --> 38:51.880
do think at the end of the day I should have just been like hey

38:51.880 --> 38:55.760
the goal is 25,000 and when I hit that 20 that hit that 10k

38:55.760 --> 38:59.880
great but like I got to kind of you know I felt like that I was

38:59.880 --> 39:03.160
almost like my end point in my head mentally you know I'm

39:03.160 --> 39:07.520
saying like I just over over hyped it in a way that I kind of

39:07.520 --> 39:09.800
just psyched myself out maybe I was just a little bit too

39:09.800 --> 39:14.400
salesy on the call you know like I was forcing it you know but I

39:14.400 --> 39:17.040
definitely feel like the deals are never perfect every one of

39:17.040 --> 39:19.760
my deals I always expect them to be perfect but every one of

39:19.760 --> 39:22.760
them are are wrong in some way but I end up getting them so

39:22.760 --> 39:26.400
like that's the crazy thing like I'm literally doing prospecting

39:26.400 --> 39:29.800
calls on the tractor I'm like standing over leads with

39:29.800 --> 39:32.280
servando in the background chopping his gum you know I'm

39:32.280 --> 39:35.000
saying like there's there's certain certain things that are

39:35.000 --> 39:37.840
happening but like just you're able to get the deal nothing

39:37.840 --> 39:43.000
needs to be perfect to do it yeah that's a good point I hope

39:43.000 --> 39:45.320
everyone knows that well by the way you're going to get it you

39:45.320 --> 39:47.480
just kind of relax you got to I think what you need to do is set

39:47.480 --> 39:50.480
your targets be like dude I got to get to 25k because I'm

39:50.480 --> 39:53.600
playing small ball and then 10k is just something you got to

39:53.600 --> 39:56.120
pass to get to 20k I think you're making 10k too big of a

39:56.120 --> 39:59.720
deal 10k is not any money dude you you can't do dog diddly

39:59.720 --> 40:03.680
whack on 10k a month and I mean that disrespectfully I just mean

40:03.680 --> 40:05.760
that like if you have that mentality it's like yeah 10k is

40:05.760 --> 40:10.160
just on my way to 50k 10k is on my way to 100k it's just a

40:10.160 --> 40:12.760
little blip in the grand scheme of things honestly the best

40:12.760 --> 40:14.360
money you're ever going to make guys for those of you that

40:14.360 --> 40:17.160
haven't is your very first dollar doing this because that's

40:17.160 --> 40:19.920
going to hit I promise you the hundred dollars I made on the

40:19.920 --> 40:26.560
golf course back in 2018 2017 whatever it was I'm sorry I made

40:26.560 --> 40:29.760
I got my my towing deal back in 2016 because I kind of have two

40:29.760 --> 40:33.040
different in my mind I kind of started twice I started in 2016

40:33.040 --> 40:37.680
I took a break I came back into it but my towing deal for 600

40:37.680 --> 40:40.280
bucks a month and my hundred dollars that I made when I got

40:40.280 --> 40:45.800
back into the game those two payments were sweeter I promise

40:45.800 --> 40:49.120
you this isn't sounds to sound cooler to sound whatever those

40:49.120 --> 40:52.360
are worse sweeter deals those meant more to me those felt more

40:52.360 --> 40:55.240
euphoric than when I made a million dollars and I made one

40:55.240 --> 40:58.120
point five when I made a hundred thousand dollars in a day like

40:58.160 --> 41:02.640
I've done some really cool stuff financially not crazy crazy

41:02.640 --> 41:05.960
but like some cool stuff that I thought was really cool that

41:05.960 --> 41:08.920
hundred dollars when I was on the golf course meant everything

41:08.920 --> 41:13.160
to me but you just have to like set yeah dude 2010,000 nothing

41:13.200 --> 41:15.760
we're gonna get to 50 we're gonna get to 100 but I do

41:15.760 --> 41:17.480
understand what you're saying is sometimes you do have sales

41:17.480 --> 41:19.560
breath so yeah just relax realize you're going to 25

41:19.560 --> 41:25.400
anyway this is just a blip in the radar so what was the other

41:25.400 --> 41:31.760
thing I was gonna say on that note oh I was gonna say this I

41:31.760 --> 41:36.800
like what I love I like love whatever is guys Porter's been

41:36.800 --> 41:41.160
able to do this while doing something entirely different so

41:41.560 --> 41:45.680
his entire summer okay let's let's talk about this early

41:45.680 --> 41:49.720
summer like March April right when we got back from Africa you

41:49.720 --> 41:54.080
got right back into working with dads that was let's say March

41:54.120 --> 41:59.600
April May June July August September October October so the

41:59.600 --> 42:03.960
last eight months okay you've been full time farming okay what

42:03.960 --> 42:07.760
were you at when you got back from Africa in in March how

42:07.760 --> 42:09.120
much were you making per month because I know you had some

42:09.120 --> 42:12.800
deals and you lost some deals were you like six no I think I

42:12.800 --> 42:18.680
was at 45 45 or something well no it might have been 64 think

42:18.680 --> 42:23.800
it was 64 okay point being is that Porter has been able to

42:23.920 --> 42:28.080
maintain his deals by the way he got to six last year while

42:28.080 --> 42:31.160
doing farming but my point is that he's been able to not only

42:31.160 --> 42:34.880
keep his clients but add another $3,000 per month while he's been

42:34.880 --> 42:39.960
working for you know with my dad to learn the ropes of the farm

42:40.200 --> 42:43.960
and this is like very strenuous work sometimes 12 hours a day

42:43.960 --> 42:46.800
sometimes 12 hours a day take a nap go back and work throughout

42:46.800 --> 42:49.160
the night to try and get the hay baled and make sure it doesn't

42:49.160 --> 42:53.600
get rained on sometimes work in 20 hours out of 24 hours and he's

42:53.600 --> 42:56.400
still been able to do it and and sometimes he's taking calls

42:56.520 --> 42:58.800
while he's on the tractor and some of you guys I promise you

42:58.800 --> 43:00.760
would be like oh my gosh it's loud and the business owner it's

43:00.760 --> 43:02.880
not going to be professional and I'm going to wait until I'm off

43:02.880 --> 43:06.080
the tractor or he's got you know we have this guy that works for

43:06.080 --> 43:11.440
my dad that he swear he chews gum louder than anyone on this

43:11.440 --> 43:15.120
planet and you definitely would think you'd lose the deal if you

43:15.120 --> 43:18.200
were doing that next to him and he's just doing it and the point

43:18.200 --> 43:20.360
I'm trying to make guys is that some of you guys are so worried

43:20.360 --> 43:23.160
about everything being perfect that you are not taking any

43:23.160 --> 43:26.560
action and I'm telling you I would rather you like Porter have

43:26.560 --> 43:30.040
you ever had a situation where somebody's like yeah I'm not

43:30.040 --> 43:35.840
going to do it because you don't sound professional no nobody

43:35.840 --> 43:39.240
cares dude a lead to lead is a lead I don't care what you're

43:39.240 --> 43:41.680
doing in the background like yeah okay ideally it's quiet

43:41.680 --> 43:44.840
whatever but at least like you being on the farm it's being

43:44.840 --> 43:47.720
real it's being raw so anyway just want to point that out guys

43:47.720 --> 43:50.960
for those of you that have excuses like I don't have time

43:50.960 --> 43:55.880
I'm busy I got kids also on top of that Porter's wife's been

43:55.880 --> 43:58.640
pregnant the entire time so she's been he's been you know

43:58.640 --> 44:02.480
helping her with that and then also they just had a child was

44:02.480 --> 44:07.360
it like three weeks ago yeah yeah three weeks ago Porter had a

44:07.360 --> 44:12.000
child so I just want to point this guy out guys he's been

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
able to get to 10k over the last two years while doing

44:14.000 --> 44:15.600
something full time that he's going to do for the rest of his

44:15.600 --> 44:19.600
life while his wife's been pregnant they had a baby we've

44:19.600 --> 44:22.240
also moved to Africa he was there for a month like we've

44:22.240 --> 44:25.520
done all this stuff there is time you can do it it's just

44:25.520 --> 44:30.000
about prioritizing so yeah that's it Porter when are we

44:30.000 --> 44:31.680
going to hit 10k dude what are we doing here we're going to

44:31.680 --> 44:33.840
keep that same that same location and we're going to go

44:33.840 --> 44:38.000
get another business owner what's the plan well the goal is

44:38.000 --> 44:40.160
I got to get well I'm going to get another city going I'm

44:40.160 --> 44:43.600
going to have one in the works my problem is I've been I'm not

44:43.600 --> 44:46.880
as prepared so I've had a few weeks where I'm like it's slow

44:46.880 --> 44:49.120
because I don't have one ready to go so I'm going to have one

44:49.120 --> 44:51.920
more ready to go I'm going to let this one sit at the lead

44:51.920 --> 44:54.080
because I'm getting leads it's just been a little bit slower

44:54.080 --> 44:56.560
so I don't want to bag the area completely because I who

44:56.560 --> 45:00.160
literally was the first guy called so I'm going to keep him

45:00.160 --> 45:03.920
I'm going to hook a guy today and I like by the end of the

45:03.920 --> 45:07.600
week I should either be on as it well what is today what

45:07.600 --> 45:09.760
Tuesday by the end of the week hopefully I at least have a

45:09.760 --> 45:12.400
zoom call scheduled or send them enough leads for the

45:12.400 --> 45:16.640
beginning of next week but I'm so close dude I'm so close

45:16.640 --> 45:18.800
you'll get it we're just going to get it and then once he gets

45:18.800 --> 45:21.280
he gets it we'll figure out what he learned by actually

45:21.280 --> 45:24.720
getting the deal but yeah um just go ahead and call that one

45:24.720 --> 45:27.440
quits did he say yeah we're done we're not doing it for sure

45:28.400 --> 45:31.600
no I said the breakup text I saw that he read it but no reply

45:31.600 --> 45:34.640
so I'm just kind of I would just send him a text like best

45:34.640 --> 45:39.520
of luck man yeah like you know what I'm saying like uh the dude's

45:39.520 --> 45:42.000
not doing it and then sometimes that will like get the deal

45:42.000 --> 45:44.560
back that'll get you that control but anyway lesson learned

45:44.800 --> 45:46.720
you know eighteen thousand dollar lesson learned no big deal

45:48.400 --> 45:52.240
just simple anyway guys it happens it's business it's just

45:53.120 --> 45:54.880
better than eighteen thousand dollar lesson than a million

45:54.880 --> 45:58.560
dollar lesson that's the way I look at it and again it's crazy

45:58.560 --> 46:00.400
that we're even talking in these kind of numbers that you

46:00.400 --> 46:02.960
can go out and get a fifteen hundred dollar per month deal

46:02.960 --> 46:05.280
from a skill set that Porter didn't even know how to do two

46:05.280 --> 46:07.360
years ago while he's driving the tractor while he's having

46:07.360 --> 46:09.920
kids while he's freaking doing all this other stuff that's

46:09.920 --> 46:13.200
amazing and Kyle Patton thanks for hopping on at the end of the

46:13.200 --> 46:17.840
