How many ads can you run on regular ads if it's not an MCC?
Good question. Does anyone know? Is there a max?
I've ran like 20 on my brand new account. It's like three weeks old, over 20.
And that's on like one account, the Gmail, one account, and then just 20 campaigns inside of that?
20 campaigns inside of it, yes. I have to like scroll down to see all my smart campaigns.
So we know, Yvette, at least 20. Well, we'll see. I have a feeling Archer's
going to push the envelope on that. Yeah, I'm slapping five more up today.
I love it. Okay.
