1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
All right, guys, let's jump into, I'm gonna get my notes here because I don't want to

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,120
miss anything.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,760
Okay, so first and foremost, last week it was interesting and I don't want this to come

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,880
across wrong.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,600
I used to be the screaming the mic guy and I realized that was just not me.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,920
Actually it is me sometimes, but not always.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,760
But last week was interesting because I was, you know, I woke up in the morning, I forgot,

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm in Dubai so I forgot it was that even Labor Day.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,120
It's weird some holidays that you kind of forget when you're traveling.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,720
But I remembered eventually because my brother Porter, if you guys might know him, he's in

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,720
the free group.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,600
He's about, he's at like 6,400 bucks a month.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,600
It's his birthday, always on Labor Day.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,280
So I remembered and I started thinking back to like previous Labor Days and I don't remember

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,200
any of them, like actually none of them except for one.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,680
And that was in 2017 and I posted about this and I put 18, I think I said six years ago

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,440
but it was actually seven.

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:08,440
This is 2017 and this is literally about five weeks after I failed my first business.

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,840
I got started into RankinRent, I got a couple deals and then I got shiny penny syndrome

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,320
and I thought, man, I think I'm going to start a software company because that sounds cool.

21
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,160
I swear to you, if you think I'm lying, I promise you that when I say that, I literally

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,320
just didn't think it sounded cool to tell people I did marketing.

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,480
That was one of the main determining factors.

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,320
That's how stupid I was as a, how old did I have been, eight years?

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,000
I was like 25 and I was still dumb.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,680
I thought it sounded cool to say I had a software company but now I realize it's cool, no matter

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,040
what you're doing, to make money because that's what really matters, that's what we're here

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
for.

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,480
Anyway, I had got shiny penny syndrome, I chased this software idea, I failed, I lost

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
tons of money.

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,160
I wasted nine months and it came to this boiling point on, it was either July 27th or July

32
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
28th.

33
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,080
I think it was the 28th because that would be, yeah, I think it was the 28th and I'm

34
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,720
in my living room and I'm telling my wife for the fifth, sixth, seventh time, she's

35
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,400
like, so what's going on with the business?

36
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,400
I was so annoyed at this point because nothing, at least for men, I don't know for you ladies

37
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,040
if it's the same, but when my wife would ask me about money, it's like she was questioning

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,240
me as a person and my abilities and it was really, really hurtful and she again was like,

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,760
so what's going on, give me an update and I didn't have one.

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,920
I was like, well, the developer said that we're like two weeks away from beta and he'd

41
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,480
been saying this for like six months.

42
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,760
She finally looked at me and she's like, you know this guy is scamming you, right?

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,400
You know that this is not happening.

44
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,080
I knew as she said it that she was right and essentially without going into too much detail,

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,320
I paid this guy 60 grand, 50 grand and we'd split it, me and a partner, but then I had

46
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,400
bought him out because I found some stuff out.

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,280
So now I was 50, 60 grand in of my own money plus nine months of my time plus the opportunity

48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,480
cost of not going and doing door to door sales.

49
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,480
I had no money.

50
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,760
Like I literally had no money and we had bills due at the first of the month and she's like,

51
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,720
she basically was like, it's time for you to start taking care of this family and it

52
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,600
was like one of those like, my goodness, I needed to hear that and it took me a long

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,720
time to even be able to say that out loud, but it was very embarrassing.

54
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,240
It was, it killed my confidence, but it was that day that I realized like I have to change

55
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,600
and I have a failed business.

56
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,840
My first one's I'm all for one.

57
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,200
I have to make a change and so I went and did the only thing that I knew how was I was

58
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,480
like, dude, where's that program that I bought like a year ago?

59
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,600
Let me just go start selling something and I started watching the training and I was

60
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,560
like, what's the easiest thing to sell and I was like, I'm going to go sell a couple

61
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
of websites.

62
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,080
Let me go sell a couple of websites with SEO and I, so I told my wife, I said, you know,

63
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,960
she's like, I need, you need to call this person, this person, like maybe it's time

64
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,320
you just go get a job and I was like, I can't, like I've talked too much crap.

65
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,160
I'm not going back to my job and which was a door to door salesperson and I'm not going

66
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,400
to get a 95.

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,520
So I said, give me till the first of the month, which was three days from that day and I will

68
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,920
have however much we need and we needed $3,000 to basically cover our bills and she's like,

69
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
okay, sounds good.

70
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,160
I'll give you three days.

71
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,920
No chance I'm getting it and guys in three days out of desperation and it's funny how

72
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,280
humans are like this when our backs up against the wall, we are so creative.

73
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,200
We are so resourceful and in three days I came up with $3,000 cash, sold three websites

74
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,880
and was able to buy myself another 30 days and then so essentially I used SEO to kind

75
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,280
of get me out of that situation and then I transitioned and I just did it too slow and

76
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
I didn't do it correctly.

77
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,840
So whoever it was that said, you know, they're doing SEO, there's nothing wrong with SEO.

78
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,000
There's just a proper way to do it and there's a wrong way to do it and it's very easy to

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,840
get stuck in the wrong way and to chase the money only to end up in a year with nothing,

80
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,780
with no assets, with nothing that you can tie the clients to.

81
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,660
So anyway, the reason I'm telling this whole story, five weeks after this because that

82
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,140
would have been, you know, September, beginning of September, I just remember on Labor Day,

83
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,020
I'd been working my butt off like truly, truly, truly I'd been working my butt off and I made

84
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,020
good money.

85
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,260
I made $3,000 in three days and I made 10,000 bucks my very first month going all in on

86
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,620
SEO and that was cash collected because I needed to.

87
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,780
I had kids, I had bills, all this stuff and Labor Day, I remember it was Sunday night

88
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,980
going into Monday and I thought to myself, like, I want to spend time with my kids.

89
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,740
I was at my parents' house and I was like, I want to go to the parade and, you know,

90
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,300
like spend some time with them because I haven't spent much time but I was like, I need to

91
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,260
like, I got stuff to do and I just remember I woke up, I needed to write 3,000 words of

92
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,260
content.

93
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,420
Yes, I used to write my own content.

94
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:02,340
I wrote my first 300,000 words of content just for the record and I woke up at 4 a.m.

95
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,140
And I sat in my parents' kitchen with it completely quiet and I picked away the keyboard

96
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,100
and I wrote 3,000 words of content before I went to the gym and I showered and went

97
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,420
to the parade.

98
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:19,860
And I remember that because I was so tired, of course, because I woke up at 4 a.m., but

99
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,060
I was so excited to be making money.

100
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,980
I was so, it was so refreshing to know that like even if it was a thousand bucks, it was

101
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,980
my money.

102
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,900
It wasn't, it wasn't relying on somebody else and I was actually making money and it was

103
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,900
so exciting.

104
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:44,180
So, I had that whole, whatever, I made a post about it and then I got on the call and I,

105
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,220
you know, I was going to share this training and there was two people on.

106
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,380
And again, guys, you don't have to work on Labor Day.

107
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,340
Some of you guys aren't in that, most of you guys hopefully aren't in that situation but

108
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,340
I think that the rhetorical question I wanted to ask was like, you know, if you're not where

109
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,740
you want to be, should you be taking Labor Day off?

110
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:09,180
Like if you're not where you want to be, should you be, you know, taking off the Friday, whatever?

111
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,240
And so, I guess rhetorically, I want you guys just to be thinking about this as like either

112
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,180
stop complaining about where you're at or do something about it.

113
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,460
And my dad always used to say this quote to me, if you always do what you've always done,

114
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,460
you always get what you've always got.

115
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,980
And I know it's stupid, it's cliche, and I've heard it a million different times, a million

116
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,620
different ways, but it's so freaking true.

117
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,620
I do the same thing.

118
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,100
We sit and we do the same thing again and again.

119
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,200
We keep coming on these lives.

120
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,340
We keep getting our pencil and our paper and we keep saying, well, I'm going to start that

121
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,780
business but we keep coming up with a reason why we're not going to do it today.

122
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,220
You know, well, we're going to do it once so-and-so graduates.

123
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,900
We're going to do it once, you know, we finish the backyard.

124
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,260
We're going to do it when my job slows down.

125
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:56,580
You have no idea how many people have almost started this business, have almost done it

126
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,380
and then something happens and they don't.

127
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,060
And I just had a friend recently, he's been telling me over and over, I'm so bored at

128
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,060
my job.

129
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,100
Like, whatever, I don't, it's not, I can make so much more money complaining, complaining,

130
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,580
every single time I see him and I'm like, dude, do this.

131
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,160
And he's like, okay, let me move some money around, let me get into your program, whatever.

132
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,340
He pulls money out of his 401k.

133
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,460
He does the whole deal.

134
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,900
And when it comes down to it, I message him and he's like, it should be deposited on Wednesday.

135
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,900
I'm like, so like, are you joining or like, what's the deal?

136
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,500
He's like, he sent me this long text, something came up and I got to just spend some time

137
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
on this person.

138
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,620
And again, it's my friend, but and I didn't say a word back to him because it's my friend

139
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,860
and I just said, hope everything's good, man.

140
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,860
And good luck.

141
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,940
You know, I'm not going to chase you or whatever.

142
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,980
But it was just, it was a reminder that this is how we are as humans.

143
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,860
So rhetorically, I think about this to myself, like I complain that I'm not in a million

144
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
dollars a month.

145
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,340
I don't complain, but I said, why am I not a million dollars a month?

146
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:59,660
And then I'm doing the same stupid stuff that I was doing when I like that I've been doing

147
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,060
and if nothing's going to change and I'm still staying up, like I'll tell you guys, I'll

148
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,060
be honest with you guys.

149
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,780
Last night, you know, my most productive, when I go to bed early on Sunday and I plan

150
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,620
my son on Sunday for my week and I go to bed early, I wake up and I get so much done.

151
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,700
Like I start Monday so strong.

152
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,740
And yesterday I slept in, I didn't plan and I pushed it.

153
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
I'll do it later.

154
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
I'm going to get some food.

155
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,780
I didn't plan until this morning.

156
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,780
I did plan.

157
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,340
It's not till this morning.

158
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,660
And because of that, I didn't have any momentum.

159
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:34,120
So last night somebody sent something to me and all of a sudden I'm on x.com on just looking

160
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
at these threads.

161
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,940
I didn't go to bed till 3 a.m. last night.

162
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,220
That's so bad.

163
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,220
It's so embarrassing.

164
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,420
And I'm telling you guys because number one, I'm not going to lie to you.

165
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,620
Number two, I do the same stupid stuff you guys do.

166
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,060
And number three, it's like, how can I expect to be at a million dollars a month if I'm

167
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,860
still spending two hours of time that I can't get back?

168
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,220
So painful to say on stupid x.com on meaningless threads that I could have read.

169
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,980
I could have written a book or started a book.

170
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,060
I could have made posts.

171
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,060
I could read content.

172
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,060
I could have slept.

173
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,060
I could have called.

174
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,900
I mean, it was so dumb.

175
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,260
So again, guys, I just wanted you guys to understand it and maybe just to like relay

176
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,500
or to share my frustration.

177
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:20,060
And what I'm thinking about is if you're not where you want to be, are you doing anything

178
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,060
different than you've been doing?

179
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,540
And if not, then how do you expect anything to change?

180
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,780
It's actually, it's asinine.

181
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,780
Nothing's going to change.

182
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,140
So that's just a little quick thought.

183
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,060
And with that said, guys, I want to get into what we're going to share today.

184
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,140
Now, again, Jason, if you see comments that are pertinent, cut me off.

185
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,580
Aaron, if you need to cut me off, let me know as well.

186
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,060
And then at the end, we're going to do Q&A.

187
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,060
Okay?

188
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,060
How's it going so far, guys?

189
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,060
Going great.

190
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,060
I think it's going pretty good.

191
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,060
Beautiful.

192
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,060
Okay.

193
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,060
So when do you pull the plug on the city?

194
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,660
That's what we're going to talk about today.

195
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:02,220
My goal, by the way, is that with this specific call, is that by the end of this live, you're

196
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,860
going to have an understanding of my specific criteria for when it's time to pull out of

197
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,140
a city and niche.

198
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,260
But you have to remember that you're only going to perfect this through repetition,

199
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,820
by doing.

200
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,820
And so you can read about it.

201
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,860
You can listen to hundreds of hours of stuff.

202
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:23,980
But until you go in to an area and you lose some money on ads and you feel what it's like

203
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:30,140
to see that money going out the door and, oh my gosh, I might get zero return.

204
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,680
Should I pull?

205
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,780
Until you've done that a ton of times, you're not going to be able to perfect this.

206
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,020
And that's just kind of the reality.

207
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:44,820
So that is my goal with this live, guys, is to have you guys know this criteria doesn't

208
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,060
mean that you have to believe it.

209
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,080
And I don't want you to believe anything that I say without testing it, okay?

210
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,540
So here's the plan, kind of the outline I want to talk about.

211
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:00,020
Number one is I'm going to talk about how picking the right city and niche is the key.

212
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:06,020
We're going to be talking about, you know, deciding when to actually pull out is an art,

213
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,940
not a science.

214
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,600
We're going to be talking about if you are actually generating leads, there's always

215
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,140
a deal to be had.

216
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,940
We're going to talk about the fact that you don't lose money until you quit.

217
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,900
We're going to be talking about my criteria for winning areas put on the chopping block

218
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:27,100
and then my motto in life, but especially in business, okay?

219
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,300
So that said, let's get into it.

220
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:37,620
Number one, man, I always use like the number 17 or I don't know, something about seven,

221
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,820
I always use some random number for the number of times I've said something.

222
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,740
But guys, I have said this so many times.

223
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:52,480
The key to every part of this business, the make or break with this business is picking

224
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,220
the right city and niche combo.

225
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,980
If you do not, if you do not pick the right city niche combo, I don't care how good you

226
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,420
are at SEO, I don't care how good you are at ads, I don't care how good you are at sales,

227
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:12,100
I don't care how quick you can transfer leads, everything is harder.

228
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:19,100
On the other hand, if you get that right, if you get into a juicy freaking right, low

229
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:27,340
hanging fruit, you can do almost everything wrong and still win and it feels light and

230
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,180
it feels exciting and it feels, I don't say easy, but it doesn't feel heavy.

231
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,060
And it's like it's motivating because it happened and you did it quickly.

232
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:42,620
So I just want to stress guys that if you guys are, if you guys do not have the criteria

233
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,180
and you are not confident in what that looks like, you are going to be spinning your wheels

234
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,140
because you're going to, it's going to be hard for you to pull out of a city because

235
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,460
you're going to go, I don't know if that was the right city, maybe I just picked the wrong

236
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,460
city.

237
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,700
But if you know you're in the right city, then you're like, I know this is right because

238
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,220
of this, this, this and this.

239
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,260
It's like these other ones that I was in.

240
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,340
So obviously it's got to be my ads or my landing page or the way that I'm handling these leads

241
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,420
or my cold calling.

242
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,940
But it's so frustrating when you don't know if it's the right city, if you're not getting

243
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,180
leads or you're not having any success to know what the heck is freaking going on.

244
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:24,020
So really quick, what I want to ask, I'm going to have Jason, this is completely, I didn't

245
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,260
tell you I was going to ask this, but do you want to speak on that a little bit?

246
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:34,620
Tell these, I mean, maybe, maybe I'm completely in my own field here, but have you seen that

247
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,620
to be true?

248
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,780
Have you seen that, you know, certain areas it's like, dude, I could do a hundred of these

249
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,860
tomorrow and other areas, everything you do, it seems like you just can't move, you know,

250
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
can't move the needle.

251
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,860
Yeah, for sure.

252
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,820
And every time I try to go against that, then I end up losing that campaign.

253
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,260
So just stick to what works.

254
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,180
Don't, what is it, what's the, what they say in the South, if it ain't broke, don't fix

255
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,180
it.

256
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,620
I've heard that about a thousand times over the course of my door-to-door sales days and

257
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,620
it is so freaking true.

258
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,820
Okay, now next question.

259
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,580
How do I get the perfect framework?

260
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,500
Well, you can go develop your own or you can pay to get mine.

261
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
It's really easy.

262
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Okay.

263
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,460
There's one that, there's 1.8 thousand YouTube videos you could go watch.

264
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,460
And how many live?

265
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,260
Aaron, how many lives do you think we've done inside the free group before we stopped doing

266
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,260
them in the free group?

267
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,820
It was like a solid three years straight.

268
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,980
So like every week, I think I missed two and I was, I was literally in a jungle in Africa

269
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,460
and physically couldn't get on and I didn't plan well.

270
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:44,260
Uh, there, there's probably a hundred, there's gotta be 150 of those things, right?

271
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,260
Cause I did it.

272
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,260
Yeah.

273
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:52,420
Three, like now maybe like 125, 130, 130 times, there's 130 times an hour and 15 minutes

274
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,380
I mean, do the math.

275
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,380
Plus all the posts.

276
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,540
So you either pay with your time or you pay with your money.

277
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,540
That's it.

278
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,460
There's no, you pay the piper.

279
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,780
That's how you get the perfect formula.

280
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,020
So I have it.

281
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,180
You want to buy it.

282
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,380
If you don't, you can go through all the material.

283
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,340
If you think that I know what I'm talking about.

284
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,340
Okay.

285
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,340
That's really simple.

286
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,940
Um, the other option is you go and just do what I did, but you guys have to remember,

287
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,740
even though I did all that I did, I spent four hours, four years, sorry, developing

288
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,140
and trying and testing the perfect due diligence formula.

289
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:32,180
What I think people forget is I also paid, I bought over $23,000 in programs on top of

290
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,780
the four years, four years.

291
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,060
So the fact that some people like, I'm just going to go, I'm just going to go, I'm at

292
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,260
the perfect formula.

293
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,100
That's like thinking that you're going to be like some of these investing companies

294
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,820
that look at a 500 deals a week and know exactly what metrics and exactly what the market should

295
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:56,340
look like and exactly, um, what the, uh, what the cap rate needs to be, the minimum cap

296
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:01,540
rate and the growth of the city and thinking that you're even going to play ball.

297
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,540
Absolutely not.

298
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,540
Okay.

299
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,420
So anyway, I just have to stress to you the importance of picking the right city in the

300
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
niche.

301
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,740
Cause you guys, I'm going to tell you all this stuff, but if you're in the wrong city,

302
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,620
it doesn't matter what you do.

303
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,620
You're screwed.

304
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,620
Okay.

305
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,620
So that's all I want to say.

306
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,060
Um, also I want to give you a little pro tip and I know I've talked about this before,

307
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,500
but I saw some of you guys said you were new, uh, in the comments.

308
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,060
If you aren't looking at CPC, which for the brand, brand, brand new people, that is the

309
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:31,260
cost per click, the cost that it costs you to go to Google and say, put me on page one

310
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,180
and I'll pay every time someone clicks on my ad instead of waiting for him to rank.

311
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:42,180
If you're not looking at the cost, the CPC guys, if you're not factoring that into your

312
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,620
decision of going into an area, that's your business.

313
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,620
Okay.

314
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,660
I've never been advised this from any other course and I've bought a lot.

315
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,500
I've been, I'm in all of them, all the ones that you guys have heard of.

316
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I bought them all.

317
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,900
I'm in, I'm in friends with most of them.

318
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,380
Um, the ones I'm not, they don't like me.

319
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,380
That's fine.

320
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,620
But if you're not looking at CPC, then that's your business, but you should be.

321
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,620
Okay.

322
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,500
Even if you're not going to run ads, you should be looking at CPC and I don't have time to

323
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,500
explain all that, but that is just a pro tip.

324
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Okay.

325
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Next, this is an art, not a science.

326
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
Okay.

327
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,060
I, I've tried to make this as scientific as possible.

328
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:25,220
I've tried my best with, you know, okay, when do we pull out of an area?

329
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,500
Because guys, when I, in 2020, when we went from eight to $10,000 up to a hundred thousand

330
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,060
dollars a month in an eight month window, we were running campaigns.

331
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,820
We were spending money on ads.

332
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:41,020
We were hustling and bustling and shuffling and we had how many in the queue and how many

333
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,180
getting set up and we, I knew to the second, it was like, I think it was like four minutes

334
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,300
and 32 seconds or five minutes and 32 seconds.

335
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,940
I could set up an ad and it was exactly the same copy and paste the keyword.

336
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,300
I knew exactly what I was doing to, to a freaking team.

337
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:05,700
And even then, even then I was always surprised here and there, even knowing every single

338
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,380
factor that I did.

339
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,620
I want you guys to understand that this is an art, not a science.

340
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,620
Okay.

341
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,220
When you spend X amount, then you pull out.

342
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,900
But the problem is, is it's like, well, maybe you spent X amount of dollars on ads in the

343
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,500
wrong city or in the right city, but the wrong time of year, or in the wrong right city and

344
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:33,540
the right time of year, but you didn't do the right ad, like there's so many factors

345
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,420
that you just have to understand.

346
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,660
This is an art, not a science and instead of being frustrated by that, I think you should

347
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:46,060
be excited by that because this is how I always think about things that are hard or that take

348
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:52,260
time and effort and thought and creativity and whatever.

349
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,420
Like when Google comes out with a GMB update, everyone's like, oh my gosh, I get excited

350
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,420
about it.

351
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,540
And I don't want to try and, I don't want this to sound like I'm regurgitating information

352
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:08,100
that people are saying online, but if you really think about it, if it's hard, it's

353
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,860
just pushing people away that aren't willing to go through it.

354
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:16,060
And so the fact that this is an art and a lot of this business is an art, there's a

355
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,040
reason we call the Facebook group the art of digital real estate.

356
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,140
And we call it the art of pre-selling is because no one wants an art.

357
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,980
Everyone wants to have an exact, perfect, when this happens, then do this.

358
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,020
Guys, that's just not life.

359
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,580
And if you need those answers and you want to live a life that's like, if this happens

360
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,860
then you're more going to be more comfortable, more secure in a nine to five type of a setting.

361
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,500
And I don't mean that in any disrespectful way because that's okay.

362
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,640
But this might not be for you.

363
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,700
This is an art, not a science.

364
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,040
And it's just like with stock market, guys, there's no exact science for how long you

365
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,700
should stay in a stock.

366
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,340
Guys, I invested in 2014.

367
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:07,140
I worked the entire summer door to door sales, sweat buckets of sweat, got rejected thousands

368
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,740
of times, all kinds of different stuff, lost sleep, got in fights with my wife because

369
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,660
of this, that and the rest and how tired I was, whatever, right?

370
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,420
Missed time with my kids, spent that entire summer doing door to door sales.

371
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,100
And Jason did some of that as well.

372
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,100
So he knows my pain.

373
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,780
Some of you guys might have as well.

374
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:30,700
And I made that year, I think it was $130,000, okay, basically.

375
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,700
That's gross.

376
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,020
And I think I probably put like one 10 in my pocket.

377
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,180
Didn't have a ton of expenses, but I did have some.

378
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:44,340
And I spent of that, I spent, I put 40 or 50, I think it was 50, no, it was 50, not

379
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,340
40.

380
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,340
$50,000.

381
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,340
So I lived on part of it.

382
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,800
Keep in mind, I lived on part of it.

383
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:56,080
And then I spent the majority of the money I had left and I put it on a stock, on one

384
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,440
stock that was going to IPO.

385
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,660
And it was the company I worked for, Vivint, it's called Vivint Solar.

386
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:07,600
And Vivint Solar, just before that, Alibaba had, if you guys are familiar with that, it's

387
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,240
like the Chinese Amazon, they had gone public.

388
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,960
And literally, I don't know, their stock like 13X or something.

389
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
And I started doing the math.

390
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,160
I was like, yo, if I put in 10,000 bucks in this team, 13Xs.

391
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:27,040
And if it does half of that, then that six, how can I lose?

392
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,720
And to be fair, our bosses, our regional managers, they were telling all of us, get all the money

393
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,480
you can get, put your entire back end of check into this company.

394
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,880
If you got to go to your dad and borrow money.

395
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,240
Anyway, I put $50,000 in the stock and this thing, I put it in and not only did it not

396
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,020
go up, it literally the day after it was down, it would have been better for me to buy in

397
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,760
at the regular price.

398
00:22:52,760 --> 00:23:00,080
And for the entire time, guys, that I was in the stock, I was losing the money.

399
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,000
But the crappy part is, I didn't know when to pull out.

400
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,960
I didn't know if I should keep it in, whatever.

401
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,840
And I pulled out, this is so, it's embarrassing.

402
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,760
I pulled out at the beginning of 2020 and it was, instead of being worth 50,000, which

403
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,020
it had gone down to being worth about 10, it had bumped up to like 25.

404
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:26,720
So I swelled up a bit and I was like, dude, I'm going to take half my money and just get

405
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
out of this thing.

406
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
And I did.

407
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,400
I cashed out and I promised you guys like two months later, that thing was not only

408
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,520
worth what I originally bought in, but it was worth like 50% more.

409
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,120
If I would have waited two more months, I waited six years.

410
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,600
And if I would have waited six years and two months, I would have made money, like enough

411
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,360
that it would have been worth my money being in there the entire time, okay?

412
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,940
My point being, that's an art.

413
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,260
This is an art.

414
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,640
Some of the best things in life are art.

415
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
Life is art.

416
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,560
And you just got to get comfortable with that, okay?

417
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
All right.

418
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,760
Number three thing I want to say, if you guys are generating leads in an area, if you have

419
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:13,000
a website that's organically getting leads from the GMB, from the organic rankings, from

420
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,160
whatever it is, if you are getting leads, there is always a deal to be made.

421
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,000
If you're running ads and that ad campaign and that landing page is producing consistent

422
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,600
leads, there is always a deal to be had.

423
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,840
And in the same way that my stock, with my stock example, you do not lose money until

424
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,880
you pull out.

425
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,640
You do not lose money until you quit.

426
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,560
And what I mean by that is, let's say in a hypothetical situation that Aaron goes and

427
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,160
sets up a campaign for minneapolisconcrete.com.

428
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,360
And Aaron, he spends 150 bucks, right?

429
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360
And he has no business owner.

430
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,360
He's gotten some leads.

431
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,020
He's hooked a couple of business owners.

432
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,560
He's tried to get on the Zoom with two of them.

433
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,460
He's 0 for 2.

434
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,100
Or maybe he's only, he's 0 for 1.

435
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,020
If Aaron quits and he's like, dude, this doesn't work, Nick's full of crap, digital real estate

436
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,820
is a baloney, I'm going to do drop shipping, I'm going to do freaking e-com, whatever,

437
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,120
I'm going to go to my 95, that's fine.

438
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,440
That is the only way that Aaron could lose money.

439
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,740
Because Aaron, let's say he's at $250 spent, he has no deal.

440
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,540
But he's like, dude, I'm going to double down.

441
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,440
This area is producing leads.

442
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,540
I know I'm going to get a business owner.

443
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
I just got to get creative.

444
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,460
I just got, it's just that next one.

445
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,460
And he spends $500.

446
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,780
He doubles his spend, okay?

447
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,980
But on the last person, he gets the deal.

448
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,080
It's $1,500 a month or even $1,000 a month.

449
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,060
He gets the deal, signs a six-month contract.

450
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,060
Guess what?

451
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:49,400
Every single dollar that he spent to get to that deal, he recouped instantly.

452
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,940
And he's positive.

453
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,100
And that doesn't mean he had to stay in Minneapolis.

454
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,820
That could mean he was in Minneapolis.

455
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,700
He determined, yes, indeed, this is too competitive.

456
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
I didn't listen to Nick.

457
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,980
The CPC was too high.

458
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:06,460
I'm going to shift to a smaller city in Minnesota or I'm going to shift states because this

459
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,460
isn't a great state.

460
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,900
I'm going to go to Tampa and I'm going to set it up.

461
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,700
And he spends $250 in Tampa.

462
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,620
As long as he doesn't decide to quit and he keeps doing it until he gets that first deal,

463
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,620
he doesn't lose his money.

464
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,620
Okay?

465
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:25,680
And the way I view it, guys, is you're spending money that you're spending the customer's

466
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,680
money.

467
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Right?

468
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:33,000
Every time I turn on ads, I'm spending my customer that's about to sign with me is the

469
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,320
way I do it.

470
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,320
Why?

471
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,040
Because I'm not stopping until I get a deal.

472
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,600
Guys, I'll spend $1,000.

473
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,320
I'll go 0 for 20 because I know eventually I'm going to get a deal.

474
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,320
And even if I spend, by the way, I don't think I've ever spent $1,000.

475
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,360
I think the most I've ever spent is a couple hundred.

476
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,000
But I'm just using an extreme example.

477
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,080
I'll spend $1,000 because I know that even if I do get the deal, month one, I break even

478
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,800
and now I'm making money.

479
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Okay?

480
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,240
So you guys have to remember that you get in and you start putting a little bit of money

481
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,560
on a credit card and you're like, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, I'm losing money.

482
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,920
No, you don't lose money until you quit.

483
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
Okay?

484
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,320
You don't lose money until you walk away.

485
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,800
Just like I wouldn't have lost that money until I pulled out.

486
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,460
If I would have waited until it, hey, just fix your head, dude.

487
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,520
It's got to come back up or you're leaving it in.

488
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,520
I would have made money.

489
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
Okay?

490
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
So that's the deal.

491
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
Okay.

492
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,240
So now we're going to get into the juicy stuff.

493
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,760
We're going to talk about my criteria for winning areas, put on the chopping block.

494
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,640
But what I'm going to do really, really quick, Jason, do we have any comments?

495
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,640
We don't have any comments yet.

496
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Nope.

497
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
Okay.

498
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,280
So what I'm going to do, just one, give me, I just have to plug my computer in.

499
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,280
I'm at a nice 2%.

500
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Hold on.

501
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,280
It's going to kick off one of my lights.

502
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
My bad.

503
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Hold on.

504
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:54,600
Just a thought on why Nick has been saying this.

505
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,360
What he's saying is it's so important to actually find the right business owner.

506
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,600
So he's willing to spend extra money to find the right business owner and not just take

507
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,960
the first person who's going to pay him.

508
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,000
Very good point.

509
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Very good point.

510
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,400
Just because you can get money, just because someone's willing to give you money doesn't

511
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,000
mean you should take it.

512
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,760
And I say this, this is just like, just because something's free doesn't mean you should accept

513
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
it.

514
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,720
Specifically inside the free group, when I see people, we try to get rid of all the clowns,

515
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,720
but like I see people like, oh, I have this genius landing page.

516
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
DM me.

517
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,720
It's like, bro, do you even make money?

518
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,200
And I call these people out.

519
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
I don't know.

520
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Was it Aaron?

521
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,080
Were you on that thread with that kid that was like going ballistic on me because I called

522
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
him out on the group?

523
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,320
Was that you or that Kyle?

524
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Must have been Kyle.

525
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,320
Okay.

526
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,360
Anyway, some kid, he did something like that and I called him out publicly and then he's

527
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,360
like, you're being a dick.

528
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,680
I'm like, don't come in my group.

529
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
Says right there.

530
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Don't be a dick.

531
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,760
Anyway, let's talk about my criteria for when I put an area on the chopping block.

532
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,140
Again, guys, this is me.

533
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,600
This is my criteria.

534
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
What do I know?

535
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,680
Well, I know that real quick.

536
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
I know how to make.

537
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Sorry, bro.

538
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:19,920
I was just going to say real quick, the audio is fine, but the video is really lagging choppy.

539
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,840
Just on a side note, you know, you know what, I don't know if that's what I think it is.

540
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,840
I think it's what I'm charging.

541
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,480
I just kind of said again, pretty rough.

542
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,840
How's the audio now?

543
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,160
What if I just turn the camera off for a second?

544
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
How's the audio?

545
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
Fine.

546
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
Yeah, it's fine.

547
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,680
You know, I think it's I think it's when I plug in my computer to charge it at the same

548
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
time.

549
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
We're just going to go with the camera off for a second.

550
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Everyone can hear me.

551
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,360
OK, so, yeah, my computer is at two percent.

552
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,360
Otherwise, I do.

553
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,920
It's got to be some weird thing with because I got like a power converter and just all

554
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
kinds of stuff going on.

555
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
I got it's quite a mess here.

556
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,920
I'm going to start a fire in my in my apartment.

557
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,560
So guys, let's talk about my criteria.

558
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,000
What I was about to say, though, is I was saying, you know, these are my criteria.

559
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
What do I know?

560
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,120
And I was going to say, I know how to make a million dollars a year doing this.

561
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,640
So that could be important.

562
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
So here's my criteria.

563
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,680
I've got a couple criteria, but I think you guys are going to be a little bit surprised

564
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,680
by this.

565
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,640
OK, so and again, we didn't even announce this at the beginning.

566
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:25,120
But what we're going to do is, well, I think we've already created this, Aaron.

567
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,840
I don't know if you've included this in it, but typically what we do on these calls is

568
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,280
if you stay till the end with your camera on, we're going to screenshot everybody here

569
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:41,280
And we're going to send you the digital resource that we've created from this training.

570
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,800
So but just in case this wasn't put, I would I would write these things down.

571
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,720
OK, I just create that link, a Google Drive link.

572
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,480
So I'll drop it in the comments at the end of the column.

573
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,880
People can just download the PDF.

574
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,080
That's amazing. That's amazing.

575
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:00,040
And also, I think what we are going to do, too, is anyone that stays on, we were going

576
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:07,880
to do the the we were going to give them the early access to the next podcast episode,

577
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,160
which is going to is going to drop on Thursday.

578
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,920
So Aaron, if you want to grab that Vimeo link, make it unlisted.

579
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,960
We can drop that at the end as well.

580
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,160
Sounds good.

581
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,800
So if you guys stay till the end, I don't even know what how many of you have on 10,

582
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,640
15, 5, I see 21, including us.

583
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,640
How many?

584
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,160
21, including us.

585
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,600
Beautiful. OK, so there's 18 people, basically.

586
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,440
You guys stay to the end.

587
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,040
We're going to give you guys the digital resource and early access, three days early

588
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,720
access to the latest podcast, which what was the name of the latest podcast we did?

589
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:48,280
It was the oh, the perfectly the the the perfectly broken business model.

590
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,200
I think it was titles like that.

591
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,840
It's just recorded like two days ago.

592
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,840
So, guys, here's my criteria.

593
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,240
These are things I would consider writing down.

594
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:03,720
And this is when when these things happen, this puts the area on a chopping block for me.

595
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:13,240
OK, number one is I have spent at least one hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars on ads.

596
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,960
I've made adjustments to the ads.

597
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,200
And or the landing page, and I'm still not generating leads.

598
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,760
So I go, I spend 50 bucks, I got nothing, I'm still going.

599
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,720
I spent 100 bucks, I got nothing, I'm still going.

600
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,080
Even if I spent 150 bucks, if I see that there's a lot of impressions and whatever,

601
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,120
and it just looks like there's going to be there should be, you know,

602
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,720
like logically, there should be leads in that area.

603
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,440
I know there's volume.

604
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,560
So there's something that's off.

605
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,320
Well, you know, I'm going to keep going.

606
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,760
OK, so if I'm not getting leads and I've spent that kind of money.

607
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,520
And guys, remember.

608
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:59,080
This is like a totally separate training, but just be logic, be use your intuition.

609
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:05,080
If you're getting impressions on your ads, that means it's being shown to people.

610
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,000
But if you're getting impressions and you're not getting clicks, your ads either suck

611
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
or they're getting shown to the wrong people because no one's clicking on them.

612
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,520
If you're getting clicks, that means you're spending money, but nobody's calling.

613
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,920
You're not getting leads.

614
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:26,320
That means you're getting clicks from the wrong people, the wrong traffic or your landing page sucks.

615
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,440
And I want to say this because for me, when I say I'll spend 150 to 200 dollars,

616
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,640
I know that my landing page is going to convert because I've just tested it so many times.

617
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,520
I've spent over a million dollars testing it.

618
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,160
I know that it's going to convert.

619
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,200
I know what to what my audience looks like.

620
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,840
So it's very rare for me.

621
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,080
And I also know I've chosen the right area because I know how to choose an area

622
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,120
because I've done it so many times wrong.

623
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,560
But if I spend 150 to 200 bucks and I'm not getting leads, something ain't right.

624
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,720
OK, that's a situation where I would move to a new area.

625
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,320
OK, I ain't quitting. I'm not stopping.

626
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,160
I'm going to keep going, but I'm going to choose a new area.

627
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,800
Maybe I choose a different city that's near there, you know, that kind of thing.

628
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,480
Let's say I'm targeting Vegas or let's say I'm targeting Henderson, Nevada.

629
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,520
That might be a situation where I'm like, all right, I didn't want to target Vegas,

630
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,760
but maybe I need to target Vegas because Henderson's not producing any leads type of a situation.

631
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,120
But 150 to 200 dollars, I've made adjustments to my ads and I'm still not getting leads.

632
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,600
That thing's going on the chopping block and it's getting ready to get plugged.

633
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,720
They're getting ready to get pulled. OK.

634
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,840
OK, that's number one.

635
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,480
Let's see. Number two.

636
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,240
OK, that's it. That's it. That's basically my rule.

637
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,440
These other things, I'm going to go over them.

638
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,440
But like this is what this is the notes that I have outside of that, guys,

639
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,000
outside of me spending 150 to 200 dollars on ads and, you know,

640
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,120
tweaking the leads or tweaking the ads, you know, whatever.

641
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,920
I know I've got the right city because I know my process.

642
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,680
Unless that happens.

643
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,760
I am going to get a deal.

644
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,240
I like I just know and that was one of the things I said at the beginning.

645
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,880
If you are getting leads, there's always a deal to be had.

646
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,720
You might have to, you know, get creative.

647
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,120
You might have to go find somebody on a Facebook Facebook group.

648
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,080
You might have to go find somebody in a neighboring town.

649
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,400
You might have to go find somebody in a different business,

650
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,000
but that also does that service.

651
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,600
OK, you might have to make a post on Facebook and make a post on your story.

652
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,800
There is always a deal. If there are leads coming in,

653
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,960
there is always a deal to be had.

654
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,680
So for me, I ain't pulling out of no area because I can't get a deal.

655
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,400
If there's leads coming in, I am going to go there.

656
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,120
OK, now there is a small caveat because I know sometimes you do something,

657
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,640
you do something, you do something, and it's just like, gosh, dang it.

658
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,440
I need to just take a break.

659
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,960
I'm not if I'm getting leads, that area is mine.

660
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm not giving up on it.

661
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,320
There have been occasions where I'm like, all right,

662
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,920
I feel like I pitched everybody.

663
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,640
I need a new set of eyeballs on this.

664
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,200
Let me go ahead and pause this campaign.

665
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,520
I'll set up another one in a neighboring city

666
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,760
or turn on one of my other ones because I've already got one ready.

667
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,080
I'll go and run that, get a deal, and I'll come back to that first one.

668
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,520
OK, maybe I'll wait for a different time of the year.

669
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,200
Maybe I'll wait for, you know, the election to finish or some big news

670
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,760
or tax, but I am not giving up on the area.

671
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,480
I am getting leads in an area with ads, with organic.

672
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,760
I'm going to get a deal.

673
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,600
And that's just the mentality that I have.

674
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,320
So there is there is one rule that I have, and that is that if I've spent

675
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,960
one hundred fifty to two hundred dollars and I know that I'm in the right city,

676
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,280
I have my landing page is good and I'm not getting leads.

677
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,920
Something ain't right.

678
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,720
OK, and and that's the only time I'm pulling out. Period.

679
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,520
OK, so the truth is, guys, is that

680
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,920
if it's if if I'm getting leads, there is always a deal to be had. OK.

681
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,560
That that's it. And if not, guys, if I'm getting no clicks

682
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,080
and only impressions, like I told you guys, if you're only getting impressions,

683
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,800
it's probably getting shown to the wrong people or your ads suck.

684
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,880
And if you're getting clicks, but no leads, then you're probably getting

685
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,320
the wrong people clicking on it or your your landing page sucks.

686
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,040
And you just need to start making adjustments. OK, that's it.

687
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,240
So, guys, like for me, if you find the mentality, there is always a deal.

688
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,720
I will always get a deal.

689
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,960
There was one of my first projects.

690
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,720
In fact, my very first one was towing huntsville.com.

691
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,680
I've since sold the website.

692
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,040
I got a deal. I got it's like 700 bucks a month.

693
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,400
And it was like two, three months. They paid me.

694
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,960
They wanted to pay me in a check.

695
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,360
I didn't really know how to do stripe, whatever.

696
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,760
And it was kind of cool to get a check instead of a stripe.

697
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,160
I liked getting them in the mail, which was stupid.

698
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,320
But that's just how it was.

699
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,600
I didn't want to spend three percent.

700
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,360
All that stuff. Two point nine seven or whatever.

701
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,400
Client cancels.

702
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,520
And I had to find somebody else.

703
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,280
And I did find somebody else for a minute.

704
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,600
And then I couldn't after that, I could not for the life of me find someone.

705
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,720
Guys, I went through every single business owner.

706
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,000
I was given every I could.

707
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,480
It's like I couldn't give away leads fast enough.

708
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,320
I was trying everybody and anybody.

709
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,760
And I almost just gave up on this thing.

710
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,960
I was like, dude, I'm getting leads.

711
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,800
Why? Why is no one taking these?

712
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,520
You know, this area just must not be good.

713
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:19,680
And finally, I I was in this cash crunch and a friend of mine offered.

714
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,920
He's like, do you have any websites you want to sell?

715
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,640
I was like, well, I have this one that's producing a bunch of leads.

716
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,320
He's like, yeah, but if you don't have a client, it's not really valuable to me.

717
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,840
And I was like, yeah, he's right.

718
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,080
So I just I remember it was December of 2019.

719
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,720
The same December of 2019 that I decided to frickin go all in on this

720
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,680
and to stay in this as I went.

721
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,320
And I went into a Facebook group and I just started cold calling people.

722
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,600
I didn't even I didn't give I was so done.

723
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,080
I was if there was a name and a phone number,

724
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,320
I didn't even I didn't even need to know the company name.

725
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,480
And I saw this one comment.

726
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,840
I remember it was a December day.

727
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,720
It was so bloody cold outside, because I just went for a run.

728
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,280
I came inside and I called this number.

729
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,160
And I didn't know the company name, and I just pitched them.

730
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,240
And I ended up frickin closing this guy for 500 bucks a month.

731
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,640
Put him in a six month contract.

732
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,600
And I flipped the site and sold it for nine thousand bucks to a friend of mine,

733
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,840
which, by the way, he's made way more than that.

734
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,480
So it was a win win for everybody.

735
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,280
But the point is, there is always a deal to be had.

736
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,400
OK, if I'm getting leads and I'm not hooking business owners, that's on me.

737
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,560
If you're getting leads and you're not hooking business owners

738
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,280
or closing business owners, that's on you.

739
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,320
If I'm getting leads and hooking business owners, but I'm not closing,

740
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,520
that's on me. OK.

741
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,520
And guys, to just wrap up on that point.

742
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,760
My motto is always either yes.

743
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,640
Or not now, maybe later.

744
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,080
OK, I don't let people tell me no.

745
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,040
Yes, or not now, maybe later.

746
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,120
We've done an entire training on this inside digital landlords.

747
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,320
But if I go if I if I cold call somebody.

748
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,760
I do not let them tell me no.

749
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,120
I have a way that I can I can leave that door open.

750
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,920
I never close doors. I never slam doors.

751
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,000
I never burn bridges. I try my best not to, at least,

752
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,080
because I know that this is a long game.

753
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,480
And guys, if you guys are in this to make legit real money,

754
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:21,600
do not get knows, do not burn bridges, do not freaking blaze through areas.

755
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,520
Because the people that tell, you know, today

756
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,520
that are going through something tragic or in the middle of a divorce

757
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,920
or in a financial in three years, those same people will surprise you.

758
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,920
They're in a completely different situation,

759
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,080
maybe in a completely different business, and they will buy leads from you.

760
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,680
And I've had this happen not once, not twice, but probably five different times

761
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,120
where today I almost had the deal.

762
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,240
They were interested and they said no, or they they weren't interested today.

763
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,120
And I said, OK, let's talk down the road.

764
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,800
And I followed up three years later or they saw my post

765
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,640
or they reached out to me and said, hey, can I get some leads?

766
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,240
And I got the freaking deal.

767
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,360
So my motto in life in general is I don't I don't take knows, man.

768
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,200
I don't I never take those.

769
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,520
I leave every single door open

770
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,400
because it's either yes or not now, maybe later.

771
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,680
And that's that's the truth.

772
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,200
So, guys, my my criteria for the chopping block.

773
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,880
Is basically unless unless I've spent 150 to 200 bucks,

774
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,760
made some adjustments on ads

775
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,640
and I'm not getting leads and I am getting clicks.

776
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,880
Then I'm I'm in that area.

777
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,080
And why why can I be this confident?

778
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,240
Because I know what a good area looks like.

779
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,040
I know what what it needs to look like.

780
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,800
I know what kind of search volume needs to have.

781
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,800
I know what the CPC needs to be.

782
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,320
I know those things, and that gives me the confidence

783
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,000
to stay in an area until I get a deal.

784
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,240
OK, Jason, let's go through at nine minutes.

785
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,520
Do we have any questions, any comments?

786
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,400
If not, we'll wrap it up.

787
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,120
Yeah, Kirk was just agreeing with the business owners.

788
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,960
He said he's one thousand dollars.

789
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,000
Looks like he's one thousand euros in on ads

790
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,440
for business owners, and he's still in it.

791
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,120
So he says spot on with the business owners.

792
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,120
I didn't validate mine and lost money on all of them.

793
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,600
Be good. He says it would be good to get tips

794
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,120
on validating the business owners.

795
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,440
So Kirk, maybe mean you can just jump on a call, man,

796
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,160
and I can just show you some tips on that.

797
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,440
So just reach out to Donnie Dre after this call.

798
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,000
That's a good idea.

799
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And Kirk, you're crazy if you don't take him up on that.

800
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,840
By the way, I appreciate you doing that.

801
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,440
Yeah, that's so just real quick tips on that.

802
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,000
I'd need more context, but don't be afraid

803
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,920
to do a pullback on the initial call.

804
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,200
That's my tip.

805
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,040
I think sometimes we get in, we want to get some free leads.

806
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
If I'll give you some free leads, we'll do a call.

807
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,920
And we're so excited that they didn't like yell at us

808
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,640
and we're so excited, they're showing a little bit of interest.

809
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,880
We're like that person in high school that never went on a date.

810
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,760
And then the first person out, they like go bananas

811
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,720
because they show him some attention.

812
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,400
It's pathetic. OK, don't don't do that.

813
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,520
Like at the end of the call, if you're unsure, say that say,

814
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,720
Mr. Business Owner, real quick, I'll give you some free leads.

815
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,560
Like, shoot me straight, man.

816
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,800
Are you just looking for free leads?

817
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,640
Because if you're just looking for free leads, like, let me know.

818
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,400
I'll give you a free or you want to grow your company.

819
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,120
Like, are you going to answer my call when I call you?

820
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:18,800
Are you going to?

821
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,920
Because I'm trying to I'm trying to run a business here.

822
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,600
I'm going to let you try this for free.

823
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,400
There's no absolutely no strings attached yet.

824
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,080
But I am here to earn your business.

825
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,480
And if you're not interested in talking

826
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,600
and you're just telling me what I want to hear, dude, I'm a big boy.

827
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,960
I'm a big girl. Just tell me right now.

828
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,520
And that terrifies some of you to say that.

829
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,400
But guys, say it, because if they're interested, they're going to go,

830
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,240
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm super interested.

831
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,680
Sorry, I'm busy.

832
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,160
Or if they're not, you're going to give them an opportunity to just

833
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,360
freaking walk away and go call somebody else, because that's as Jason said.

834
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,960
The right business owner is so important.

835
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,720
And you guys are going to it's going to happen to you.

836
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,800
You're going to get business owners that give you their money today.

837
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,440
And they're just not the right fit.

838
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,480
And you want to get that money.

839
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,080
You want to take it so bad.

840
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,520
But it's not the right decision, because if you get that deal today,

841
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,200
you're locked in a six month contract with somebody

842
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,200
who's not going to be with you in a year.

843
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,400
And then in six months, you're going to have to get somebody new.

844
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,720
And that might be the time.

845
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,800
It's like winter.

846
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,200
And you have to make these big boy, big girl decisions of

847
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,000
even though I can take money today, it's not the right money.

848
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,040
It's not the long term money.

849
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,280
It's not the big money.

850
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,240
And that's a hard, mature thing that you have to you have to learn.

851
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,800
OK, so anything else?

852
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,120
Um, John Fahm, he shared one of his areas with the CBC.

853
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,600
And then, yeah, so I just recommended that, you know,

854
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,760
if you do find a good area,

855
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,720
I would encourage you to kind of keep it to yourself also,

856
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,840
especially with like sharing it with people publicly.

857
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,840
It's a Jamesville, Wisconsin.

858
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,840
Does he say what what niche concrete?

859
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,800
Yeah, beautiful.

860
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,120
I'm going to text my team right now and get it.

861
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,480
No, I'm just kidding, bro.

862
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,520
But he says he doesn't really mind.

863
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,440
But to be honest, like, I like to keep my areas to myself

864
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,120
just because that area has potential making you money.

865
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,000
So personally, I like to keep my areas to myself.

866
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,680
I don't share with people because people jump on that and try and take it.

867
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,600
A lot of people are lazy about doing their their due diligence.

868
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,000
So just be aware of that.

869
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,040
Yeah, I know that.

870
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,520
I would just pop in real quick.

871
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,400
You said concrete in Wisconsin.

872
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,000
Just the thought that might not be great

873
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,480
because I think it gets pretty cold in Wisconsin.

874
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,240
And so if you are to go there, you might just possibly want to plan

875
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,120
on it being more of a nine months, a year deal,

876
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,760
assuming that concrete business is like practically shut down

877
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,480
during the winter month period.

878
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,120
You can I mean, still, like if you have a deal going like six

879
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,720
to nine months out of the year, that's awesome.

880
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,480
Obviously, even if it's only a thousand bucks a month, I'm just

881
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,600
that's just a thought as well.

882
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,520
It's a good point.

883
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,920
And I think there's a way you could do it for the year,

884
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,560
but you just need to go in with the right intention.

885
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,120
And what I would do, I'd still do a 12 month deal,

886
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,040
but I'd just pitch it really hard.

887
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,920
Like, hey, this is a year thing.

888
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,840
Like, I only sell a year contract.

889
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,320
It is going to be really slow during the year during December.

890
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,960
So I can either do one of two things

891
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,840
and you can make the one thing seem way better than the others.

892
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,160
I can either pause you for three months and charge you, you know,

893
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,480
fifteen hundred bucks a month for the other nine months.

894
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,960
Or we could just do a thousand bucks a month and you pay year round.

895
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,440
And there's a couple of months you're going to be shut down.

896
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,840
So now they have a perceived savings of a couple of thousand bucks.

897
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,440
They stay with you year round.

898
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,320
You've let them know up front that that's going to happen

899
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,560
and that is going to happen.

900
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,600
And they're just going to be somebody else.

901
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,120
So very important point.

902
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,840
Doesn't mean you can't go into these states, guys.

903
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,080
Doesn't mean you can't go to these areas.

904
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,240
But if you can, I would keep looking, looking to something that's,

905
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,560
you know, Wisconsin's probably good for something that's not that's not concrete.

906
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,480
But again, this comes from experience and nothing sucks more.

907
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,240
And as soon as it starts to get cold, people start calling you, hey, bro,

908
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,320
let's go ahead and pause this bad boy.

909
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,400
And you're like, dude, I can't pause.

910
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,440
Well, OK, I'm sorry.

911
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,880
So good point, Aaron.

912
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:05,520
Awesome.

913
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,320
And I'm just dropping in the chat right now, the link.

914
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,040
I know we're going to be wrapping it up here in a few minutes.

915
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,000
That's just a link to the Google Drive that's housing the PDF

916
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,400
for the cheat sheet for today's live.

917
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,480
And for those of you that are still on, let me put in the Vimeo link

918
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,520
for early access to these podcasts.

919
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,720
So that's kind of cool.

920
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,760
I've never been part of a when people leave review.

921
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,520
Can we see the name of the person that left a review on the podcast?

922
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,560
It depends on what I think you can only leave reviews on Spotify,

923
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,280
but I'm not too sure.

924
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,880
Well, I'll just let you guys know reviews help.

925
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,600
We appreciate it.

926
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,800
If you guys do leave a review, send me a screenshot posted in the group.

927
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,640
I'll try to hook you guys up with some swag on the next live.

928
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,440
Because those things mean a lot to us.

929
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,480
That's only if you like the podcast and you've actually listened.

930
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,200
I don't want you lying.

931
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,240
I don't want you saying it's good if you don't think it's good.

932
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,960
But we really, really appreciate that.

933
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,680
But yeah, that podcast, that that the one you just shared.

934
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,520
Do you guys go to Spotify or Apple type in digital realistic secrets?

935
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,520
That one is not out and it's not going to be released until Thursday

936
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,040
7 a.m. or 5 a.m. or something like that.

937
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,040
Awesome. Yeah, I just I'm editing.

938
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,560
I put in it was from last week's.

939
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,320
Let me put in the other link.

940
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,640
There we go. It's been edited now.

941
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,760
So you can just save that. That's kind of cool.

942
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,120
And get going with that one.

943
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,400
Yeah, it's why the rank and rent digital real estate model is broken.

944
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,960
Not sure where you're going with that, Nick.

945
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,800
But I will definitely give it a listen.

946
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,640
Yeah, it's it's click bait.

947
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,560
But I follow. I actually come through on the click bait for real.

948
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,320
It makes sense when you listen to it.

949
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,640
So any other questions?

950
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,520
So Kirk just says he has a not now.

951
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,320
Pause the ads was thinking of finding a new bio.

952
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,960
He's asking if you should do that, Kirk.

953
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,280
Yeah, go find a new business owner.

954
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,480
You know, if somebody asks you for a lead, you say not now.

955
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,080
Do you think they want to continue work with you down the road?

956
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:04,200
Probably not. Yeah, so I agree.

957
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,600
And not now.

958
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,280
Again, I've talked about this.

959
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,400
I've trained about this in digital landlords, guys.

960
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,360
We it's we think that it's like we go to a city and it's yes or no.

961
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,960
Right. It's not.

962
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,120
It's yes or not now, maybe later.

963
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,080
And I view it like an entire city like that.

964
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,240
So if I'm looking, if I'm working Las Vegas, I'm working Los Angeles,

965
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,240
which would be terrible to work.

966
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,160
But I'm going to use that in Phoenix. Right.

967
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,840
I might be working those areas and I might find out that like,

968
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,240
you know, dude,

969
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,440
Las Vegas right now, it's just it's a it's a weird time of year.

970
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,880
And I'm just not getting any traction.

971
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,680
And so I'm not going to quit on the area because I've done all the homework.

972
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,480
I know that's a good area.

973
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,560
But I am going to pause it and go look at other stuff

974
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,320
and maybe try to get a deal in L.A., try to get a deal in Phoenix.

975
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,920
Then I'll come back to it and come back with a fresh set of eyes.

976
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,360
Some new confidence, a new maybe another case study, whatever the case is.

977
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,600
Got it. OK.

978
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,360
Nadine says, Nick, I sent a guy leads this morning.

979
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,920
He seems keen. When do I follow up?

980
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,200
Nadine, are you is she in does that name?

981
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,640
Is she in digital landlords or she not?

982
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,120
I can check. It doesn't sound familiar.

983
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,200
You know.

984
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,440
It does sound familiar.

985
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,240
Nadine, are you in digital landlords?

986
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,400
Because if you are, I'm going to just refer you to a module

987
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,760
which will answer every single one of your questions in two seconds.

988
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,760
Well, we'll see what you answer.

989
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,320
Let's see another. Well, I get that.

990
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,240
Yeah, I don't know if you want to answer for the group still.

991
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,560
Just a quick synopsis summary.

992
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,400
So Nadine's not in deal.

993
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,560
Oh, OK. So just in the free group, then.

994
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,440
So a little summary, Nick.

995
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,440
Yeah, you want to, you're saying?

996
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,800
Yeah, you got it. You want to do that?

997
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,960
Yeah, you do it for the group.

998
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,040
Yeah, this would be the last thing that I'll answer, guys, is.

999
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,280
So it's again, it's an art.

1000
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:06,560
It's it's first of all, when you say follow up, this is this is tough, right?

1001
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,680
Like we're not talking face to face, but like you mean follow up?

1002
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,440
Are you just sending it?

1003
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,560
Because I'm I'm live transfer in all my leads.

1004
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,640
So like I'm never not following up from the time that I call you.

1005
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,040
Dude, I'm I'm freaking me and you are buds.

1006
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,560
I'm calling you. I'm texting you.

1007
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,360
I'm not being annoying.

1008
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,800
I mean, every time I call you, you're going to you're going to salivate.

1009
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,320
You know, I got leads, but you're going to be talking to me a lot.

1010
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,400
I'm going to be sending you live transfers.

1011
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,040
I'm going to be fine. Did you get that one scheduled?

1012
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,080
Did you get that one hooked? Hey, can I call you?

1013
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,600
Like me and you are like, I'm sending these free jobs.

1014
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,360
They're lit. They're they're digital gold.

1015
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,800
I'm not just going to send them and forget.

1016
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,320
So the answer, if you haven't talked to him, was yesterday.

1017
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,280
You're talking to this person.

1018
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,520
You're like you are trying to get this deal

1019
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,200
from the second you call until the second you close.

1020
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,520
So I don't know what you mean when you say how soon to follow up.

1021
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,440
Like you don't ever stop following up.

1022
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,880
You're in constant contact until you get the deal.

1023
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,080
That's the reality. OK.

1024
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,560
Now, when to go for the close.

1025
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,160
That's another art thing.

1026
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,120
We teach that as I did to landlords to a T.

1027
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:14,280
It's it's also something that you learn and it's there's not an exact answer.

1028
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,800
But we have some criteria that we follow as well.

1029
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,920
So maybe let's answer one more question if there is one.

1030
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,080
Are we good? I think we're good.

1031
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,560
Beautiful. Guys, thank you for being on the call.

1032
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,920
I appreciate you guys being on the call.

1033
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,760
I think we had 20 people, 18 people.

1034
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,760
And I I really do enjoy doing these.

1035
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,920
I don't care, to be honest with you, if there's two.

1036
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,040
Last week, it really frustrated me.

1037
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,200
There was two people and it was a Labor Day.

1038
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,160
So I told the people that were on, I would make sure to hook them up

1039
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,520
and we would run it with more people.

1040
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:51,600
But like I love having 18 people that really want to try.

1041
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,080
They really want to do this now to speak to a couple of you guys

1042
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,880
that I keep seeing your face again and again and again.

1043
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,400
I guess I'm going to ask you, like, what's it going to take for something to change?

1044
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,160
Right. Like Jason's on this call.

1045
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,280
He's at over thirteen thousand dollars a month right now.

1046
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,400
He started in January. I've been seeing some of you guys for way longer

1047
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,720
than I've known Jason.

1048
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,120
And you're still doing nothing.

1049
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:18,240
You're still refusing to to either take your own, you know, your own action,

1050
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,440
spend your own money and pay the piper.

1051
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,840
But you also don't want to spend money.

1052
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,080
So I don't understand what you think.

1053
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,320
Like, do you think that you're just going to wake up

1054
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,400
and you're just going to get this business dropped to your lap

1055
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,720
that's making you, you know, fifteen, twenty thousand bucks a month?

1056
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,320
You're not going to have to work. You're not going to have to suffer.

1057
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,840
You're not going to spend any money. You don't have to take it.

1058
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,280
Like, I just don't get it.

1059
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,880
So there's a couple of you I keep seeing you.

1060
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,080
And I love you to death. But for the love,

1061
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,840
let's go do something with the knowledge.

1062
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,000
Let's quit taking notes and let's go do.

1063
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,920
Like, if you're going to choose the path, you have two paths to choose.

1064
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,560
Go spend your own money or pay me and get in my program.

1065
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,760
That's your two paths.

1066
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,440
OK, go spend your own money. Do it today.

1067
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,280
And it's a win-win for me, because if you spend it today,

1068
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,960
you're going to realize that, holy crap, I just spent a thousand bucks.

1069
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,160
I could have just, you know, gone into Nick's program.

1070
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,040
I could have paid, you know, started getting into it.

1071
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,920
Like, and if you don't, then you're going to get all the information.

1072
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:15,320
So whatever it is, guys, just start, just start.

1073
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,280
Go spend some money.

1074
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,720
And so you actually see that this isn't as easy as you think it is,

1075
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,520
but it's also not as complicated as you think it is.

1076
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,560
OK, and that's just for the people I keep seeing.

1077
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,600
I love you guys showing up.

1078
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,960
But like I said at the beginning, if you don't change anything,

1079
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,640
nothing's going to change.

1080
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,160
OK, so let's stop getting on these calls and doing nothing.

1081
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,720
And I'm going to start.

1082
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,960
Aaron, do we have a way to tracking who's on these calls?

1083
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,800
Do we have any kind of a thing that shows us in the past

1084
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,080
who's been on these calls?

1085
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,560
I wouldn't know unless we just manually check the live recordings,

1086
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,280
which we could do.

1087
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,160
And we might do that.

1088
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,240
I would love to see.

1089
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,360
And I'm going to start being like, you can get on like three.

1090
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,400
And then if you don't have a deal, I'm kicking you out of the entire group

1091
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,160
and blocking you from anything I ever create,

1092
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,840
because that's time, or at least show me you've spent some money on ads.

1093
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,120
At least some of you doing something.

1094
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,520
You know what I mean?

1095
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,400
That's what I think. OK, guys, thanks for being on the call.

1096
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,680
It's a beautiful September 9th.

1097
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,440
Live in the laptop lifestyle.

1098
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,720
We got we got we got people from Aaron.

1099
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,200
Tell these guys where you're at.

1100
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,160
I'm in Virginia.

1101
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,560
No, what city? It's it's it's.

1102
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,600
What's it called? Colonial Heights, Colonial Heights.

1103
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:26,560
I'm going to do a couple of projects, digital real estate in that area today.

1104
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,200
Just right in Aaron's backyard, just for fun.

1105
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,080
Just kidding. Jason is in.

1106
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:35,080
Are you in Lehigh, Jason, Lehigh, Utah?

1107
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,320
Southern Utah County.

1108
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,920
Basically the same place.

1109
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,400
OK, Utah County. OK, beautiful.

1110
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,760
And I am in Dubai.

1111
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,640
And there's people all over the world.

1112
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,800
And guess what? That's the beauty of the laptop lifestyle.

1113
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,640
So, guys, thanks for being on the call.

1114
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,080
Grab those resources.

1115
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,160
We'll see you next week. Thanks, guys.
