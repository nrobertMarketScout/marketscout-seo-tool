00:00.000 --> 00:01.040
You're overthinking everything.

00:01.040 --> 00:03.840
He says, I guess it's the GMB that throws me for a loop.

00:04.720 --> 00:05.360
Why does that?

00:05.360 --> 00:06.160
And you don't have to answer this.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.240
This is a rhetorical question for everybody.

00:08.240 --> 00:11.680
I have not lost a second of sleep over a GMB, guys.

00:11.680 --> 00:14.080
There's three ways to get leads on Google.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.480
There's paid ads, there's the Google My Business,

00:16.480 --> 00:18.160
AKA the Maps, and there's organic.

00:18.880 --> 00:19.440
Guess what?

00:20.080 --> 00:22.240
99% of the people out there

00:22.240 --> 00:23.920
don't know how to run Google Ads.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.440
All the people doing rank and rent

00:25.440 --> 00:26.560
don't know how to run Google Ads.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.440
So guess what?

00:27.440 --> 00:30.480
Their only chance is organic and maps.

00:30.480 --> 00:31.440
And guess what?

00:31.440 --> 00:32.800
Maps just got taken.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.000
So they have one.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.640
And when I say taken, there's still ways to get ranked,

00:36.640 --> 00:38.640
or there's still ways to get verified, obviously,

00:38.640 --> 00:40.000
but it's not as easy as it was

00:40.000 --> 00:42.080
where you just throw it up and it goes.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.520
They only have one way to get leads, right?

00:46.720 --> 00:47.280
Guess what?

00:48.160 --> 00:50.640
It may not be as easy for us to get the GMB,

00:51.520 --> 00:53.040
but we still have ads.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.160
We still have organic.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.240
So that's why I'm saying focus on

00:56.240 --> 00:58.000
how competitive is the organic?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.920
Because if you can get ranked organically

00:59.920 --> 01:01.840
and you can get the ads to supplement,

01:02.480 --> 01:04.240
you will be fine.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.960
In 2020, I don't know how many projects I had

01:06.960 --> 01:08.800
by the time I was making 100K,

01:08.800 --> 01:12.240
but I will tell you that more than half of those

01:12.240 --> 01:14.560
did not have a verified GMB.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.080
We were making money.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.640
We had contracts that business owners were happy

01:18.640 --> 01:21.840
strictly on ads and organic.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.960
And a lot of the organic was taking a while to catch up.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.760
So guys, stop stressing about that.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.720
Don't give up on it.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.400
Not saying to stop trying to figure out ways

01:32.400 --> 01:33.840
that are ethical, that are white hat,

01:34.880 --> 01:36.240
that are above board,

01:37.120 --> 01:39.040
but don't sweat it.

01:40.240 --> 01:44.400
I've never even lost a second of sleep on this whole,

01:44.400 --> 01:46.560
everyone's in their freaking pants about this.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.680
Like, what are we going to do?

01:47.680 --> 01:48.240
What are we going to do?

01:48.240 --> 01:50.320
Just quit stressing, okay?

01:50.320 --> 01:51.360
And I know that's hard

01:51.360 --> 01:52.960
because I'm a stressor when certain areas,

01:52.960 --> 01:54.320
but I'm just telling you for this,

01:54.320 --> 01:55.760
don't stress, okay?
