1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
All right.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We should be live.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hey, guys.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let me know if you're here.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If you can hear me, drop a comment.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We're going to go into this live as soon as I get someone up here.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Look alive.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Look alive.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Make sure there's sound.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I also need to record this.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And then I got another student who's trailblazing, guys.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Someone who just broke through.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I have to show you that Christmas and Thanksgiving is no excuse.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's a good time, but it's no excuse to put the foot on the brakes.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I think we're good.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let me just check the sound here and we can rock.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:35,000
There we go.

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
All right.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We got someone.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
All right.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's 10 o'clock.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's go.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
All right, guys.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So let me get Morgan in here because he's got stuff to share that you

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
guys can definitely relate to.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And as he's telling his story and, you know,

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
laying it out, you guys, please drop some comments.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you have any questions, this is a good time to ask questions.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
All right.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let me go ahead and get Morgan in.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All right.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Morgan, can you hear me?

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, I can.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Awesome.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm using the mic this time.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Cause I got a couple of questions.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm using the mic this time.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Cause I got actually a message from one of the people in the group saying

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
that the only thing that they didn't like is the,

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
the quality of the voice.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Cause I was just using the microphone on the, on the camera.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So I played in the actual mic.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So you guys, hopefully you can hear me in.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
HD now.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I guess.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Cool. Morgan.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I appreciate you making the time to jump on.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So for those who don't know who Morgan is,

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
tell us a little bit about your background, where you came from.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And how do you find yourself here?

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah. So actually it's funny.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I, I went to the military to be a special operations.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Combatitive.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And I washed out on a medical injury.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Then I got lucky enough to get into the military.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And then I got into the military.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And then I got into the military.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And then I got lucky enough to get stationed in Hawaii.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And even though I was in this wonderland, I,

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I want it more for myself. I felt like this isn't enough.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I need to figure out what's next.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So I saw this guy walking around the barracks and he was always just

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
looking so dapper.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He had a dress shirt, dress pants, a tie, just looking real fresh.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So I ended up going to him and being like, Hey man, what are you,

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
what are you getting into?

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What's your reason for dressing like this?

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Cause all the rest of us are just young people clocking into work,

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
coming home and figuring out what we're going to do with the rest of our

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
day.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Long story short.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He introduced me into this world of entrepreneurship,

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
but he was operating in an MLM.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And once I got wind that it was something kind of fishy,

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I did a bunch of research.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And in one of the breakdowns,

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I found a link to rank and rent.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And then that's how I hopped on and I made my commitment right away to

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
start giving myself to this business model fully.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And that's exactly how I made my exit plan from the air force.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
How much did you spend in the air force?

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I spent four years active duty in the air force.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And then I just cut ties.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I've never been a big fan of authority,

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
but you have to learn to follow before you can learn to lead.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Good point.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So you did that.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And then you,

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
you discovered MLM and it was kind of up your alley,

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
but not so much not.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You wanted something that's MLM,

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
but better than MLM,

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
like a little bit more upside and you found rank and rent and you're like,

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, this is better than multi-level marketing.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What drew you specifically to it?

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Like when you watch these Nick videos, like what, what was it,

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
what was about it?

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So to answer your first question as well,

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I just didn't want to build my success off of other people's failure.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And that really is what MLM comes down to.

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
There is a very,

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
very small percentage of successful people in that.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So all the people you're bringing on likely will fail.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And what attracted me to the rank and rent model and to,

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
to Nick, I got into the rank and rent model before Nick,

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
but whenever I was introduced to Nick,

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I took it from two to 3000 all the way up to 13 was my highest month that I

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
saw.

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And it was just helping people, man,

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
helping people put bread on their table. And then I get it.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I get a slice of that bread, you know, for me, it's always been, if I,

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
if I'm not building my riches off of helping others to some capacity,

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
if I can't at least tell myself that not everyone else has to feel the same,

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
but if I at least can't tell myself that then I'm doing something wrong.

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I like it. Yeah.

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The, I heard this just the other day.

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The right thing to do is always the right thing to do.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah. And when it feels right, like, yeah, no, yeah.

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
When you've got, we talked about gut too, like that gut feeling.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When you don't feel it. I mean, you had this high, I mean,

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
the force or the air force is as high and persistent as it gets,

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
but still you found yourself in there, but it didn't click with you.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It didn't jive with you. So you wanted something better,

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
even though everyone that's in the air force was probably like, yeah,

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
this is it. This is, you know, as good as it gets, you know,

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
but you were still, you know, striving. Now, tell me about the two to three K.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What year was that as opposed to the 13 K per month, which is your peak,

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
right? Maximum that you got is 13. Okay. So what, what years were those?

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So two to three K,

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I want to say that was about a year and a half, two years in.

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And what is that like 2022?

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, no, no, no.

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It was either 2020 or 2021.

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And I'm sure we'll get to it a little bit later,

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
but I had a lot of shiny object syndrome in my time.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So, yeah, I want to say it was about one in 2020, 2021.

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It was right around beginning of COVID time where I started to really draw

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
in some money from that and then started to develop my exit plan.

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
As I started to count some of my eggs before they hatched,

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
because I just knew that staying under that umbrella of authority wasn't what

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I wanted to do.

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And I believe that you can be under an umbrella of authority and still find

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
freedom. But for me, it just wasn't happening.

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah. Yeah. It's just, that's your character. That's who you are.

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah. And I like also that you phased out.

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I did the same thing. I had a full-time job. And then when I started this,

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I went into part-time and hired someone and then switched,

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
trained them to do what I do, gave them the full-time, took the part-time.

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And then three months later, I just phased out until instead of just pulling the

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
plug and going full board, that's a little scary.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Easing into it is the way to go.

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And a lot of students are actually doing that in the group.

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
They have full-time jobs, full-time parents, bad asses,

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and they also carve out time to go work on this, the rank and rent.

157
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That way they're easing off of the work.

158
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They're phasing out and then going full-time into rank and rent.

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah, I like it.

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
13K, obviously got some shiny objects in your way, some rabbit holes.

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We all do. I still do.

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I just got two companies yesterday reaching out to me to build big websites.

163
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So that's going to be a rabbit hole.

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So it's my focus now to make sure that my team is self-sufficient.

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't have to touch those websites. I don't have to think about them or anything.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So yeah, it is an ongoing thing.

167
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And if you think that you've passed it, you are mistaken.

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's going to come again and again and again.

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Because the more you gain experience, the more people put you on a pedestal,

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
the more you deliver to people, the more they believe in you and they give you other things.

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Like, oh, you're great at rank and rent.

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Can you do my social? Can you do this?

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And you start throwing things at you.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I mean, it's your job, sure, to take care of those people, make that green, make that money,

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
but without sacrificing your time and your focus for rank and rent.

176
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Because that's what happened.

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I get pulled into a project and then I wake up like three months later.

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Like, what happened?

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I made some money with that website and SEO, but there goes three months.

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I didn't touch any rank and rent in three months.

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So what was your situation, Morgan?

182
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
How did you get distracted?

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So actually, right away, I don't know why I felt like I needed someone to be there by my side.

184
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You know, who knows?

185
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Who knows?

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
In my younger years, maybe I was subconsciously lonely.

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Maybe I just wanted someone to be big with.

188
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But when I left the military, I called up one of my buddies and he was making money.

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He was making money.

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Go ahead.

191
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He was making money in a not so enriching way, but had a lot of entrepreneurial experience.

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So I asked him if he wanted to come on as a partner.

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Obviously, he wouldn't get any of the profitability of what I've already accomplished.

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But if he helps me to do these new sites and things like that.

195
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So we gave it a shot for a while and he made a little bit of money, but it really didn't work.

196
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And then we separated and we made what's called state of mind labs.

197
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And we were doing hemp, just basically hemp wholesale to various countries,

198
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
mostly Japan, Australia, Denmark, Ireland, a lot of different areas like that.

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Like for fabric and rope and stuff?

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Distillates and isolates.

201
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So actually compounds that they could consume.

202
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And I stayed on top of my marketing as well and got up to 13K, had a lot of 10K, 11K, 12K months.

203
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And then state of mind labs started to show this potential of making lots and lots of money.

204
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So little by little, more and more of my attention started to shift.

205
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And at that point in time, I still didn't have a full time team around me like I do now.

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So it was a lot of work that just wasn't getting done the way it used to.

207
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And then after state of mind labs, I created another company called Ion Solar.

208
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And this was to do with me creating customer flow.

209
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And then I had three other partners and their jobs were manufacturing equipment

210
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and creating that culture for the sales reps to go out and close these deals.

211
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Great concept, but I took a lot of people on that had no experience whatsoever.

212
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And they were really in that blue collar, nine to five mindset.

213
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So it was really hard to keep accountability for everyone.

214
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That was one that didn't last long, but took a lot of my funds.

215
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And then I saw my marketing company coming down from those big numbers

216
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and hitting lows as low as $3,500 per month.

217
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And my savings were just getting eaten into.

218
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So we closed down Ion Solar.

219
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And then we opened up another company called Shenzhen Sales Ventures.

220
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And we opened this one up because we saw that state of mind labs was dying.

221
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The wholesale industry was getting too competitive

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
because manufacturers were figuring out how to get that same visibility

223
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
that the brokers like ourselves were getting.

224
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So we weren't really able to middleman as efficiently.

225
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So we were like, okay, well, now we know how to build a sales organization.

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So let's go into the retail space and we can just broker for all these other companies.

227
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
We did that for a while, but we found out that even though we were running up the commissions

228
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
super high for our people and they would just be making aggressively good money,

229
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
whenever you don't pay that base salary, you really can't hold them accountable either.

230
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So it just became a lot of accountability.

231
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And I just couldn't figure out how to hold all these other people accountable

232
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
in these other business models.

233
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So then I came back.

234
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I told my partner, I said, hey, look, I don't want a partnership with this.

235
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I took a lot of the heavy load.

236
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So I want you to get me back this much, but the company's yours.

237
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Keep it.

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And I'm shutting down all the other ones except for my marketing company.

239
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm going to go back to my roots.

240
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So that was about two years, two years of being completely off track

241
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
from when I had hit 13K and then I had to start building back up.

242
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I had a couple of $3,000 a month, $3,500 a month, which just was not cutting it,

243
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
not when that is your primary source of income.

244
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So what I did was I moved back home to get a big reset.

245
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And it's been the best thing I possibly could have done.

246
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I've been away from family for seven years.

247
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I come back and I'm enriching those relationships again.

248
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I got back up to $10,000 a month during these holidays.

249
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
October was my $10,000 month.

250
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
These holidays, November, December, $7,500.

251
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But I'm actually pretty happy with that because I didn't lose any clientele.

252
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Some websites during the holidays will still get leads and some will get zero.

253
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Absolutely nothing.

254
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And just me in the goodness of my heart,

255
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I know everyone runs their rank and rent a little bit different,

256
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
but I can't charge someone during the holidays

257
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and not have them put gifts on their family's table.

258
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's just not in me.

259
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And I know other people aren't always the same and I don't judge those people.

260
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Everyone has the right to make their own decisions in this life.

261
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But now I came to the conclusion that I have no interest

262
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
in building any partnerships with anyone

263
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
because in this business model, you really don't need anyone.

264
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You don't need anyone else except for yourself.

265
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And as far as the shiny object syndrome,

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I've got a lot of other business models with low-hanging fruit

267
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
that I'm just pushing off, but there is one thing I am working on.

268
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And what's so cool about it is it plays directly into what I'm already doing,

269
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
which is SEO.

270
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And that is targeting luxury real estate in certain areas of the country

271
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
so that all I have to do,

272
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't have to go out and hunt for my own people to sell their homes

273
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
or to go and find them to buy homes.

274
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And it's in a luxury market,

275
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
so the dollar is going to go a lot further for those commissions.

276
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But every day I can just wake up, work on my marketing,

277
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
have my secretary handle all of my customer flow for my real estate stuff.

278
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And if I have to go do a meeting, okay,

279
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
put my team to work for the day, make sure everything's going smoothly.

280
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And that's it, man.

281
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's my vision for the future.

282
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I feel like I just didn't know how to manage in the past.

283
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And you always think you can do more than you can in the short term,

284
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and you always underestimate what you can get done in the long term.

285
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And those are wise words, man.

286
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I definitely agree with you,

287
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
but I also want to commend you for being entrepreneur ballsy, okay?

288
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Because not everyone can just get up and say,

289
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
hey, I'm going to start a solar company.

290
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And you look like you're in your early 20s, right?

291
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Mid-20s?

292
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
27.

293
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
27.

294
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I mean, yeah, mid-20s.

295
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I mean, that's the age where you need to be ballsy and go all out

296
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and try different things, absolutely.

297
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But in your advantage, you matured early, you made mistakes early,

298
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and you found yourself back.

299
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
There's nothing wrong with being entrepreneurial,

300
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
but it's like a later step.

301
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's like a phase three or phase four after you've mastered this,

302
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
after you've built your cash, after you've built your assets.

303
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You're like, okay, everything looks good.

304
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Time to jump into, take this cash and go invest it somewhere else.

305
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah, I mean, your head is in the right direction.

306
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I think you were just a little early.

307
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I was early.

308
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I shouldn't have jumped.

309
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Too much too early, right?

310
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Too much too early.

311
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You're so right, man.

312
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And a lot of people say don't do business with family,

313
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
but I always thought if you can't trust family, then who can you trust?

314
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Or friends, if you can't trust friends, then who can you trust?

315
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But at the same time, one thing I had to learn was

316
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
you can't just turn these people into what you want them to be.

317
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
They already have to be those people.

318
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And yeah, if I wouldn't have jumped ship so early,

319
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm sure I would have had a lot more patience.

320
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And I was always looking for different opportunities,

321
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
but I should have mastered this model first.

322
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And now that's exactly what I'm doing.

323
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So 13K, that's going to be blown out of the water in 2025.

324
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I have a minimal standard of 15,

325
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and I'm really aiming up for 20 before the end of this year.

326
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And then obviously with the real estate stuff on the side,

327
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
that'll add in some fat paydays as well.

328
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So we're on the right track now, 100%.

329
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But yeah, definitely jumped ship a little too early.

330
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
If you think that it's the right time,

331
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
weigh out the pros and cons because I was just excited, man.

332
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And that excitement can bite you in the butt sometimes.

333
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I almost jumped into swag.

334
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I almost started selling swag.

335
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Actually, Nick did. Nick jumped on it, and I didn't.

336
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And I remember him just being like, wow, that was dumb.

337
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
This was before the program, by the way.

338
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah, we made mistakes too.

339
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Nick got into swag.

340
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
He would make promotional items, and there's a site,

341
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
and you order them, and they go straight to the customer.

342
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I was about to jump on it, and then he was complaining.

343
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I was like, you know what?

344
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm going to go back and get out of this rabbit hole

345
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and go back to my track.

346
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So yeah, we've all been there.

347
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
We've all went into those rabbit holes

348
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and came back with more wisdom and more maturity.

349
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Like, oh, it doesn't have to be complicated.

350
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It doesn't have to be big.

351
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It doesn't have to be elaborate.

352
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Simple and stupid sometimes pays the bills.

353
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Sometimes we get too smart for our own good.

354
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Like, oh, this is easy.

355
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I could definitely fit some more stuff.

356
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Let me go look, see what else I can do.

357
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
No, no, no.

358
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Just take the same wheel that's turning

359
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and just spin it faster and faster and faster.

360
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And then once it starts to wobble, add another wheel,

361
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
turn that faster, and then you keep adding those wheels

362
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
instead of going and finding other stuff.

363
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
There's something in a book that I read,

364
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and the book is called The Way of the Superior Man,

365
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
and this can apply to women as well,

366
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
maybe not the whole entirety of the book,

367
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
but the concept is living on your edge, right?

368
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And when you live on your edge,

369
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
you want to be right over your edge, right?

370
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Because if you go too far over your edge,

371
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
you're going to be spread too thin.

372
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And if you're not on your edge at all,

373
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
you're in the level of comfort.

374
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You're in the zone of comfort,

375
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
and you're not going to grow at all.

376
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So just pushing yourself just right over that edge,

377
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
where it's a little uncomfortable, but it's manageable,

378
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and you can flow, and you can just find your rhythm.

379
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
That's where you want to be.

380
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yep, absolutely.

381
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And putting people in the right place.

382
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I think that's instrumental too,

383
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
because you can stick to one...

384
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You have a really good point.

385
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah, you stick to one thing,

386
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
but then as you rinse into repeating,

387
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
you hit capacity at one point.

388
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And it's like you're going 120 miles an hour,

389
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and then once you hit 140 miles an hour,

390
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
your steering wheel starts to shake.

391
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And that's when you're like,

392
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
oh, okay, I need to hire someone.

393
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm going to start offloading.

394
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That's your sign to start offloading.

395
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And you mentioned something important earlier,

396
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
where you delegate the things that you've already mastered.

397
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And Nick has hammered on this point before.

398
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Like in your case, you've got a secretary,

399
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
and anything that doesn't have value,

400
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
like a task that doesn't have a lot of value,

401
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
you pass it on, and you just keep the high-value tasks.

402
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And then even those high-value tasks,

403
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
once you master them, you get an expert to push those on.

404
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Like I stopped building websites,

405
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I stopped doing social, I stopped doing all the technical stuff.

406
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I used to do all of it, and it sucked,

407
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
because I was my own bottleneck.

408
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The work was slow because of me.

409
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
The minute I got an expert in each thing,

410
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
content manager, web developer,

411
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
they're doing a much better job than I did.

412
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And now the wheels are turning faster and faster.

413
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So yes, sometimes we are our own bottlenecks.

414
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And that could be another thing to touch on too,

415
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
is you have to know when it is the right time

416
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
to start delegating that work,

417
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
because I have always been such an excitable person,

418
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
and I feel like now I can be a lot more serious,

419
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and I can weigh out pros and cons a lot more efficiently

420
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
because of all those failures

421
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
that have allowed me to be more successful.

422
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That was another one I did.

423
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I hired too much too early on,

424
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
and now I feel I found that perfect balance

425
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
that allows me to grow,

426
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
that allows me to just spread everything out

427
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
in a more strategic manner while still keeping me busy,

428
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
because there were times where I hired too much,

429
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
and it's like, all right, what am I even supposed

430
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
to be doing right now?

431
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You know, so that's definitely another thing to consider.

432
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Nice. Tell me about this team.

433
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
How did you hire the first member of your team?

434
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The first member of my team was just all-inclusive SEO,

435
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
and I felt like my on-page was really strong,

436
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
but my off-page is what I always wanted to master.

437
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I feel like off-page is harder for most people.

438
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
So I hired someone that was really good off-page,

439
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and she manages everything as far as backlinking,

440
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
contact, outreach.

441
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
She manages our content writers and our blog strategies

442
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
and our interlinking.

443
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So she started with just off-page,

444
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and then she evolved into doing a lot of other things

445
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
as well, interlinking.

446
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Project manager, then. It's kind of a project manager.

447
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yeah, for sure.

448
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
She's really evolved into her role,

449
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and she's definitely the most independent

450
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
of all of my people.

451
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So sometimes she's a little harder to get through

452
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
than the others, but that's kind of what you need, right?

453
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
If you're going to look for a leader,

454
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
you need someone who's going to be a little more independent,

455
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
who's going to be able to take things into their own hand

456
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and to just move forward.

457
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
One of my greatest additions, however, I feel,

458
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
was my Google Business Profile Manager.

459
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
She is an absolute rock star.

460
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I don't understand how she gets as much done

461
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
as she does in time.

462
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I use Hubstaff, and she's busy 90% of the time.

463
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Her screen's just moving.

464
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And she actually turned out to have some hidden talents

465
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
as well with graphic design.

466
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So now she'll do designs for the website,

467
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
even though she's only ever done graphic designs

468
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
for different posters and different posts

469
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and content for social media.

470
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But it turns out she has a knack for web design as well.

471
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So she's been an amazing addition.

472
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I do keep content writers on hand for off-page SEO

473
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and for our on-page strategies as well.

474
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And I had a web developer, man, but you know what?

475
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I kind of like it.

476
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I kind of enjoy it.

477
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I can cut on a podcast,

478
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
something that's interesting to me.

479
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And I can just develop my websites.

480
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I kind of got a little spoiled to that.

481
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm sure there will come a point

482
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
where I become too busy to do that.

483
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But right now, that's all I do is sales and development.

484
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And everything else is outsourced.

485
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Sales and development.

486
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I see you outsourcing the development

487
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and keeping the sales.

488
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Once your sales becomes overwhelming,

489
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
yeah, I see you definitely passing the development over.

490
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I do too.

491
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I had tried it, but I didn't like it.

492
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I have had, that is such a hard thing to find,

493
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
is a good developer.

494
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I can't tell you how many developers I've collaborated with

495
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
since I've gotten into this business model,

496
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and I might have had one out of 10 good experiences.

497
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Really, I've had amazing developers.

498
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Hit me up, I'll help you.

499
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'll find you a rock star.

500
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Yeah, I've been especially lucky with web developers.

501
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Sales, not so much.

502
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I've failed so many times in finding salespeople.

503
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Commission only.

504
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I mean, yeah, you can find the base pay everywhere.

505
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
They just get paid and do office work.

506
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
But I wanted a closer that can just work off commission

507
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and just hit them like whack-a-mole, right?

508
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I did not find them.

509
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I hired and fired and hired and fired.

510
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But the web developers, I can hook you up.

511
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
That's easy.

512
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I actually got them from online, jobs.ph.

513
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
That's the sign-up for them.

514
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
That's what I prefer as well.

515
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah, and the developers that I have are amazing.

516
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Like you said, they have hidden talents.

517
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So you get a developer and they already have a background in IT.

518
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Heck yeah, IT.

519
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I want someone who knows IT because we have server issues.

520
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
We have all kinds of stuff.

521
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah, I'll take IT all day.

522
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
They have SEO backgrounds.

523
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I love that.

524
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But you've got to set the parameters.

525
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's tricky because SEO is an ocean, right?

526
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's like the Pacific Ocean.

527
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And the SEO that we do is like just the island of Hawaii.

528
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
We do a very specific type of SEO that is white hacks, not spamming.

529
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You can do all kinds of SEO.

530
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So it is important if you're bringing an SEO person to set parameters for them.

531
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Here's a due diligence sheet.

532
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Here's how we survey, how we do the find the low-hanging fruit.

533
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Here's how we do this.

534
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Here's how we do this.

535
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
That way you narrow down what they're working with and they're not sabotaging your stuff.

536
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Not intentionally, of course, but they might sabotage your stuff.

537
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
They might sabotage your stuff unintentionally by doing things that they think are right or white hat.

538
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I like that.

539
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Black hat's going to become extinct.

540
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
What's that?

541
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Black hat will become extinct.

542
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yes.

543
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Yeah.

544
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I mean, yeah, all the platforms now in search engines have AI and they're cracking down hard.

545
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It worked when I first got in.

546
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And I know it worked for people even more before I got in.

547
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But man, white hats, when there's Google updates now, I look forward to them because my site.

548
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah.

549
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You're waiting for them to wash out.

550
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Yeah.

551
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Exactly.

552
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Yeah.

553
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah.

554
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
That's awesome, man.

555
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So tell me about.

556
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So right now you have this rock star person that's like organizing your life basically, which I find myself in the same same situation.

557
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I have an amazing project manager, an amazing team, but especially an amazing project manager.

558
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Because like you said, I don't have she's very intuitive.

559
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
She knows me.

560
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
She knows what decisions I'm going to make before I make them.

561
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And she goes and makes them on my behalf.

562
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
She goes and answers emails and deals with customers and all that stuff.

563
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So I'm free to do the business development before I struggled.

564
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I did the dance.

565
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You know, the prospect fulfill prospects fulfill.

566
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And you're running around.

567
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
If you're fulfilling, you're not selling.

568
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And once you're done with the fulfillment, you're like, oh, my gosh, back to sales.

569
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
My sales are dropping.

570
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And then you go start selling, selling, selling, selling.

571
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And then you're like, oh, I got a couple of accounts.

572
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You go manage them.

573
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And then you constantly back and forth instead of sticking with sales and whatever you're selling, you're throwing over to your team.

574
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And you're still in sales.

575
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You're focusing. You're not running back and forth between fulfillment and sales.

576
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So, yeah, it took some time, but I think I'm 95% out of fulfillment.

577
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I still have my hands a little dirty, but that's the plan because I'm realizing that that is what affects sales.

578
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
It's going and doing the fulfillment.

579
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Now I am the face of the company.

580
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
That's who people buy from.

581
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
They buy from me, not from my company.

582
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So I have to show my face.

583
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I have to be looped in on the emails.

584
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I have to do certain things.

585
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But I'm working on removing myself because I'm not adding anything that's of value.

586
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I sell and my team takes care of everything, and they do it better than I do.

587
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So why would I be in the way?

588
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Why would I, you know, jump in there?

589
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I hear that.

590
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,000
My hands are definitely still a little bit dirtier than yours are as far as staying in the trenches and doing different things like that.

591
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But that's OK with me.

592
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You know, I took a lot of risks.

593
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And now I kind of did have to pay for those risks a little bit, but a lot, actually.

594
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
But that's perfectly fine because you are who you become.

595
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Like, that is your value.

596
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And that's why you always see these people, right?

597
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
They go on YouTube and they're like, oh, billionaire starts with zero dollars.

598
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
How fast can you get up to that?

599
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Right.

600
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And it's because they are not their assets at that point.

601
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
They are the person they become and the abilities that they have within them.

602
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So I'm OK being here right now because I do have that abundance of time as I make my move.

603
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:09,000
When I'm making my move at the beginning of the new year to go and to also take on the real estate stuff, then my hands will definitely be a little bit less dirty in the marketing realm.

604
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And I'll be focused on sales for homes and sales for rank and rent.

605
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And then I'll have my teams doing all support, filtering through all the nonsense that I don't need to be looking at.

606
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And that'll be all I'll be worried about is just interacting with my clientele.

607
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And that's what I love. I'm a big people's person.

608
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm super extroverted.

609
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
If I see you and you interest me, you better run because I'm going to talk to you.

610
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I like that.

611
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And you're mixing physical real estate and there's a little real estate.

612
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So you still still have the entrepreneurial bug, but at least it's manageable.

613
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It's extremely manageable whenever you're not, you know, giving all of your attention to this and that.

614
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You know, if you have a secretary to qualify your leads on the real estate side, I don't I don't foresee it being any sort of an issue.

615
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
The issue is always that I was trying to just hit grand slams all the time.

616
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You know, so I do have a little bit of the bug, but I've actually seen a lot of people do this on a smaller scale and be successful with it.

617
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I am trying to do it on a larger scale with the luxury.

618
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But that also means less clientele to have to deal with.

619
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You just go to a big metro city and you're targeting all these.

620
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You're going to be running with your head cut off.

621
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But you go and you sell some 20 million dollar homes.

622
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Your commission is a year, year long salary.

623
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So that's something I'm looking forward to because it's not going to be as time demanding as, say, your normal walk of the day.

624
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Real estate agent.

625
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yep.

626
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Tell me about the rest of the team.

627
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So you've got this person who's organizing your your chaos.

628
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
What else is out there?

629
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You said there's some projects, some content writers.

630
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yes, so I have.

631
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I have a couple of content writers and one of them.

632
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
He only he'll do like enter pages if I need a new service page.

633
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Hey, Tom wants to do wallpaper as well.

634
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
He said that there's a lot of hotels looking for wallpaper.

635
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Let's get a service page out for that and let's target these keywords.

636
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I've given them a lot to work with.

637
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Like the new concept keyword cannibalization came out and that's something I had to educate them on.

638
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Hey, for our blog stuff, we don't want to confuse search engines.

639
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Let's do this.

640
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And they learn very quickly.

641
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Their ears are open to hear.

642
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And I have another guy and he'll also help with the blog strategies.

643
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But his main priority is any time we have blogs to be created for guest postings that he is immediately on that.

644
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And it people are willing to work for cheaper nowadays of a man.

645
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I prefer real content.

646
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I know you can get away with a content for a lot of stuff.

647
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And I did that for state of mind last for a while, but I prefer that real content.

648
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I don't think that AI content is penalized right now.

649
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I just think that it can sound really generic and it can be the same kind of stuff on repeat.

650
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
So I try to steer clear of that for for a lot of my stuff.

651
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And I have I have another I have Joanne.

652
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
She's amazing as well.

653
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
She does the most detail.

654
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,000
If you want to rank for something on a blog, you give her the topic and you let her run with it.

655
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Outbound links, inbound links, 2000 plus words.

656
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
She can write about anything and it's none of its filler content.

657
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
She's a superstar.

658
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
She's also got her real estate license in the Philippines.

659
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:11,000
So whenever that started up, she's going to be able to qualify people on a really intimate level to ensure that none of my time is wasted.

660
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
So, yeah, my team's been awesome and I couldn't do it without them.

661
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:26,000
They truly do give me the time to be that creative leader and to be that visionary and to continue to progress us forward.

662
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I like it. So project manager, content managers, you're still doing the development.

663
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Now, tell me, how are you going to weaponize this team for 2025?

664
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
What are you going to do that's different from from 2024?

665
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I think I think I'm just going to make an addition as far as the development.

666
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And what I really like to do now that we're actually starting to come into a flow is I would like to have more cohesiveness and more of a culture.

667
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I know with whenever I had my sales organizations, we would always do these big group Zoom meetings and things like that.

668
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And the key is to not overdo it. You know, you want your people to be at work as well.

669
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:25,000
But I think that's probably going to be that next step is going to be to get everyone on the same page together because I've been noticing like there's some information gaps here and there.

670
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And it doesn't happen often. But when it does happen, you as a leader have to be like, how can I prevent this in the future?

671
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And for me, that's that's really what I believe is going to do that.

672
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And there will also be this person on the GBP side will be like, we need to target these the most.

673
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And then this person on the SEO side will be like, we need to target these the most. And there's that there's that gap right now.

674
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:02,000
So that's probably going to be the main thing that I'll do is develop a more cohesive culture now that the team is growing and getting larger.

675
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So there's like a better flow, like less clunk in the operation, better information flow.

676
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And and everyone's the main priorities of the company overall will be a lot more clearly visible.

677
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Yep. And you're trying to hit 15 K. Is that the goal for early early 2025?

678
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
15 K is the goal for the first couple of quarters of the year.

679
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And I want to be well above 10 K sitting comfortably in the 10 K plus range in that first quarter of the new year.

680
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I didn't know you had this kind of operation. I thought maybe you had one employee. But I mean, if you have these kind of resources.

681
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Oh, yeah, it you just have to be really careful with the due diligence.

682
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
The way I do it is I do it with my SEO gal.

683
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So I would do the due diligence, come up with the idea and then pass it to her.

684
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And she does a deep dive. And then she tells me, oh, this is a yay.

685
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
This is a nay based on the parameters that I gave her, of course.

686
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So I do like an initial due diligence and then she goes and actually pulls everything.

687
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,000
The Google Trends, the AHA Trust, the Google Analytics search volume, all that stuff.

688
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And then she gives me the I tell her I need a low hanging fruit.

689
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
You can give me a big city where I can make bank, but I'm blowing a lot of money on Google.

690
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I would rather get that smaller, way smaller city that has a really good low hanging fruit, but I can get organic free leaves.

691
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
So she's smart, man. I didn't I didn't always take that route.

692
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I mean, you can go look up Dallas. I've got number one sites in Dallas.

693
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I've got number one sites in Oahu, a lot of big areas.

694
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:13,000
But with that being said, I've been in this game for so long that even though I wasn't giving it the attention it deserved, I have so much referral work now.

695
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And I have so much people that are paying me to power up these websites for them.

696
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's just it makes sense. It makes sense to do that sometimes.

697
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I play the game. Don't get me wrong. I have a site in Seattle, Washington.

698
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I have a website in Milwaukee, like some really big, big cities.

699
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:45,000
But I learned that it takes less time and effort to go to a smaller city or just a city over and break records.

700
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Like everyone's like bunched up in that city trying to get every crumb of bread.

701
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And if you just move over just 20 miles, you'll be taking everybody's lunch.

702
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And yeah, that's that's what I'm doing now. Like I'm I'm trying to take it easy.

703
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Don't go for I'm going for high niche, obscure city.

704
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Before I used to go for obscure city. Sorry. Big city, obscure niche.

705
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Now I'm flipping it. Just regular stuff that I do. Epoxy, whatever.

706
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
But I'm looking for that obscure city that everyone is asleep.

707
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:29,000
How many leads do you find you generate in your smaller cities and what kind of a population size could you give 100,000?

708
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I don't like under 100,000. It needs to be 100,000.

709
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
But, you know, when you got like two million people, that's when you're going to find big competition.

710
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So when you find, you know, two to four million, just move over to the suburbs and you'll you'll probably strike gold just in the suburbs,

711
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
which is also a back door to the big metropolitan area, the suburb itself.

712
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Like you're still collecting leads from Chicago, but you're all the way in Naperville or Batavia or the west suburbs.

713
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You're an hour away, but you're still pulling from Chicago. That's just an example, of course.

714
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yeah, but I like it, man. 15K is a great goal.

715
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I think we should set up a time for like February to, you know, have a touch point and see where you're at.

716
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
This is a great goal. It's not too hefty.

717
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And at the same time, it's because you're going to be doubling what you're making right now, right?

718
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Seventy five, eight thousand a month. So you're going to have to double that.

719
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
When you double that, it's going to feel good. It's going to catapult you to the next phases.

720
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I kind of I kind of feel more like I'm starting at 10 to after these holidays push past.

721
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That's going to bounce right back up to that number.

722
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
But nonetheless, we're at 75 right now. So you're right.

723
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
We are going to be doubling it. But I that's my complete intention.

724
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And we're going to make it happen in there. You've been there. Yeah.

725
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Yeah, you've been there. You can do it again.

726
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
The my thing this year is to focus on the hooks.

727
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And I mentioned this in other lives is if I can have four hooks a week constantly.

728
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I just closed one yesterday. So now I have three hooks today.

729
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I need to get a fourth hook because when you keep selling them or losing them.

730
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Now you just have one hook to work with.

731
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That's not enough because you might lose two clients that you closed five months ago

732
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
and now you lost two and you have one hook that might close and might not.

733
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So having four hooks for me keeps my my my head space same.

734
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And I'm not desperate. I'm in control.

735
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And I have control over the situation, not the business owners and control of my fate.

736
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I really like that. I have been in this business for over four years now.

737
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
My longest standing client, I want to say, is right around three and a half.

738
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
We're coming up on our four year mark. Nice. My shortest client a month.

739
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Right. You just you never you never know how long it's going to be.

740
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And obviously the better performing sites are going to hold it down a little bit better.

741
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But some areas get more spam and that'll just it'll just make someone so mad that they'll just drop it at some point.

742
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And what you do to try and get rid of that spam.

743
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So, yeah, you're completely correct in saying that it's like this this game is like you can find some lifers, but not everyone's going to be a lifer.

744
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Yep. Lifer is a good word. Yeah, absolutely, man.

745
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So, yeah, when you keep the numbers high on your end, you don't get desperate.

746
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
You don't you don't get scared. Fear is a big thing.

747
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And fear is smells, you know, these business owners are like tarantulas.

748
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,000
They can smell, you know, how a tarantula can like smell fear or whatever and bite you if you're freaking out.

749
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I didn't know that. Yeah, they like they smell that.

750
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
What's the hormone for fear or excitement dopamine?

751
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Skydivers. What do they get? They get that rush. Adrenaline.

752
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Adrenaline. Thank you. Yeah.

753
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Apparently, tarantulas that smell adrenaline. Yeah, guys, Google it.

754
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And I may be, you know, talking about it, but I heard it.

755
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So, yeah, business owners, they smell that, too.

756
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And they see that you're like, oh, my God, I'm freaking out.

757
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
It's Christmas and I don't have any more hooks. This is the only hook I have.

758
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I have to close it. I have I have to tell them everything and it just oozes out of you.

759
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And they're like, oh, yeah, no, thanks.

760
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But when you have four hooks, you look comfortable.

761
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
You kick back. You're like, yeah, this is my price. This is how it works.

762
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I thought you were interested in business. I thought you wanted to grow your business.

763
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And now you're throwing all this stuff at me and you don't want to move forward.

764
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
What's going on? And you're very calm and you're very collected and you're argumentative.

765
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
You're bringing solid arguments. They can't they can't compete with that.

766
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So they buy. Yeah. You get emotional or you get scared.

767
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
You lost the deal. That's right. Absolutely.

768
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Well, I appreciate you jumping on. This is really valuable, man.

769
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I took some notes and I'm definitely going to use some of the stuff that you talked about.

770
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I like the way you're structuring your team.

771
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I think that's going to be the biggest tool weaponize your team to the max

772
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
because and give them as much as you can.

773
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I always say you don't need a meeting. You just need a screencast, like just record.

774
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Every time they ask you a question, record a video for them and send it to them.

775
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,000
That's what I do. And it has been so instrumental because by the time we get to the touch point,

776
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
the weekly touch point, I've already sent them two videos.

777
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
They know what I want. They already elaborated on what I want.

778
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
They gave me even more better ideas.

779
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And yeah, every time you want to communicate with your team, send them screen recording because those stick.

780
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And if that question pops up again, here's that link. I answered it before. Here you go.

781
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And we can compile that into training. You can do so much with it.

782
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So, yeah, keep your communications through video because it's super, super instrumental.

783
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Sweet. Anything else? Let me see. There's no questions.

784
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So I hope they brought up some questions later. They're probably just Christmas shopping.

785
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Frantically Christmas shopping because it's the 18th. I hope you guys are done.

786
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:55,000
But Morgan, I appreciate you, my man. Thank you for sharing your time and these awesome nuggets today.

787
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And I will see you in the group. Yeah, thank you. I appreciate it. All right. See you guys.
