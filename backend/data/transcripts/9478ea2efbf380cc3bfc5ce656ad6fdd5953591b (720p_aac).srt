1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Okay, let's get into this guys. Welcome to the call. Obviously, we're going to be skipping

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,800
there's a few things that the some just small things that we were going to cover, but we're

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,760
not going to for time's sake. But long story short, I told you guys, I will just say this

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,560
really quick. I told you guys that we are going to be within the next two weeks going

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,400
to be talking about search volume, and we're going to be introducing the tool that we are

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,040
going to be using going forward, so that we can have a gold standard for search volume.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,920
So keep an eye out for that. Other than that, we're going to we're going to get right into

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:44,960
this with Mr. Jason. I'll read Jason. Thanks for joining us also known as Donnie Dre. And

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,400
I have got seven questions for him. I'm going to see if I get through all of them. And then

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,880
also, Aaron, if you have questions, I'm gonna let you ask and anyone else that has questions

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,680
ask as well. So let's do it. So Jason, all read. Let's start really quick. Tell everybody

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:14,760
how much you are doing per month as of today. So I'm doing 13.8 K today. Beautiful. Assuming

13
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,280
I close that other deal, which can't count the chickens before they hatch. So 13.8 K

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:30,040
today should be at 14.8 K. But you know, is that the deal that we're talking about? They

15
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,960
ghosted you? Yeah, yeah. So that one I assumed was closed for some reason. But yeah, unless

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,080
you get a payment, don't assume it's closed. That is so true. You have no idea how true

17
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:50,800
that is. So 13.8 K. When did you start? Just to give everyone a little bit of context.

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,760
I bought into your program December or November of last year. But you know, you said that

19
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,440
you really started like actually properly started in January. Like you like actually

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,360
got into this in January. Yeah, that's when I really like got my shit together. And I

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,760
was like, dude, you have to go all in this. Like, there's no reason why you should be

22
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:19,400
chasing these SEO deals. So I just went, I just went all in, in January. And yeah, that's

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,280
when I really started getting this thing going. So before that, when you were you, I remember

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,560
that you were actually you do a little bit SEO. Yeah, yeah. Got it. And that's natural.

25
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:36,040
What were you doing before? And are you still doing it? I was doing SEO, but I was doing

26
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,000
SEO for before SEO. You were doing SEO before you even joined? Yeah, I was doing SEO for

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,640
about probably five or six months before I joined your program. Okay, okay. That's exactly

28
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,320
what happened to me. And sometimes, guys, it's okay. Sometimes you got to pay the bills.

29
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,760
We understand that. But you got to be careful that you do. You don't get stuck, stuck down

30
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,920
the wormhole of SEO. What did you think? Like to you, what was the hardest, the hardest,

31
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,760
what was the biggest or the biggest challenge with running SEO company? Oh, dude, there's

32
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,520
there's so many. Um, so first of all, I had quite a few female business owners, and I'm

33
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,080
not trying to like discriminate at all. But they literally wanted me to change the look

34
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,040
of their website almost every other day. I was spending more time at the desk trying

35
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,860
to make these business owners happy with just the looks of their website, not even getting

36
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:40,500
them results. Then I was spending at my nine to five job before I quit. So I felt like

37
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,900
I kind of just had this dream of walking away from the nine to five, but I walked straight

38
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:52,100
into this other prison cell basically. And it just wasn't working out for me. Yeah, that's

39
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,420
a tricky thing to happen to me. There's nothing wrong with SEO. There's nothing wrong with

40
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:03,840
using SEO to quit your job. But like for me, it was a prison cell because I never felt

41
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,200
confident that the money was going to be there. Yeah. And we made this hilarious or not we

42
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:18,280
Isaac did. He made this hilarious like meme of like, yeah, it's, it's oh, it's not Owen

43
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,640
Wilson. It's Tom Hanks or whatever. It's like when you're at SeaWorld and your $4,000 a

44
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,000
month client quits. And I was literally at SeaWorld and on like a vacation and we're

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,440
making around eight to nine top line. One of my clients was $4,000 a month. And that

46
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,380
person called me in the middle of SeaWorld. And I just knew when I saw the phone ring

47
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:48,360
that I was toast. And man, what a what a bad experience when you're about to go on a vacation

48
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,120
paid for by the client and they're telling you they're done. So that was when I was like,

49
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,680
I have to get out of this. That was that was mid summer 2019. And that's if you guys put the

50
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,780
timeline together was the end of 2019 when I really like almost quit doing this business,

51
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,280
which is funny because I really didn't even give this a proper chance. But anyway, long story

52
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,920
short. Yeah, and then tell us really quick, like what are some of the niches you're you don't have

53
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,600
to tell us everything. But what are some of the different niches that you're in?

54
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,520
I just listened to your advice and went straight into the tried and true. I'm still doing that.

55
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,040
Most of my deals are in concrete. Some of my deals are in tree service. The one I closed on

56
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:39,880
Sunday is is in tree service. I got a few niches that that I feel like have potential that I haven't

57
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,720
shared with people. But you know, that's for for another conversation. If I get 200,000 K,

58
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,320
I'll share it with you guys. So, you know, it's funny is an Aaron can tell you guys this is true.

59
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,360
Well, first of all, we just got Sanchezca. You guys probably saw the post just got a $1,700 a

60
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:05,760
month deal in artificial grass. This was on this is yesterday, actually. And she might have got it

61
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,640
on yesterday or Sunday. Anyway, so that's artificial grass. That's a tried and true niche. And then she

62
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:20,960
just found a really good area for concrete. And Aaron, you can even tell everyone I'm not lying

63
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,280
here. When I heard the name of the city, which you're not going to say, you better not say I

64
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,520
told I said now I don't believe it. You remember I said this is yesterday. I was like, now we're

65
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,880
gonna pull up some rush. Yeah, I was like, now we're not doing there's no way that area is open

66
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,480
for concrete. And because the city is really well known. And he's like, No, I've even looked at it

67
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,240
myself. And she started reading me the CPC. And she's like, I didn't believe it either. So for

68
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,720
those of you that are just like, Oh, my gosh, concrete's done or artificial grass down or

69
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:03,920
fencing is done. Okay. Keep complaining. So that's one of the questions I am going to actually I'm

70
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:11,200
going to jump to that one. Because it's crazy that you we can have the same training. Jason has the

71
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,640
same training as everybody else. He has the same coaching calls. He gets on there these he has the

72
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:24,560
same Facebook community. And for some reason, Jason's at $13,800 per month. And there's people

73
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,160
that are at zero that are sending me messages. And Aaron does this because he works with me directly.

74
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,160
There's people sending me messages that probably aren't on this call, because they're probably

75
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,840
busy thinking of excuses. But they're they're just blaming me, the training, the world,

76
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:50,480
the recession, the the the the rocks and the universe. And they they aren't making any money.

77
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,280
So I guess I'm going to jump towards near the end of one of the questions I was going to ask you,

78
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:03,520
which is, like, why do you why do you think you're having success? Or let me ask this one,

79
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,840
why aren't people having success that you are the same success that you are?

80
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,200
That's a good question. I, I think there's a lot of people who are

81
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,120
doing a lot better than I'm doing. I mean, wasn't

82
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,640
Yeah, but I'm saying for everyone else, and I appreciate your humility, but and there are people

83
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,560
that are crushing it. But you've also just kind of started. Right. Why? Why? Why are there some

84
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,400
people that are at zero right now? Or that are like, it's the most hardest thing to comprehend

85
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,600
how to get a deal? Like, why? It's the same thing. I can't figure it out.

86
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,160
Yeah, I understand the question. They're just not taking imperfect action. You have to take the

87
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,440
action. If you're not going to pick up the phone and call a business owner, and at least learn off

88
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,240
of that call from the very get go, you're not going to go anywhere. And Nick told us from the

89
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:04,480
very beginning, follow his step by step process. And you will close deals. So what I did is I went,

90
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,520
I created my Google ads, I generated leads. Next thing I needed to do is, okay, now I need to go

91
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,040
and learn how to hook a business owner. And I literally just followed your steps, Nick.

92
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,000
Next thing I knew I was on a closing call with a business owner.

93
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,520
Just not imperfect action, in my opinion. What do you think, Aaron?

94
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,440
I mean, I agree. Like, you talked about it before, you have the end goal.

95
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,800
You just got to do the steps that lead up to it. I mean, that's it. It is an equation.

96
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:47,120
I agree. I mean, I agree. That's definitely, that's 100% a part of it. I'm trying to think

97
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:54,160
if there's anything else. But it is bonkers from my perspective as somebody. And I remember, guys,

98
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,640
I hope you know, I remember being the person that was at zero, watching other people make money.

99
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,560
And when I'm not making money, instead of just owning it, it's so easy as a human to make excuses

100
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,960
and to try to blame everybody else and go, well, yeah, but those people don't have full-time

101
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,400
doorknocking jobs. Those people don't have kids. Those people this, those people that,

102
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,160
and then all of a sudden you want to start like, just pretending it doesn't work and you look for

103
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,800
excuses for why it doesn't work instead of just thinking, maybe I'm the freaking problem.

104
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,040
And then finally you hit this point, for those of us that are finally pull our heads out,

105
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:38,320
is for me, I remember seeing people post deals and I would get so pissed off and not in a jealous

106
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,200
way. Finally, I was just like, I would, I would see a deal and then I would click on the profile

107
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,760
and I was like, dude, I know I'm more talented than that person. Like I could just tell.

108
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,520
And I was like, if that person could do it, then I, and I hope you guys, when you see me,

109
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,800
the fact that I'm, I really, really, really am a very average person. It should inspire you that

110
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,080
anybody can do this. Because if you knew me, if you knew where I came from, if you knew the school,

111
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:16,160
I went to, if you knew my testing scores, dude, I'm not Mr. Like super smart. I think I'm just

112
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,120
Mr. Persistent and that's the truth. So I do agree though, imperfect action. Those of us that are

113
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,760
willing to be, to look stupid. I heard Jesse Insler say this on like a short the other day,

114
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,960
it's like the moment that you gave yourself permission to feel stupid is the most freeing

115
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,280
thing ever. And the problem is some of you guys want to look so cool and so tough and it's like,

116
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,080
dude, just pick up the phone. Everyone's going to say some stupid stuff. I've said things on calls

117
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:52,960
that I'm like, Oh, that was bad, dude. You know, and I have dude. So anyway, okay. That said guys,

118
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,240
Jason, why did you actually get into this industry? So what, like, what are you trying to achieve with

119
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,080
this business model? Why did you get into rank and rent specifically? What was the thing that

120
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,760
you're like, you know, for like, just for giving an example for me, I wanted to be able to travel

121
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:18,400
and like, make his like, make internet money that I wasn't tied to one location. That was the biggest

122
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,960
thing for me. What's the reason that you got into, you know, this vehicle?

123
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Yeah, mine are pretty similar to yours, Nick. When I first branched off and just burnt the ships and

124
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,160
started doing SEO, I, me and my wife created a vision board and we had all of these things

125
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,400
planned out. Like I promised her I would take her to all of these, these places to visit and stuff

126
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,520
like that. And my family was like, you know, bragging about their second vacation of the year.

127
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,920
And I hated that so much. I was like, dude, I'm not just going to save every year and try and go on

128
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,080
one vacation once a year. That's the stupidest thing ever. So we made goals where we are going

129
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,240
to travel whenever we want. And that's kind of what we're shooting for. But I also want to build

130
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,480
my dream home. I want to watch my kids take their first steps. I want to watch my kids say their

131
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,680
first words and working a nine to five job or even just spending all day in the office

132
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,200
isn't going to cut it for me. I want to be able to step outside and do things on my own terms.

133
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,640
So really, I just want a simple life, to be honest, and get paid in my sleep.

134
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,640
Pretty simple, to be honest.

135
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:34,000
I love that, dude. It's kind of like, what was I just listening to? I can't remember. I heard

136
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,200
something similar. But like, as you were saying, I was thinking, like, instead of, instead of just

137
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,320
living a life where you're just living for your next vacation, like, I don't, this just probably

138
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,560
sounds cheesy, but like, you can actually make your life a vacation in the sense that like,

139
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,360
you every day, and I kind of feel like I'm not completely there, but I'm close because

140
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,640
I have done, I have been so many places this year. And I mean, it's business as usual. Like,

141
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,480
I do do a little bit of work. You guys have seen me do Zoom calls from all over the world, but like,

142
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,280
I've been, I've been to London twice. I've been to Paris Fashion Week. I've been to Dubai.

143
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,080
I just was in Miami. I've been to LA. I've been to San Diego. I've been to Africa. I'm going to

144
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:22,240
Dubai again. I'm going to Daffer. I mean, and always just business as usual. It's just because

145
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:31,840
I want to, and I can, and why not. So, but here's the cool part, guys, is like, you don't have to

146
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,160
want to travel. Some of you guys don't want to travel. And that's completely cool, too.

147
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,560
Some of you guys want to sit at home and mow your lawn and put, you know, garden gnomes in your

148
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,440
front yard and, you know, drink sweet tea and all that stuff. And that is a cool life as well.

149
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,240
But you get to design it how you want to design it. So I was just curious for you what, what it

150
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:01,840
was. So that's awesome, dude. By the way, I'm curious, did you grow up like that? Or was it

151
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,280
like you grew up dad nine to five and that's why you feel like maybe that's why you want it's

152
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:13,760
because it's not what you had or is what you had and you want it as well? No, really. I grew up,

153
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,960
my family has worked the same job their entire life. So my dad started a cabinet company

154
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,320
and they all just work their same nine to five job. They, they look at it as job security and

155
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,600
they actually, you know, were like, dude, Jason, what the heck are you doing, bro? Like you're

156
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,640
getting scammed. You're paying somebody to teach you. Why not go get a college degree, if anything,

157
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,080
you know, that, that mindset that so many of the people in the country have, which is

158
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:47,440
complete BS, in my opinion. But really, it's just like, I don't want to be like everybody else.

159
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,600
I want to live a life on my own terms. You know, hearing people talk about, yeah, like their,

160
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,160
their first vacation of the year and, and they're all talking about how they're looking forward to

161
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,720
their next vacation 12 months from now. It just doesn't sit right with me. Like I want to be

162
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,920
taking phone calls on the golf course. I actually just went and bought some golf clubs just so I

163
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,320
can go in and just get into golfing because that's something I've always wanted to do,

164
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:23,200
but never had time. So, uh, so yeah, for you, bro. Um, for some reason, making money

165
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,680
on the golf course is a special money. It's, it slaps different. My first, my very ironically,

166
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,320
my very first money from this business was on the golf course. I've shared the story.

167
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:41,120
I was on this golf course. I remember everything. It was, it was, I know it was summer. Um, it was

168
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,080
about mid summer. It was 2000 is actually early. This is, I, this is before, I think it's even,

169
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,960
no, this is after that sidetracked. Maybe it was before, but anyway, it wasn't much. And it was a,

170
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,880
it was, everything was wrong. It was a paperly deal, but I was on a, a South gate golf course

171
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,800
and, um, I was on the second, I was in the, I was on hole 10, the back nine. I hit a really good

172
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,800
drive, which never happens. And, uh, yeah, dude, I was going, uh, I think I had, I literally think

173
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,280
I had a seven iron. I just, how much I remember seven iron and all of a sudden I heard this noise

174
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,680
on my phone or I hit, I don't know. I hit my second shot and I checked my phone and I was like,

175
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,240
dude, I just made a hundred dollars. And it was just a hundred dollars, right? Cause I was getting

176
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,480
paid per phone call. And, um, I remember being like, dude, I've made it. And that a hundred

177
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,560
dollars was so much better than I felt. I think that a hundred dollars was sweeter than the

178
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:44,560
million dollars I made in 2020. It's, it's a, it's the golf money's different, bro. So yeah, good,

179
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:50,320
good choice. Good choice. I love it. Okay. Let's talk about the last deal that you closed really

180
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,800
quick. Um, how much, what was the niche? How much like, so how much was it for thousand dollars,

181
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,800
thousand dollars per month, thousand clean thousand dollars, uh, concrete. No tree service.

182
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,480
This one's tree service. Okay. Tree service. I was supposed to have closed too in that same night,

183
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,360
but that one person slipped away. So. Gosh dang it. And there's still a chance, but yeah,

184
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,360
I would just write it off mentally. Um, how much did you spend on ads to how many leads did you

185
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:25,440
send them? So these guys, I ended up sending them five total. Uh, one came through actually,

186
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,080
no, it was four, four total. And on the closing call, I let them know. I said, Hey, one just

187
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,280
barely came through, assuming that we move forward together. Then I'll hand it over. It's not no big

188
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,640
deal, bro. That's a great thing to do, by the way, if you guys have a closing call scheduled,

189
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,040
you feel like they've, they've either closed the deal or they're interested. Use that as,

190
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,880
as a carrot. Don't just go ahead and give it to them before the call. Say, Hey, I actually,

191
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,960
Hey, I'm looking forward to our call. Um, where you're good to go. Right? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Awesome.

192
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,240
By the way, I had this really juicy lead that came in. And once we figure something out,

193
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,960
I'm going to hand it over to you as well. Like just that little incentive, don't go and send it to

194
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,760
them, you know, um, without using it as a carrot. So, um, and how much do you spend? You sent them

195
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,440
four or five total. Once you got the deal, how much did it cost you to get those five?

196
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,320
It's over a hundred bucks. So actually I started the campaign two weeks ago. Uh, this campaign's

197
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:27,200
been killing it. Like I struck a real good area. The due diligence was awesome. Uh, I actually had

198
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,960
four leads coming in four days. I had a business owner hooked, got him on a closing call. Uh,

199
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,440
wasn't able to close him because I missed one of the steps, but, uh, he just didn't have money.

200
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,840
Really? He really wasn't somebody who I could really work with. Anyways, a lead comes in the

201
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,680
very next day, got another business owner hooked. And I think four leads came in the very next four

202
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:57,920
days. So this thing moved so quick, uh, got this guy scheduled. So probably just over 200 bucks

203
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:04,160
total on this whole campaign had been spent before I closed a business owner. I love it, bro.

204
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,560
Even if you'd spent, I know some people get it out there, like I spent 200 bucks, whatever.

205
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,840
Even if it costs you 500, heaven forbid it costs you 500 because you didn't get that one. You had

206
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,040
to do two more, three more ads weren't working guys. Even if it costs you 500 bucks, as soon as

207
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,880
you make that first thousand dollars. And what I do is if I do, I always do weekly, but I try to

208
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,000
on the first payment at the very first month, I try to get the whole payment upfront just to make

209
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,520
sure like I they're good to go and they can pay a thousand bucks. You just recoup all your costs.

210
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,120
And now you made an extra 500 bucks on top of it, even if you spend $500. So don't give up on these,

211
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,840
these deals. Sometimes it costs a little bit of money, but you recoup your costs immediately.

212
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:54,000
So, um, okay. So you spent about 200 bucks on ads. Um, and, and this campaign went quick and

213
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
not all campaigns go quick guys. So don't be like, well, that'd be nice. Yeah, of course.

214
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,800
Some of the other deals you might get a lead today and it might take a week for the second one to

215
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,600
come in. Just don't put yourself in a corner and say, Hey, I'm going to get you four leads in five

216
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,760
days. Just say, I'm going to get you a couple of leads. It's going to take, it could take a few

217
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,840
days. It could take a week or two. I'm just, I want to just let you test a few of these out.

218
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,360
I want to get you really good ones. And then we're going to talk. Is that cool? Just don't

219
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,880
put yourself in a corner with expectations because we can't really control how these campaigns do.

220
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,440
So, and then my other question was going to be how many business owners you go through something

221
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,200
sounds like you went through two, right? Yeah, two total. That one, this concrete one that I just,

222
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,600
you know, I'm still going to, I'm going to put this one on the shelf, but what I did is like,

223
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,320
I kind of get pissed off when people do stuff like that, if I get ghosts or anything.

224
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,840
So I was just like, do you know what, dude, I'm going to go set up two more campaigns.

225
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,480
So I kept that one running, went up, went and set up two more campaigns. So I got two campaigns

226
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,960
running, uh, separate from that other one, just cause I was pissed. I was like, dude,

227
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,800
I'm going to get you back. But anyways, that one, uh, that one's been running for over three days.

228
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:08,160
I've got three business owners, uh, and it's just, it's just a matter of time before I find

229
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,600
somebody who's hungry because the leads are coming in. So somebody's going to want the

230
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,480
lead. Somebody's going to want to grow. Oh yeah. That's the, that's the right mentality.

231
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,840
And that's also good that you said that because I think some people might hear your other story

232
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,280
about tree service and think like, well, it always goes good for Jason, of course,

233
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,440
but that's not the case. And sometimes that happens. And sometimes maybe out of those three

234
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,920
people he's already been through, maybe the second one he messed up and that should have been the one

235
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:39,280
he got and he didn't. And now he's got to go. And I will just tell you that my mentality is

236
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,520
that if there are leads coming through, whether it's with add organically, there is always,

237
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,080
always, always a deal to be had. Do not ever give up on it. Whether we have to go into a different

238
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,880
niche that also does that, whether we have to go into another city that covers that one,

239
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,040
whatever the case is, if you are getting leads, there's always a deal to be had. So don't ever

240
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,600
give up on it. Okay. Um, this is an important question. I want to ask you, Jason, what,

241
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,360
what doubts did you have coming into this business? And also not everyone know that

242
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,160
you had to sell your truck to get into this business. Yeah. So when I heard the price,

243
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:21,120
I was like, Oh shit. I'm like, Oh boy. But I, I, I knew, I knew that it was either this or go back

244
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,880
to the nine to five, to be honest, because, and I was not going back to nine to five. And I,

245
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,160
I've been in this for long enough to realize that, or just in digital marketing in general,

246
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,040
that this business model makes so much sense. I was like, this has to be where it's at.

247
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:43,520
I control the assets. Somebody walks away from me. I maintain everything. They can't just take what

248
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,520
all of this hard work that I built up and just run off with it. You know what I'm saying? Um,

249
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,640
so the one doubt that I had when I came in wasn't necessarily the price because I knew the business

250
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,920
model worked. It was my capability of selling the deals because I'm not a salesman. I struggle

251
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:08,560
communicating sometimes. And, um, I was kind of doubting my capability of doing what you did

252
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:14,080
because with all of your sales experience, um, but I just went in there with, with trust that

253
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,880
you knew you were talking about and got to work. Have you noticed that we don't hardly ever have,

254
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,120
like me and Aaron, we're talking about this. I would say 95% of people that come into this

255
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,600
business, into this group, do not have sales experience. And have you noticed the, the,

256
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:39,120
how few times you hear people talk about not being able to sell? Aaron, you told me, we knew,

257
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,120
and I talked about this, you remember this? Yeah. What's crazy is that like, I mean, generally

258
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,120
speaking, you think sales is the most difficult part and it's the most important part. It's part

259
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,760
that most people struggle at, but with the specific process of what we do, specifically the

260
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,440
results in advance, it's like it's taken the skill out of sales. Obviously the more skill that you

261
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,520
have, the less reps it's going to take. But again, it is a formula. Like if you do 10 prospecting

262
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,400
calls, you're probably going to get one hook. If you do three hooks, you're probably going to get

263
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,560
one zoom call. If you two, three zoom calls, maybe four, you're probably going to get a close.

264
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,880
So, yeah. 100%. It's, it's amazing because I mean, I've been, I was in these other groups

265
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,760
and nobody could sell. I had to have somebody, somebody DM me just the other day. And from

266
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,720
another course I was part of and they're like, yeah, I gave this business model a go. This person

267
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,520
literally said, I have no problem getting leads and ranking websites. I just can't do the sales.

268
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,480
And I'm like, dude, that's the part in my group, in digital landlords, everybody gets deals.

269
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,840
If anything, it's sometimes finding the right business owner or tweaking the ads or whatever,

270
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,240
but like, we have no problem doing that. So anyway, it's just, it's interesting because when

271
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,240
I started this, that was the biggest issue and we've kind of like removed that entire obstacle.

272
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,320
And it's not we, it's the fact that when you send results in advance, you don't have to really sell.

273
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,360
So that's, that's the truth. So, okay. What's your why, Jason?

274
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:13,120
Jason. Family, really creating, creating it, you know, you only live once. So creating a life

275
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,760
worth living for. I don't, I don't want to spend 80% of my life away from my kids. If you include

276
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,320
sleeping and stuff like that, like I want to, I want to spend my time with my family. And I,

277
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,440
you know, I grew up with my, my dad just working all the time. Like, you, you know, he loves you,

278
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,960
but you didn't get to see him very often because he was always working, building his business.

279
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,200
And if I could build my business, maybe even homeschool my kids, like I would love that.

280
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,600
That's something that that's a life I'm striving for just to spend time with my family, to be honest.

281
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,760
Would you say you're driven by like, are you motivated to succeed or are you driven by

282
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:04,720
insecurity? Oh, I'm motivated to succeed. I, I can now see that I'm capable of reaching

283
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,520
a hundred thousand dollars a month based off of what, you know, like this, I wouldn't have had

284
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,840
this confidence if I had never joined digital networks. If I was hanging out with a free group,

285
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,520
just leeching off of other people, trying to get information out of them, I would have never had

286
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,800
the confidence to figure this out. But because I've practiced what you've taught me and it's

287
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:33,920
proven to be true. And it's I've seen the results from it. I'm already at $13,000 a month. Like,

288
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:39,600
where will I be in the next 12 months? I think I could honestly scale this to

289
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,840
30 or $50,000 within the next 12 months. Assuming I bring on the right team. But

290
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:53,440
well, here's what I look at, bro, is you're at, let's just, I'm going to say to say 14K

291
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,080
to make easy math, but like, this is what happened with me when I got my first deal.

292
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,840
And I remember getting a thousand dollars a month and going, dude, I just have to do that

293
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:09,600
100 more times. Like, which is a lot, but I saw a clear path. And so like doing what you've done,

294
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,120
I just took a hundred thousand divided by 14,000. Like if you do it seven more times or six more

295
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,440
times, plus the one that you have, like you're at a hundred, you're making money that people go to

296
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,920
school for their whole life and they don't make. And it's crazy. Like it's literally in your hands

297
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:34,080
to go make a million dollars a year doing, renting piece of crap websites.

298
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,640
It's crazy. Yeah. It's, it almost feels like you're, you're scamming the system, right?

299
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,120
I was talking to a guy the other day. He was saying how he went to school for seven years

300
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,000
for his occupation and he's making $80,000 a year.

301
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,360
And I'm sitting there like, Oh dude, like, honestly, I don't really do anything. Like if I

302
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,760
think about it, like I look at this as a game, I feel like I'm playing a game all day long where

303
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,080
like, I'm like, Oh yeah, I got a lead. Let's go. I call this business owner. And I know that I have

304
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,160
all those value that I'm bringing to the table. And if he tells me, no, I'll just give him kind

305
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,320
of like a smart aleck response and just kind of be like, okay, that's okay, dude. Like I'll just

306
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,240
call up your competition and just hand it to him. It's no big deal. You know, just to let them kind

307
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:31,200
of think about it on the way out. Yeah. It's true, bro. Yeah. When you, when you start to see that

308
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,440
there is a clear path, like I think when you get to 10,000 and 1520 and you're like, okay, I think

309
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,960
I can actually do this. It becomes very exciting because for some reason we always think it's for

310
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,560
everybody else, but not for us. And I had this conversation with a friend of mine who's a real

311
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:52,960
estate agent. And I think he's going to be joining this soon because he's been just kind of seeing

312
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,760
some stuff. He sees I'm always traveling and he's like, he's big in the real estate. He's in Vegas.

313
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,080
He'd been doing this for a long time. He's very serious about it, professional. He does his stuff.

314
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:09,440
He reads his books. He does. And he's like, he kind of was asking me like, what, what I make

315
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:17,200
and everything. And he's like, what, what? And you're in Dubai and like all the, you know, and

316
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:24,720
yeah, dude, it's, and I told him, he's like, wait, so you made seven figures in 2020s. Like you've

317
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,760
made seven figures. And I'm like, yeah. And I told him this, once you make seven figures in a year,

318
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:36,640
it like changes your identity because you can't make a million dollars and go back to being

319
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,600
less than a million. It's like, you are now a seven figure guy, a seven figure gal.

320
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,080
And come hell or high water, you are going to do it. And guys, since I made that $100,000 a month,

321
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,600
like that's just who we are. Like as a company, as a person, like I will never ever, ever go below

322
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,960
seven figures in a year. Like it just, it's just who I, what I am. It's like my standard has been

323
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,040
raised. And so anyway, dude, Jason, I have no doubt you're going to hit a hundred thousand per month.

324
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,600
But also I want to point out in the air, I'll probably tell you the same thing

325
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,640
is you can tell like when you could tell why Jason's successful because Jason has,

326
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,520
he's got that energy. He's excited. Like if Jason was talking to me about leads,

327
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,360
I would be excited to work with Jason. If Jason was talking to me as a friend about doing this

328
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,280
business model, I would be excited about doing this business model because I can hear the excitement

329
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,760
in his voice. And it's as a reminder guys, sales, the transfer of energy. And some of you guys are

330
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,400
sitting there calling and you sound like you're, I would rather watch paint dry on a wall than

331
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,720
listen to your sorry ass talk about this business. And sometimes you've got to be excited. I tell

332
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,800
Francesca this every time she gets on a phone, on a sales call, because she does the sales for our

333
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,640
agency now, which by the way has been amazing because I don't have to do that anymore.

334
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,080
But I'm like Francesca, just remember sales are the transfer of energy. And if you're excited

335
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,040
about it, they're going to be excited about it. If you're dull about it, they're going to be dull

336
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,680
about it. And so you guys can hear it in Jason's voice. He's so excited about it. He's, it's a game

337
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,320
it's, it's whatever. So that's huge. And some of you guys don't have that right now and you need

338
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,880
to get that. So, Jason, for time's sake, we're going to cut it right there. I think we need to

339
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,720
do a part two. I think we also should maybe bless everyone in the free group and just do a random

340
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,920
look, go live and let people hear your story. But congrats on your success. I know you're just

341
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:31,040
getting started. I'm not surprised with your success, but I'm also proud of you, bro. So keep

342
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,280
it up. Thanks, man. Hey, I just wanted to ask you one question real quick. So you played

343
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:41,760
basketball for Pera one, right? Yeah. What are you going to ask me? Yeah, dude. So I, I played

344
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,360
for Juab and we played against you guys when I was in high school. I think you're a few years

345
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,480
Okay, go ahead. I didn't know that. You know, some other podunk high school, you know,

346
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:58,560
no, so you're, so you're, you're from Nephi. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that school is way bigger

347
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,800
than mine, by the way. It's like, I'd way rather be from Nephi. No kidding. Go ahead. Ask me.

348
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,960
Anyways, dude, I'm like, my dude, if, if Pera one's so small, I like went in and like looked at max

349
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,200
preps, you know, like the high school and I like found all the wood brothers and like, dude,

350
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,240
like they were like, you guys were probably the jocks back in the day, weren't you?

351
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,920
Yeah. I mean, we had, what else do you do in Pera one?

352
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,560
That's just awesome. I just wanted to bring that up. Well, I'll say this by the way,

353
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:30,960
because everyone will know Porter, me, Zach hands down, Porter was the best athlete out of all of

354
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,760
us. So he, you guys, you guys can always bring that up. Porter can always hold that over our heads.

355
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:44,960
So Porter was definitely, but also just so Porter can be humbled. He also was terrible until he'd

356
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,240
tell about his junior senior year. He was like, dude, is this kid like, it's a little slow, like

357
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,920
mentally, like he was just a little bit of a late bloomer, but he was really good as a senior. So

358
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,840
I was probably the worst out of all three of us. So that's why I'm really trying to take this

359
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,680
making money thing seriously and just kind of put them in their place. I'm just kidding. But yeah,

360
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:12,240
anyway, so yeah, just long story short, small towns, podunk towns, dude, my high school,

361
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,000
I don't even think it's accredited. I don't think, I think if you went back to the teachers,

362
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,440
not all of them, but there was a couple of teachers, I know they didn't have college degrees.

363
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,880
We had teachers sneaking out in the middle of class, like pretending to go to their car.

364
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,240
We'd catch them out smoking fricking whatever out, like not joints, but like cigarettes and

365
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:34,880
in the green house, like teachers, students, teacher relationships. I mean, dude, the weirdest

366
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,840
stuff that was like completely normal to me, but completely inappropriate. So if somebody from

367
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:50,480
high school like me or Porter can make this work. Yeah, dude, you have no excuse or juap. Let's be

368
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:59,360
honest. Anyway, thanks for coming on, Jason. We'll talk soon. Yeah. See you guys.
