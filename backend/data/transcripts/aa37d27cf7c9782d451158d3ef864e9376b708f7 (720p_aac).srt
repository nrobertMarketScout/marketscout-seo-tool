1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
Okay, B says, Nick, what do you do when people call

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,860
and ask if this is so-and-so company when you run ads?

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,340
Do you do something to make the ads stop generating those?

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,220
No, so what I usually do is I usually try my best

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,700
to turn those into leads.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,700
So we'll say, no, did you already call us?

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,100
Or we'll usually just say,

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,700
were you looking for an estimate?

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,740
Oh, yeah, but I was looking for so-and-so company

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,180
or they already gave me an estimate.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,080
Oh, okay, cool.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,640
Well, we'd love to give you another estimate.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,880
Are you open to getting another free estimate?

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,240
And we'll just try and turn it into another lead.
