1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,480
So why do we use paid ads? Well, I'm gonna tell you. I'm gonna share a quick story. If

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,400
you guys haven't heard the story already, great. If you have, bear with me for just

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,180
one moment. 2019, I realized in order for me to hit my goal, my goal at the time was

4
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,380
I wanted to get to $100,000 per month in revenue. And I realized I couldn't do that being a

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,780
salesman for somebody else. I couldn't do that by being an employee. And so I'm like,

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,020
I gotta figure this out. But at the time, I had about $8,000 in revenue coming in. I

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,540
had SEO deals. I had a little bit of lead gen and I had some paper lead, had no commission,

8
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,660
and had one or two flat fee deals. And I took inventory of my stuff and I almost forgot

9
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,220
about these couple of flat fee deals. And I looked at it and I'm like, dude, these guys

10
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,220
have been the most low maintenance of any of them. So why don't I do more of that? And

11
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,460
I'm like, okay, it's got to be that. It's got to be that flat fee stuff because in the

12
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,580
winter it's not going to go down. I'm going to be able to calculate everything. It's going

13
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,180
to be the same, you know, it just made sense to me. Okay. So I started realizing, I'm like,

14
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,580
I'm going to do the math. How do I get to $100,000? And I'm like, okay, well, I know

15
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,980
that if I build a site today, it's going to take a minimum of three to six months, three

16
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,140
if I'm really good at doing my due diligence, six if I'm okay. And if I do a bad job, I'm

17
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,860
going to need to spend 12, 18 months before a site ranks. Started doing the math. I'm

18
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,700
like, I'm going to need this many sites and this much ranking and assuming this many don't

19
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,580
work, I'm going to need to spend a lot of money every month to scale this puppy up.

20
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,060
And so I figured out, I'm like, okay, well, you know, and by the way, just so everybody

21
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,620
knows, I heard of this concept. I wasn't the first one to invent it. And this whole strategy

22
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,220
of giving leads in advance, Costco invented it and probably somebody before them. But

23
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,420
I heard of this idea of why don't you run a little bit of ads to juice it up? Why don't

24
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,180
you run a little bit of ads to get the phones ringing? And I'm like, that's a, that's a

25
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:02,020
great concept. And so I started running with it. And so in 2020, the beginning of 2020,

26
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,780
that's when I really took hold of this concept. I'm like, Hey, what if we could use other

27
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,660
people's money to scale? What if we didn't actually need to build the website before

28
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,420
we got the deal? What if we could set up a landing page, push traffic, get the lead,

29
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,900
get the deal and then build out the property? What would that look like? And so that's why

30
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,060
we use ads. We use ads to speed up the deal. So if you have a site right now and it fits

31
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,700
the criteria for module one and it's producing consistent leads, you probably don't need

32
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,620
to run ads. Okay. The thing that I like about it though, is it does speed up the deal. It

33
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,260
does allow you that let's say the winter comes and it gets a little slow on the organic side,

34
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,900
pop in the ads and it supplements. You know what else I like about it? GMB goes down,

35
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,460
throw in the ads, supplements it. Okay. So there's a number of reasons, but the number

36
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,820
one reason is we are trying to speed this process up. So I'm going to share really,

37
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,660
briefly three reasons, the three main reasons why I love running ads. Number one reason is speed,

38
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,580
as I've already mentioned. Okay. I don't know about you, but I ain't got four to six months

39
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,660
to wait for a little towing site or a little, I shouldn't even say towing. I hate towing.

40
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,780
A concrete site, a tree service. I don't have four to six months to wait. I want to hit my goals

41
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,060
today, baby. I don't want to wait. Okay. So by running these ads, it's allowing us to put up

42
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:17,540
a landing page, push ads, get calls today, sell today or tomorrow or the next day, get the deal

43
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,980
and then build out and be making money the entire time. Number two reason is this is going to allow

44
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,820
us to scale. Okay. A lot of you are in the same position I was in in 2000, the end of 2019,

45
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:34,820
beginning of 2020 where it's like, yeah, I get this. I love it. I'm sold, but I don't have the

46
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,340
money to build out a hundred sites and time, you know, hosting times a hundred, call tracking

47
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:47,460
number times a hundred, whatever, hosting domain, all this times a hundred. Okay. I didn't have the

48
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:53,700
money. I don't want to have to pay a VA times a hundred to go and do the backlinks and the content

49
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,740
and all this stuff. I don't, I didn't have the money. So if you want to scale, the best way to

50
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:04,740
scale in real estate, physical real estate and in digital real estate is called, it's by using OPM.

51
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:11,220
Other people's money. So by using ads, it allows us to get the deal upfront, use the money from the

52
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,740
deal to build out the property that we own, the asset and to scale the sucker up. Number three

53
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,700
reason is this allows us to test. This is the third reason we use Google ads. Okay. So what do I mean

54
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,300
by that? Well, it allows us to actually put up a one pager that takes a couple of minutes, 30 minutes

55
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,300
to an hour, set up an ad, which take us a couple of minutes, 30 minutes to an hour until you get

56
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,940
fast at it. I can do it in five minutes now. It allows us to spend a couple of bucks, probably up

57
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,460
to a hundred and we can go and test out a market. Meaning maybe the tool that we looked at, maybe it

58
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,780
was mangles, maybe it was keyword planner, maybe it was SEMrush, maybe the tool said there's volume,

59
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,020
but maybe there's not because these tools aren't always accurate. I'd rather spend a hundred bucks

60
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:56,260
in two days of my time than I would spend six months of my time and heaven knows how many

61
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,300
thousands of dollars just to find out there's no volume. I'm ranked number one whoop-de-doo.

62
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,020
There's no, there's no volume. There's no people calling or worse. There's no hungry business

63
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,020
owner. So if I get in, I can set this thing up quick. I could spend a hundred bucks. I get a lead.

64
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,340
Okay, cool. I know there's volume. And now I can use that lead to go start calling around and see

65
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,220
if there's actually hungry business owners in the area. Guys, I love this so much because

66
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,700
it allows you to almost go into the future, say, Hey, in theory, if I did have this thing ranking,

67
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,780
if it was producing, would there be somebody that would pay for this? Yes or no. Okay, awesome.

68
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,380
There's leads coming in. There's business owners that are hungry. Let's fricking do this. Those

69
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:43,620
are the three reasons why we use Google ads. Let's dive in and get some ads set up, baby.
