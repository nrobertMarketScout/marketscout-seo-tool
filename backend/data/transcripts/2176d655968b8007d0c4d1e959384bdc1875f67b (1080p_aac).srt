1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
So once we get a client, what's our process from there?

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,480
What's the first thing that we do with the client?

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,320
We sign the contract.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,240
What's the first thing that we do from there?

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,360
Yeah, we sign the contract, get the credit card,

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,640
get a credit card authorization, then run the credit card.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,440
Make sure that it goes through.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,720
We just ran the credit card.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,920
We just did the pre-authorization.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
But do we send out an email?

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,680
Do we schedule a phone call?

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,560
What does our next step look like to set those expectations?

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:31,920
Yeah.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,280
So when I'm closing the deal, I like to also add in expectations

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,760
and how everything will work.

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,520
I include that into the closing call.

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,320
And then I, well, the contract, the card, whatever that part we already said.

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,880
And then I send them an email with things that I need from them.

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,120
That I do have a template, but sometimes it depends on the business owner

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,760
because for example, we need to set up a GMB or photos.

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,920
It's just a list of things that I need from the owner.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,200
And I include that in the email.

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,920
It's like a welcome email where you get them a little pumped up

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
and you ask them information that you need to get started,

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,440
like phone number and stuff like that.

26
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,120
All the things that you need in order to make the website for them

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,680
and literally make the whole project.

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,080
So as soon as the deal is closed, then we just let them know,

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
hey, you're going to get an email from me.

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,600
I'm going to ask you for a couple of things.

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,680
I need you to give us this information.

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,440
And then from there, we can get things started.

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,680
So that's step number one is an email goes out.

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,200
Yeah.

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,480
So email goes out.

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,160
What happens after the email?

37
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,160
So after that, I just wait for them to respond with the information.

38
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,240
And then after they send that over, I don't really contact them

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,080
until everything is done.

40
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,680
And then when everything is built out,

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,400
which usually doesn't take us more than a week,

42
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,080
less than a week usually,

43
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,840
then I update them and tell them, hey, we're all done with the site

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,680
and just kind of give them an update.

45
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,000
And then after that, it depends on the client, to be honest.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,600
Does the update happen on the phone?

47
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,480
Does it happen on email?

48
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,440
Does it happen on text?

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,800
See, that also depends because some clients will not answer their phones

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,840
and they just text me back.

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,800
They're like, hey, what's up?

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,040
And that way, I just usually send them a text.

53
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,800
Most of the time, I like to call them or email them is even better.

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,760
That way, I don't know.

55
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,880
I just like having the record, but it does depend on the client.

56
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,160
After that, yeah, I just check in with them.

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,600
And obviously, another thing that you'll do to contact them is

58
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,120
after that is built, you want to test the site,

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,360
which also that would also mean, obviously,

60
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,960
that you're going to call them when you're testing the Legion site.

61
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,080
So that's another way to kind of check in on the first week.

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,640
So the first week, you talk to them often.

63
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,080
You send them the email.

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,680
You call them to test the site.

65
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,360
You call them or text them or email them to let them know, hey, this is finished.

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,880
And yeah, after that, I check in with them every month.
