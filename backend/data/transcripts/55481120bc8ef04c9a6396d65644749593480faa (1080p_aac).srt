1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
All right. There we go. All right, guys. Welcome to the call. November 5th election day. Wow.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,760
Here we go. Got two months left in the year. First and foremost, just to get really, we're

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,560
going to get right into it today. But one thing I wanted to say is I wanted to thank

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,200
everybody who was part of our beta test group. We appreciate you guys. I'm going to be bringing

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,400
Ryan on here in a second. We appreciate you guys putting trust in the product and knowing

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:36,360
we'll make sure that it's a great product. We're trying to implement. I'm giving Ryan feedback. I

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,280
hear you guys. I have my team working on it. We're trying to get as much feedback as possible.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,480
It's not going to be perfect, but we're going to work our way towards it. We're going to allow you

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:51,320
guys to help us build this tool. And I'm going to be able to help take your feedback, give it to

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,360
Ryan, and create the best rank and rent tool on the internet. Okay? So anyway, I wanted to

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,880
let you guys know that we appreciate you guys being part of that beta test group.

12
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,840
And yeah, that's basically all I wanted to say before I bring Ryan on. I'm going to bring Ryan

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,840
Dalton, Mr. $87,000 per month. If you guys do not know Ryan Dalton, maybe you just joined the group.

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,320
Ryan joined back a little over two years ago and has scaled up to $87,000 per month. He is a master

15
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:26,200
of systems. He's a master of organization. And this was a perfect project for him to take all

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,640
of his skill sets and put it into creating the perfect tool, the only tool that you need.

17
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,520
And today, specifically, we're going to be talking about search volume and what the minimum search

18
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,040
volume needs to be for you to have confidence to go into a city, any niche. And on top of that,

19
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,440
we're also going to be answering questions, going into more of the tool itself for any of you guys

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,360
that had questions. I know we had the call earlier. I guess it was last night for you guys. It was

21
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,000
earlier today for me, and we had a bunch of really, really good questions. So any questions that you

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,320
have related to the software we want to answer, clear up, et cetera. We're going to talk about

23
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,920
search volume. And then if we have any time for anything else, we'll do that as well. So let me

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,800
bring Ryan on really quick and we will get going. Hold on. Three, two, one, admits.

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,960
And apparently, oh, there we go. We're working.

26
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:26,440
Yo. Can you hear me? Yeah, I got you. Beautiful. Okay. Ryan Dalton. Welcome to the call, dude.

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,800
Hey, everybody. Yeah, I know some people that they were on the call that was for me this morning.

28
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,280
This has been the longest day of my life. I got two hours and 11 minutes of sleep, exactly per

29
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,360
the watch here, per the whoop, two hours, 11 minutes. But I did get a little nappy on the couch.

30
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:53,080
Good to be back. We had Ryan on a few times and you guys should know who he is. If not, then you

31
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,880
guys need to be a little more active in the group. Mr. $87,000 per month joined a little over two

32
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:05,080
years ago, full-time job, family, kids, the entire thing, all the objections that people used to have

33
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,600
don't have time. I've got kids, blah, blah, blah. Ryan basically ruined that for all of you guys

34
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,160
because he's got all of those objections and he still did it. So anytime anyone tells me any of

35
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,520
these things, I just send them the interview with Ryan. I'm like, well, this guy did it. So it's

36
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,320
possible, which means it's possible for you. So what we're going to do today, guys, as I mentioned,

37
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,400
I want to get right into this. I want to specifically talk about search volume because

38
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,480
it's something that we've been talking about. We haven't been putting it off, but I've really

39
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,080
wanted to make sure we get it dialed in so that we don't give you guys bad advice or something

40
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,960
I'm not a hundred percent confident in. So over the past few weeks, since we launched this tool,

41
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,280
what's it been, Ryan, four and a half weeks, something like that? Yeah, about four and a half

42
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,800
weeks. I've been going in looking at not just one of my projects, but I've looked at like four or

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,080
five, six of my projects that are ranking very well consistently for years, looking at how many

44
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,640
leads they have. They're ranked really high, looking at what the tool says to them and then

45
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:12,920
saying, okay, if I was to make a guess, what's the minimum search volume that a city and niche has to

46
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:19,560
have? Okay. So anyway, Ryan, anything that you want to cover before we get started on that front

47
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:26,040
or anything that you want to chat on other than that? I just think it's a super important call.

48
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,880
This stuff is not static. I mean, it changes over time. So revisiting some of the fundamentals of

49
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,920
local lead generation is always a great way to spend some time. Search volume I've found

50
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:43,560
more and more with my agency is king, right? Where everything for me begins with search volume. So

51
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,080
having conversations about what people see as working and what isn't is very useful.

52
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:57,480
And search volume, guys, it's part of due diligence. And I will stand by this forever.

53
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,120
Due diligence is the most important step in the process, right? Because no matter how good you

54
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:11,240
are at sales, if you do a bad job on picking an area and there's no hungry business owners,

55
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,400
your life becomes very difficult. If you pick a really good city that's low competition,

56
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,080
great search volume, lots of hungry business owners, you could be a mediocre at best salesman,

57
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:27,480
not even a good salesperson, and you're going to get deals. So I truly believe that due diligence

58
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,160
is actually the most important step in the process. And this is part of due diligence. Now,

59
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,560
I did notice that there was a couple other questions like what about this, that, and the

60
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:45,080
rest. Some of those things, if we don't know the exact, we don't have a very solid answer yet per

61
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,200
the tool, because this is going to be our staple tool going forward, then I'm going to let you guys

62
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,600
know that. But specifically on search volume, we are going to address that today. Okay? So

63
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,840
really quick, though, just to welcome people in the call, we've got Simon, we've got Nicholas

64
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,600
Kudlick, we've got Beau, we've got Kevin Mijo, we've got Corey Gilbert, Mr. St. George Utah,

65
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:17,800
Ryan Martez, we've got JC Crozier, what's going on? We've got Jason Allred, Mr. Utah, Ryan,

66
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,320
the best example of F your excuses, a hundred percent. Corey says, Ryan Dalton, I have that

67
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,080
same safe. If you want to go shoot some Tannerite, let me know. Dude, let's go. Let's go, man. I put

68
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,960
some 556s and Tannerite with you. You guys and your Tannerite, dude. You know, it's funny. I

69
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,840
actually met Corey in person and we actually had the same conversation about Tannerite. So

70
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,840
I have a feeling he's got a few stacks of that stuff. It's good to have someone stand by. Yeah,

71
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,480
you have to. You have to. Okay. So guys, let's start with this. I want to start with how we

72
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:02,360
used to recommend the search volume. Okay. Now I want to go very basic. Search volume. And Ryan,

73
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,960
I know that for you, you do look at population a little bit. You've kind of kind of a slightly

74
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:14,920
different process. But for me, I kind of just go sheer like basically almost exclusively off of

75
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,440
search volume, because in my mind, it doesn't really matter. I do think population matters

76
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,800
to an extent because the bigger the population, typically the more competitive. Would you agree

77
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,760
with that? Yeah. I mean, certainly there's a correlation. I pay attention to population

78
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,960
insofar as I'm interested in if it's a growth area, right? Where maybe other people are not

79
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,600
looking because I'm able to look there and see like, all right, two years ago, this was the

80
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,080
population. Now it's this population. If it continues at this rate, it's this population.

81
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,800
And if there's people moving there, people building homes or whatever, that's going to

82
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,080
increase search volume over time and I can get in early. But aside from that, search volume is king

83
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:02,280
for sure. That's a good point. And when I disregard search or population, it's in the sense of like

84
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,800
I've been in other programs where they don't even talk about search volume. It's just like

85
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,760
go into a city with this kind of a population and that's it. I like what Ryan's saying and I'll give

86
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,840
you guys a good example. Bentonville, Arkansas, Bentonville concrete. You guys have heard me

87
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,600
share this example many, many times. Bentonville concrete was a very low population when I started.

88
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,800
The reason I was confident going into that city, guys, is because I had lived in that city for

89
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,440
three summers in a row and I had watched every summer that we came back. There was new

90
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,840
neighborhoods popping up everywhere and I had heard that Walmart had implemented this rule

91
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,320
that said if you want to sell to Walmart, if you are a vendor, if you are somebody that sells

92
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,560
jerky, for example, to Walmart, you have to have somebody from your office living in that city.

93
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,640
I'm like, okay, that means that if people are going to keep selling to Walmart, they have to

94
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,600
have somebody that lives in the city, naturally the city is going to keep growing. That was just like

95
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,720
an intuition gut instinct type of a decision that I made and I knew the area. I think that's really

96
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,400
important and we may end up adding that to the training. Real quick, how do you look at,

97
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,160
do you just go ahead and search population growth over the past five years for the specific city?

98
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,480
Yeah, so I'll use chat GPT and prompt it with a question about population growth and it'll

99
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:32,280
give me instances of cities that are growing. Then I also do what you do where I live in Tennessee

100
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,080
and I know which areas are growing because I know my area and then I know areas where friends live

101
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,120
and I just listen. I'm always thinking about local lead generation. They're talking about their new

102
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,240
you know move to some area in Tennessee and they're talking about how everyone's moving

103
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,160
there and how it's the new like little darling hotspot. I think probably a good spot for a site

104
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,680
and so I'll go look at that and see like, okay, the numbers are not quite what I want them to be

105
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,920
just on its face but I know this area is growing so I'm going to see what happens and usually turns

106
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,760
out pretty good. I like that. Give us an example. You don't have to give us too much your secret

107
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:20,120
sauce but when you say a prompt with chat GPT, what do you mean? Do you say, hey, what are some

108
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,200
of the areas, what cities in the US, what cities in the Midwest have a 200% increase in population

109
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,240
over the past five years like something like that? Yeah, you can't really go wrong with your prompt

110
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,240
if you're trying to get it population growth. I start pretty wide. I start just in the United

111
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:43,560
States and I say give me the suburbs in the United States that have the greatest population

112
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,280
growth over the last, over the previous two years and it'll think for a second and then it'll spit

113
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:54,840
out you know however many, right? I can tap it and say give me the most recent 20 and that's where

114
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,040
I'll start my due diligence, right? Where I'll look at, okay, these are growing and maybe these

115
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,360
are off the radar of other lean generators. They're not looking at these yet and that can

116
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,360
also filter by population size. So if I think that you know the population is too big and it's growing,

117
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,960
I could say give me populations under you know 100,000 and then I'll take that and plug it into

118
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,280
search volume tools and look at, okay, what is the actual search volume? Because I don't really care

119
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:26,120
like you said about population being like the metric. I want it to be what is the actual search

120
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,280
volume but I will start with is this an area that is trending because trending growth means

121
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,520
that there's people that are buying things. They have to build. They have to you know refurbish

122
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,160
homes. There's people that are probably going to invest in those markets that are looking to

123
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,840
replace their driveways and their brick and those kinds of things. So genius. I think that's really,

124
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,520
really smart. So anyway that's just something to think about guys. One other little wrinkle

125
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,520
and guys, the answer that we're going to come give you here in just a moment on the search volume

126
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:02,440
side per what RankinRent Engine says, there are going to be some caveats to it, okay?

127
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:12,040
So let's, I'm trying to think. I don't think we necessarily need to show this on the RankinRent.

128
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:18,360
So what I'll do, maybe I'll just discuss what I think is going to be the, I'm trying to think

129
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,880
what would be the best way if I could, do we think we need to show this or we could just kind of

130
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,960
discuss it and then we can get into the tool after? Yeah, let's talk through it and then we

131
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:36,040
can show it. Okay. So I'm going to pull up some of the metrics that I found. Let's see. Let me go to,

132
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:46,920
so here's what I did guys. All right there. So as I told you was I was coming up with this

133
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,720
and again, the thing that we're addressing is what, when you're doing your due diligence,

134
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,000
what is the minimum search volume that can give you the, at least in that area that says, hey,

135
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,640
I know at the very least there's going to be enough volume because some of the issues that

136
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:09,880
people run into is they go into a city, it looks good, it's low competition, it's the right niche,

137
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,520
you know, whatever, and they start running ads and they get a couple leads and then it's like,

138
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,640
it just dies, right? Or I don't know, have you ever had this happen, Ryan? You build a website,

139
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:27,480
you rank it and you're still only getting like 10 leads and you're like the number one person.

140
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,240
Have you ever had that happen or have you never gone to a city that has that low search? Many

141
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,720
times, many times. And the mistake, the number one mistake that I made when that's happened

142
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:42,360
is I get impatient and I need it. I did that in, I'll just say, I did that in Selena, Texas,

143
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,600
the suburb of, I think it's the Dallas, Fort Worth area. And it was not getting what I wanted. I

144
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,600
thought it's going to go great. And I just got impatient and I was like, I'm not renewing this

145
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,520
domain. I'm getting rid of this domain. I don't just nuke the site, just get rid of it, right?

146
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,880
I don't want a bunch of riffraff in my site portfolio. The mistake I made is that that city

147
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,400
is still growing, right? It's still like, there's only so much space in the Dallas, Fort Worth area.

148
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:16,280
And so it's going to eventually be within my parameters, right? And it might go from,

149
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:24,040
10 leads to 20 leads over the course of the next couple of years per month. And I should have kept

150
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,440
it, right? So I just let those sit because all that's going to happen is that domain is going to

151
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,760
age. It's going to get hit with some more backlinks. It's going to, and it'll be number one forever.

152
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:41,160
You can't beat that very easily. That's so hyper local that you're glued to the top at that point.

153
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:47,560
Glued, glued. So that's a good point. And I actually have a situation like that as well.

154
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,800
And just because I don't check it long enough, it was kind of pissing me off. It wasn't getting

155
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:00,600
enough leads. We got a deal, but it was very low. And then the city just started growing. It's a

156
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,120
city in Utah. And it's kind of like, over the past, this year, I'll give you an example,

157
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,400
looking at the data right now, this is a city of the population of 35,000. And it's averaged,

158
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:18,120
there isn't concrete. It's averaged 13.1 calls per month. This is through October 30th. And it's

159
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:26,520
averaged another 3.7 per month with the quote form. So I'm averaging close to 18 leads per month.

160
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,440
And I almost ripped the city. It's not making me a ton of money. It's making me like 600 bucks

161
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,640
a month. But dude, 500, 600 bucks a month, go find that on a real estate deal right now.

162
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,120
You know what I'm saying? Yeah. And where else is that business owner going to get leads?

163
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:47,720
Exactly. What other option do they have? If you're getting 18 leads a month in that area,

164
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,240
and you're number one, and you're running ads, and you're doing everything right,

165
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,640
what other options do they have at that point? You're locked in with that business owner.

166
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,440
100%. 100%. So here's the projects I looked at. I want to give you guys kind of a range.

167
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:08,120
I looked at, let me see. We got one, two, three, four. I looked at five different projects.

168
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,760
And when I did the training before version one and version two, I basically just took one project

169
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,480
because it was ranking really well. That was Bentonville Concrete. And I said, okay,

170
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,840
I know how many leads this is getting. It's ranking in the GMB. It's ranking in the maps.

171
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,800
And I want to compare that with what the tool says. Well, one thing that happened that I didn't

172
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,600
even think about is as we start to talk about Bentonville Concrete, the people in the group,

173
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,360
and maybe even in the free group, are searching Bentonville Concrete. So I think, I personally

174
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,480
think it had an effect and kind of skewed the numbers a little bit on that city. It drove the

175
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,680
cost up significantly on the cost per click and everything else. So I ended up looking at five

176
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:58,120
different projects. Of those, one, two, three of those are in concrete. One of them is in towing

177
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,480
and one of them is in duct cleaning. I kind of wanted to get a little bit of a mix.

178
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:09,240
We had a ranging population. One of them was a 35,000 population. All the way up to the highest

179
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:16,520
was a 95,000 population. So nothing that's too big, okay? But here's what I came up with. And

180
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:22,760
this is what Ryan and I, after discussing with his research, my research, is that we don't have

181
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:31,640
an exact, exact, exact, but we have a range. And what we mean by that is if you go into a city

182
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:41,480
that is very low-hanging fruit, very non-competitive, low CPC, not much competition,

183
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,320
that you can just tell the people that are in the, that are ranking for those keywords,

184
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,760
brand new websites, or they're not very old, they don't have much content, they don't have

185
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,160
much backlinks. It looks like just a bunch of hillbilly freaking people ranking against you.

186
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:02,120
In those situations, we can safely say 50 on it, again, using the rank and rent engine search tool,

187
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
due diligence tool. If it says 50, you're in good hands. That's on a low competition

188
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,560
area. If it's on a medium competition area where, okay, a couple of your competitors on,

189
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,840
you know, for your main keywords, they have a pretty good website. Maybe you're going up

190
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,360
against a rank and rent person that's a medium competition. You could still rank,

191
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,040
but it's going to be a bit more difficult. Maybe the CPC is tipping closer to five,

192
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:31,560
maybe even slightly over. You want to make sure you're at least 70, okay? And again,

193
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:38,280
this is on your main keyword, your main keyword. What was the other thing? Oh,

194
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,240
then the last thing I was going to say, and on those cities that are high competition,

195
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,480
you shouldn't be going into anyway, you freaking dummies. No, I'm just kidding.

196
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,240
But if it's high competition, you shouldn't be going into it. So if it's medium competition,

197
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,080
make sure it's 70. If it's low competition, 50 you can get away with. And that's good. I

198
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,600
feel pretty dang confident about saying that. Now, keep in mind, if you're running ads,

199
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,080
the ads during the winter, during certain times of the year, it's going to be up and down a bit.

200
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,640
But we know that if we can get the ads going, if we can get ranked organically,

201
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,160
and you know, in some cases, maybe grab a GMB if you get lucky, then you're going to be in

202
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,480
great shape. So anything you want to add to that, Ryan, I know that's like a bit anticlimactic. Maybe

203
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,200
you guys expect it to be something different, but again, this is not with any tool because we're not

204
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:33,160
before it was use any tool. We're specifically talking about rank and rent engine with this.

205
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,120
And that's why we wanted to wait to come out with this. So go ahead, Ryan.

206
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,520
Totally. I think Nick nailed it. I agree with this. This is my assessment as well.

207
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:46,600
These things change over time. This is why Nick's group, Digital Landlords, you know, why you're

208
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,360
staying on the cutting edge of the trade craft of this industry is really important because these

209
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,360
are not, it's not static. These are things to revisit and these things to look at. But there

210
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,760
are some things that are like timeless principles. One of them being that search volume is going to be

211
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,640
the largest like driver for success for what a market looks like. And so really paying attention

212
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,280
to what's succeeding and what isn't matters a lot. Those numbers are, I totally agree with those

213
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,120
numbers. The only little thing that I would add to that is that, and I think I saw a question kind

214
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:23,480
of getting to this in the chat, that the search volume for the primary keyword should include

215
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:31,080
variants of that keyword. So for example, concrete contractor, contractor near me, right? Those are

216
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:37,240
going to, if you have like 40 for one and 20 for the other, that's showing 60 between the two of

217
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,840
those. That's like, that's your primary keyword and a variant of it. That's going to get you the

218
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:49,160
results that you're looking for. Okay. I have a question for you. I'm curious your thoughts.

219
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,600
Let's say I go into rank and run engine. I'm doing concrete. I have concrete contractor,

220
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,000
concrete, concrete sidewalk, concrete driveway, concrete company, all the main keywords of our

221
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:09,720
keyword list. My main keyword has 50 and all my other keywords show zero. What are you going into

222
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:19,560
this? Low competition. If it's low competition, I'd try it and see what happens. It's generally

223
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:33,560
not a good sign if the core keyword list has zero as search volume, because I found that those are

224
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:43,720
likely often true. However, the caveat that I give on this is that if it shows zero for those and you

225
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:50,920
go into it and try it, there are examples I found where it has turned out awesome. So it's worth

226
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,800
trying is what I would say, especially with you guys that do the pre-selling method. It's worth

227
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,720
trying because what do you have to lose, right? A little bit of ad spend to know if it works or

228
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,760
it doesn't, and it's a place that others will overlook, right? Because they're saying like,

229
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:11,640
oh, this is too low, whatever. But these tools, even the very best like rank and run engine pulls

230
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:18,280
directly in from Google. Google Keyword Planner is the best, right? That is Google saying, here's what

231
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:27,000
we're seeing in our search ecosystem. And that is the standard, right? And so we're pulling in API

232
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,520
data from them. And so if Google is saying that, sometimes they don't always know perfectly. And

233
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:38,120
if Google doesn't know, these other tools sure don't know. So you might be able to find one where

234
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,040
you're going to be able to win and you're not going to have anyone that's going to come in and try to

235
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,920
catch you before you can close the business owner. So I've had that happen before as well. So it

236
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:56,120
doesn't deter me. That's another thing that I like. When I was using SEMrush before, it seemed

237
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:05,240
for whatever reason I would type in, let's say Bentonville concrete, it would show nothing. And

238
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:12,680
then I type in concrete Bentonville AR, and it would show 50. And it was so confusing. But the

239
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,080
way that I kind of went after it, I was always like, I was guessing a bit, but I was like, well,

240
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,760
if I see at least two keywords, two variations, and I have all these different variations I would

241
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:29,400
try, okay, then I'm good. Like with St. George, for example, St. George, people spell it S-T

242
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,000
George. Some people spell it S-A-I-N-T George. So I'd have to try all these variations. So anyway,

243
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,120
it's just nice because I'm able to just go and look at all the keywords at once if I'm like,

244
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,400
okay, I want to try just a slight difference. Yeah, I can go change it all at once and run them

245
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:49,000
instantly. But I definitely agree, guys. That's the beautiful thing about doing the pre-song.

246
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,520
I was just going to say, Ryan, if I were to ask you, hey, with that same scenario, 50 search volume,

247
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:01,400
zero on the other keywords, would you go and build a website there by the domain, do the whole thing?

248
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,240
I bet you your answer would be no, because you're not 100% confident. But I'd be willing to try it

249
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,760
for 100 bucks, right? Throw 100 bucks ads out. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't think there's a wrong

250
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:17,480
answer there. Some people will put up sites just to put up a site and see what happens and then

251
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,800
let it sit. And then the worst case scenario is, is two years later, you've got a domain age

252
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,480
of two years that no one can touch you on if they try to come in there, at least on that,

253
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:32,200
on your domain age. But it makes way more sense if you're optimizing for speed and just trying

254
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,440
to see which one is going to land to, hey, throw something up there, run some ads to it. If it

255
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:45,320
doesn't work, move on. 100%. And I would argue, guys, if you are going into a niche like a concrete

256
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:51,560
and you find a city that's really low-hanging fruit and it's questionable, you know that this

257
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,320
example I'm giving you guys with the 35,000 population, it's slowly started to grow.

258
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:02,600
You know people need concrete. So even if you build it and there's not a ton of leads,

259
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,880
there's always a deal to be had. But because I believe in pre-selling, because I only sell

260
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,880
using the pre-selling method, I know that some of you guys have been frustrated in the past

261
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,080
because you go in, it looks good. It's low-hanging fruit. It's kind of on that teetering edge

262
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,400
of volume. You do the ads and then all of a sudden you start like, it goes like a week and

263
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,280
you don't see anything. So if you want to be very, very, very, very conservative,

264
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:38,520
I would say 70 and above, as long as it's medium competition or less, you're good to go. But again,

265
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,240
if it's low competition, I think you could go as low as 50 and be pretty safe. But again,

266
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,560
there's variables. It's hard to just give a black and white. If there's no volume for the

267
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:55,000
ancillary keywords, that could be a red flag. If there's just all kinds of different little

268
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,640
tiny factors that you need to consider. So a couple of questions I want to address really quick.

269
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:07,240
Gina says, I know a city near us in Georgia, but there is not a great search volume.

270
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,360
Do you still go into it? I think she's referring to probably a city that's growing.

271
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,840
She said there's not great search volume. I think in that case, just like what you just said,

272
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,520
you can kind of get an age domain going, kind of make a long-term play, but you're probably not

273
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,920
going to see a lot right out the gates, even if you run ads, if there's not much search volume.

274
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:35,880
What are your thoughts? Yeah. It depends on your perception of that city, I think. So I've got a

275
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:42,280
city in Tennessee that is really small on the search volume numbers, do not look good. But I

276
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:47,080
know that that city is growing. I know that there are people moving there, that people want to live

277
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:54,840
there, that it's got a upward trajectory that is unmatched by any other city really in Tennessee

278
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:02,040
right now. So I put one there and that site kills it. It's doing great. So Gina, I'd say like, look,

279
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,360
it depends on the way that you build your agency and your own personal approach to

280
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,840
your risk assessment, right? Are you willing to see what happens if you put a hundred bucks

281
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,760
of ads into it? Because it could mean that you find something that no one else is looking at

282
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,800
and no one else is going to find. And if you do, that's a win, right? In my agency, I tend to go

283
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:25,080
for those things. I tend to just say, hey, let's try it out. Let's see what happens and experiment.

284
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:34,200
A lot of this business model I've found is try it, right? Just see what happens. And if it works,

285
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,280
you've got a winner. And if it doesn't work, at least now you know, and you're not going to

286
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:44,360
just always be wondering about it. Right. I think that's solid advice. Richard says,

287
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,080
for the main keyword question mark, what about the long tail keyword? I think we addressed that,

288
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,600
right? Maybe he said that before we got into it, but we kind of addressed that, correct?

289
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:59,960
Yeah. Yeah. I think it's helpful to understand why would someone search for a long tail keyword?

290
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:07,640
In your own search habits, why would a person search habits? Why would they search for a

291
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:14,120
long tail keyword? And think about if I'm living in Memphis and I want a concrete contractor,

292
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,200
I'm just going to search concrete contractor, right? Because I don't need to search. Google

293
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,000
knows where I live. It's going to pull up local search. If someone searches the long tail keyword,

294
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,400
concrete contractor in Memphis, Tennessee, they probably do not live in the Memphis area. So

295
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:38,360
they're looking from outside. Who looks from outside of a city? General contractors, builders,

296
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:45,560
investors, people that are looking to do projects in the city, commercial, people looking for

297
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:52,440
commercial work that manage a commercial facility in the city. So I found that if the

298
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,520
long tail keyword has search volume, it probably is a high growth area because it means that people

299
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,400
from outside the city who have money, who want to invest in properties in that city by doing some

300
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:09,080
kind of project related to that keyword are searching for it, right? That's kind of the

301
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:15,160
psychology behind long tail keywords that I found has been indicative of a growth area.

302
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,240
Okay, let's keep moving along. And guys, if you have any questions related to the search volume

303
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:30,280
topic before we get into more of the software side. By the way, I didn't even mention this

304
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:36,840
at the beginning, which is bad, but we're going to be, again, I said this at the beginning,

305
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,480
we appreciate everyone that did the beta stuff. We're like one month, our original deal, we gave

306
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:48,360
everybody two months of free beta, right? Was that what it was? Or two months of 20% off.

307
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,480
And anyway, we just appreciate that feedback. And I know we've implemented, you've implemented

308
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,400
quite a few of the changes already, haven't you, Ryan? Yeah. Yeah. So thanks to everyone that did

309
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,760
beta. Some of these are here. So Richard particularly has been super helpful. He submitted

310
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:09,000
a bunch of tickets. You guys, this is made by the people that do this business model. This isn't

311
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,040
made by some corporation that's sitting in Silicon Valley. This is made by people that are doing

312
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,840
rank and rent, people that are industry leaders in this area that have built agencies that are

313
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,240
successful, what works, what doesn't. That's how this tool was created. So we're continuing that

314
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,240
approach in the way that we build rank and rent engine, right? If you're a user and you're like,

315
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,720
hey, be cool if it did this, be cool if it did this. We have a feature request that you could

316
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,480
put in and that goes straight to my inbox. And I look at those and I'm like, you know what?

317
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,720
That'd be great. Let's do that. And then I just task out the developers and they go and they create

318
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,520
it, right? We add it to the product roadmap. So over the course of beta, we found edge cases

319
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,880
and things like that that were important for you guys to have it in the platform.

320
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,160
And we made those updates. And so it's been really, really useful. And part of the,

321
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,560
there was a discount for the first two months for people that were the early signups for beta.

322
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:12,360
And we really appreciate you guys. Yeah. Quick question, just a clarification, Ryan.

323
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:20,120
The people that did do beta, if they want to, are they able to tap into an extended

324
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:25,320
discount based on what we set up or do we have to, or is it just, is it done?

325
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,440
Yeah. If they've already made an account and they took advantage of the beta pricing,

326
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,040
that was for early access for the folks in the beta. And so they've got that.

327
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:41,320
We'll have deals and things like that in the future. They'll get access to things that come

328
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,400
out later on just as a gesture of saying, thank you. But they got locked into that early pricing

329
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:55,720
from the job. Also for you guys that are in this, we're going to make sure that we take care of you

330
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,160
guys above everybody. So just keep that in mind. And again, we just want to say we appreciate the

331
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:10,280
feedback. Okay. Bo says, okay, this one I'm going to read the question. You can give your feedback.

332
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,120
I'm going to give my feedback and I'm going to tell you what my answer is. But he says,

333
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,120
can you touch on CPC on Rare? Before I read the whole question, I'm going to let you know this,

334
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:29,480
Bo, is that I have a pretty solid answer because of course we're looking at this. There's another

335
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,400
question that's related to the backlinks. There's a couple different components of due diligence.

336
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:42,040
We're just making sure that we're dialed in. On the CPC, I'm at the same place I was a few weeks

337
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:51,080
ago with the search volume, which is I'm in, this campaign's performing well. How does it look

338
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:56,280
inside of RankinRen Engine? Okay. Now I can confidently say this is what it should be. So

339
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:05,160
I don't have a solid answer. Do this every time. Is it the average of this for you just yet? But I

340
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,920
just will answer by saying that's what I'm working on now. Now that we have the search volume piece,

341
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:17,160
now we're working on what the CPC should be according to Rare, as well as the backlinks

342
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,200
as well. So I don't know, Ryan, do you have anything else you want to add on that?

343
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:29,800
Yeah. I'd say that you're trying to get on the high top of page to get the most leads,

344
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:36,840
but it's not the end of the world if you don't. This goes back into like, this is a little bit

345
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,520
squishy, right? You're going to have to try it out. You're going to have to see what works for you.

346
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,800
And then see what kind of results that you're actually getting. So if I see a high top of page

347
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:51,400
bid that is like 20 bucks, I'm not going to even fool with it, right? But if I see one that's $10

348
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:57,320
and then the low top of page bid is $1 and it's averaging at five, I'm totally comfortable with

349
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:04,600
that, right? Because what I'll do is also run ads that are a little bit off hours as well. So starting

350
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:11,800
at 7.30 in the morning through, I don't know, 7 p.m. at night where others are not running ads,

351
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,440
I'm going to take advantage of that high top of page bid when others are not running ads. Maybe

352
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,720
there's end at 5 p.m. and mine runs until 7 p.m. I'm going to get cheaper ad clicks in that two

353
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,560
hour delta between those times. So there's strategies and tactics that you can deploy to

354
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:33,000
take advantage of the less expensive clicks. But I don't worry about the high top of page bid if I

355
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,720
think that on an average across my keywords that I'm going to do okay for my campaign forecasting.

356
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:48,600
Beautiful. So yeah, Bo, stay tuned. We'll have more details on that. I would rather let you know,

357
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:54,040
say that to you than give you some random answer. I have to come back and correct. So anyway,

358
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:03,240
so guys, that's search volume, okay? 50 on the low end, low competition, 50, medium competition,

359
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,800
70. If you want to be extra safe, do 70 and above. To be honest, if it's your first project,

360
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:16,200
maybe make sure it's 70 and above. But at the end of the day, guys, make sure that we're following

361
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,800
the exact recipe, right? I've given you the recipe of how to bake the perfect cake.

362
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,000
Can you deviate from it and still have success? Yeah, some of you guys have probably done that on

363
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,840
accident and still have success. And then you get in your head, oh my gosh, this is untrue, but

364
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,600
that's an anomaly. And we've done this a lot of times. I've lost a lot of money. I've made the

365
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,480
mistakes. So the closer you can get to the advice that we're giving you, it's because we've tried

366
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,440
it, we've tested it, and that is what we've seen to work. Can it still work if you deviate slightly?

367
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,960
Yes. But every time you deviate, you're running the risk of messing up that recipe that actually

368
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:59,000
works. All right. That is, I think, all the questions that we had so far on search volume.

369
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,760
We've nailed that. I know you guys have been waiting on that. If anyone has any clarifications,

370
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:09,560
keep going. Other than that, Ryan, why don't we open back the tool? I know last time,

371
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,920
I'm going to give you co-host, I know last time we literally only got to talk about

372
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:20,040
due diligence. We got to talk about the Explorer website, kind of do the metrics on that.

373
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,200
We didn't get a ton into the project stuff, the list of projects, the CRM, that kind of stuff. So

374
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:36,360
let me give you co-host real quick, sir. Let me see why this doesn't work. Hold on.

375
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:44,200
All right. Beautiful. Okay, done.

376
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,800
Cool. Fire it up. Where do you want to go with it? Where do you want to take this train today?

377
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:58,520
I just want you to give them a bit more. Last time when we talked, I always get hung up talking

378
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,720
and talking and talking about the due diligence, because to me, that's the easiest way that I could

379
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,600
just see how valuable this is, because that's how much time it took me to do due diligence

380
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,560
when I was coming up and doing them literally on sheets of paper. But there's so much more

381
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:20,840
that this does. I think more of the project management, show them more on what they can

382
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,160
do with the CRM, just some of that stuff, especially for the people that maybe weren't

383
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,160
on the call last time. I don't think we had a ton of people on the last time we did it. We

384
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:36,920
didn't promote it super hard because we were just doing a beta anyway. I think we could also talk

385
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,600
about the Keyword Planner, but let's just get into this. Guys, for those that have no idea what

386
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,560
that we're talking about, this is Rank and Run Engine. This is something that Ryan's been working

387
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:52,040
on for 15 months. It's the version 2.0 of what he's used to scale his agency. It's our go-to

388
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:57,320
standard tool that we are going to be using exclusively because it's getting data directly

389
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:02,440
from Google and because we can control it and we can give Ryan feedback and a host of different

390
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:08,840
reasons. It's super affordable. It's less than the price of a tool of it, like SEMrush, et cetera.

391
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,360
But that is what this is, and we're just going to be talking about that a bit today. For those of

392
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:24,760
you that did not get the beta code, you can message me and I have a code that you guys can use as a

393
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:30,520
launch code that you guys can access as well. If you were not part of the beta and you're

394
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,760
interested, message me. I'll send you a code. We can go from there. Ryan, let's go into some

395
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,040
of these different features, some of these different benefits that this tool has.

396
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:45,480
For sure. Let's talk about Bo's question. Bo asked about the difference between the low

397
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:51,800
top of page bid and the high top of page bid. This is Keyword Planner. We're going to do the

398
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:59,400
keyword masonry and we're doing it in Knoxville. You guys that are building your agencies need to,

399
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,760
one of the most important things you can understand about this keyword tool is some of them are going

400
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,880
to have local cities that are smaller. Some of them have DMA regions, which are much larger.

401
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,960
You can go into bigger markets sometimes if you know that your search volume is good and your cost

402
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:22,520
per click is really low. This is an example. Brick related things in the Knoxville area.

403
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,520
I'm not saying that this meets the population requirements. I'm not saying that it's low

404
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,920
hanging fruit. I'm just using this as an example to answer Bo's question. I had this pulled up.

405
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,400
He was asking about the difference with low top of page bid and high top of page bid.

406
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:44,200
Google's saying, hey, it's $1.43 per click for the low and $3.92 for the high. That's awesome.

407
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,200
That's a great keyword. Some of these, though, guys are more expensive. I'm going to do masonry

408
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,720
and masonry contractor near me. You can see that the difference between four bucks and $33 almost

409
00:39:53,720 --> 00:40:02,600
is pretty significant. There's other keywords in here that are going to be gold mines. Let me just

410
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:10,600
do bricks, veneers. This goes to Gene's question a little bit about building a good keyword list.

411
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:20,040
Look at this. 140 search volume and less than $2. Just because an industry has those really,

412
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:26,120
really high dollar amounts doesn't mean that it's not viable. You can find these keywords

413
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,560
that people look for brick veneers. That's a really high ticket service. You get to re-brick

414
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,720
a whole house with brick veneers and it's going to be really expensive. You can get that click

415
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:42,840
for less than two bucks. Until you and I talk, I didn't even know what that was.

416
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:49,560
If somebody's searching brick veneers, they are buying the service. They are in buy mode. That

417
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,720
means you've gone down the rabbit hole a little bit in your research. Am I correct in that?

418
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:01,560
Yeah, man. Yeah. They're looking for ... Brick veneers is a specialty brick service that

419
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,360
it's not a DIY thing, man. You're not doing DIY brick veneers usually unless you're

420
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,320
Bob Villa, right? It's just not happening. Another is tuck pointing.

421
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,920
Hold on. Is brick veneering just like doing veneers on your teeth? Do they whittle your

422
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,560
teeth down so you look like a gremlin and then they put the caps on?

423
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,800
Yeah. Yeah. They do that to your house. That's crazy, dude.

424
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,960
They put brick veneers on the outside of the house to give that timeless brick look. It's

425
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,200
really popular. You can see just on the search volume here how popular this is.

426
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,920
That's another money keyword that ... There's these variations here, right? Brick paneling.

427
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,080
People that search this don't know to call it brick veneers, but they know what it is.

428
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:50,120
Thin brick, brick veneers. You can see that even though if you do masonry contractor and you're

429
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,840
mean, it's 30 bucks a click. The people that are looking for brick veneers are looking brick

430
00:41:54,840 --> 00:42:00,360
paneling and these other brick-related overlay type keywords. They're looking for a masonry

431
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:06,680
contractor. You don't have to get totally hung up on, oh, it's $30. This isn't going to work.

432
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,600
This is just another way to search for that primary keyword.

433
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,840
I have a question, Ryan. Let's say that we were looking that up. Let's say we're in masonry.

434
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:22,200
We find out masonry is 30 bucks a click top, the high end. You're like, okay, I could go and target

435
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:29,080
terms like this on my ads. On your SEO side, would you still be targeting the term masonry

436
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:35,960
as your H1 on your page title, that kind of thing, or would you change that strategy at all?

437
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:42,760
100%. This is still going to be masonry near me. They're looking for a brick masonry contractor.

438
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,760
That's the expensive one. It's $18. It's a cost per click average. This is still what I'm targeting.

439
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:53,240
This is still my primary keyword. It's still going to my H1. It's still going to my landing page,

440
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,000
but if I run ads to it, it is probably not going to make the mix.

441
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:05,320
The reason I wanted to bring that up, guys, is that the thing that's interesting is when you see

442
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:11,720
high CPC, it's terrible for ads, but nothing's better than when you have organic

443
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,840
leads coming in for those high CPC terms. That usually means that they're very highly sought

444
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:24,120
after. The good strategy is get your clicks for the low cost terms, start ranking for the high

445
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:29,960
cost terms, and between the two, you have a freaking smasher of a website. It also looks

446
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:34,200
like the freaking hooptie of websites, the Geo Metro of websites while you're at it.

447
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,120
Yeah, absolutely. That's a great strategy. You're able to take advantage of these other

448
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,960
keywords that are overlooked. Let's see. Did I misspell that? Tuck, oink, ding.

449
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:51,080
Okay. Spelling is hard when I'm doing it live. All right. This one is another good example of

450
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,560
a keyword that between tuck pointing and tuck pointing near me and some of these others,

451
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:00,360
there might be 40 or 50 searches a month, but it's going to be super cheap clicks.

452
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:08,200
That's not a DIY thing. Someone's paying a mason to come out and do that. Be mindful of,

453
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,680
just because you see that high top of page bid doesn't mean that it's not a viable market.

454
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,000
Look for some of these keywords that they're looking for a specialist to do. They're just

455
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,120
not using the specialist primary keyword that has that high cost per click.

456
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,800
Gina had a really interesting suggestion. I don't know if you want to wrap up this thought,

457
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,000
or if you're done, but maybe you could show ... You don't have to show a full,

458
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,240
but maybe we could pick a niche and you could show us how you go about building a keyword list

459
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:43,960
using rank and run engine, coming up with ideas, seeing what's highly searched,

460
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,680
that kind of thing. I don't know if that's something you could show us.

461
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,440
Yeah, dude. Let's do it live. What do you got? Give me a niche. What do you want to do?

462
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:58,520
Let's stay away from the regulars, but let's keep it still. Let's ask Gina. Gina, what do you got?

463
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:05,400
Give us something that's not concrete, tree service, spray foam insulation, and we'll do it.

464
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:12,920
If it is one of those, then let's keep going. I love those niches. I still make money in those

465
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,520
niches. We're still closing deals in those niches, but I guess I'm just a little tired of talking

466
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:24,760
about concrete, personally. It's only because I've been doing it for three years. I'm still

467
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:29,720
going to do it. I just am tired of talking about it. I love some demo.

468
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:36,280
Yeah, exactly. If you're watching this car right now, demo, I've got some demo clients and they do

469
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,680
not bat an eye at $1,500 a month. They don't think twice about it because the demo jobs,

470
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:48,200
entry-level demo jobs are high ticket, but they'll get jobs that are like,

471
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,640
I had a demo job come in for one of my clients that was a quarter million dollars.

472
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,880
Crazy. Yeah. Let's do some demo. Let's do demo.

473
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,080
Just to answer Gina's question really quick, she says, are we not using the Google Trends?

474
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:08,520
No, guys. We want to see how Ryan's using this to build his keyword list. Remember, we're redoing

475
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:15,400
the training 3.0. In the meantime, you can still follow everything the exact same. The training is

476
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,680
still how I build my keyword list. You got to remember, this tool just came out three,

477
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:27,960
four weeks ago. I'm still taking my strategy using how I used to and then how am I going to

478
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,680
use it here, looking at what Ryan's doing. But no, for anybody that's confused, just keep following

479
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:37,320
the training. It still works as how I've continually made thousands and thousands of dollars, but we

480
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:44,920
want to see how Ryan's using Rare because we want to utilize and just beat the heck out of this tool

481
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,320
as much as possible if we're going to have it. Let's do demolition and let's build a keyword

482
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,280
list. But anyone else that's confused, keep doing what you're doing. This is just to see how Ryan's

483
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,560
doing. This could also be a good way to generate additional ideas if you're hung up trying to find

484
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:05,400
and build that keyword list. Let's see how you do it, man. Yeah, 100%. Guys, we're showing you a

485
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:15,880
part of the keyword analysis process, Nick, and the training starts with Google Trends.

486
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:20,200
You can look at the national, are we in the right ballpark for the cities we're looking at?

487
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:27,000
That's very similar to talking about the chat GPT approach, looking nationally at what our

488
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,880
search volume is. We're a little bit further along in that part, and we've got some areas

489
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:38,680
that we're looking at now. This is not removing that part of the training. That's still essential,

490
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,720
but we're just zoomed in a little bit here. Let's say that we see demolition is trending

491
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:49,400
in Tennessee, and demolition is interesting, guys, because there's only so much real estate

492
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:55,720
in a city, and there's only so much good real estate in a city. If there's old properties that

493
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:02,360
are in a blight district or there's an area that is growing, but there's old properties there that

494
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:08,600
people are buying up, they have to demolish those old properties to build new ones. It's required.

495
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:15,240
There's only got so much space. Demolition is a really, really good one to go into. I'm a big fan

496
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,880
of demolition. Demolition, let's do Tennessee. Let's just see what happens with some Knoxville.

497
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,520
Just already in here, so let's just search it and see what happens.

498
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,520
You guys can see 260 searches, probably three bucks a click.

499
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:45,480
3F357 for demolition. Let's see what happens. That's more expensive. Demolition companies near me,

500
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:54,600
though, is a good one. That's six bucks. What I'll do is I'll go through demolition-related

501
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:59,880
keywords, demolition, demolition contractor, demolition company, demolition services,

502
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:08,360
and I'll start looking at what these look like. As I build up my keyword list, I'm going to have

503
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,360
my core, my primary keyword is going to be demolition or demolition contractor,

504
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:18,440
and then I'm going to start adding these in as part of my core keyword list. It's also going

505
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:23,400
to depend on what my vision is for this actual site. Do I want other services related demolition,

506
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:30,600
because demolition guys will often also do excavation and trenching. It just depends on

507
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:35,320
how you want to eventually build out the site. If you're wanting to just specialize in just straight

508
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:41,240
up demolition, there's a lot of good keywords here that when you add all these up, there's

509
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:47,160
probably another 100 or plus or more searches per month in this market just for demolition.

510
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:54,200
Let's do another city. Let's do some nationals growing. These are bigger areas, but you can see

511
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:59,480
that there's a lot of opportunity in these areas. Six bucks a click, six bucks a click,

512
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:10,120
demolition companies near me. I will go and I'll build up my keyword list by looking at the primary

513
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:15,160
keyword, making sure that it's got solid search volume standards that Nick and I talked about a

514
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:22,280
second ago. Then I'll add in all these additional ones as part of my secondary keyword list where

515
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,920
these are not primary, but they're variants of the primary. When you add all these up,

516
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,640
you're going to get calls where other people are not optimizing for these keywords, and you're

517
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,120
going to get the call for house demolition companies near me or pool removal contractors,

518
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:42,920
because the guys that do demolition will also do some of these specialty services

519
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,080
related to demolition. You can add these in commercial demolition contractors. That is a

520
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:54,840
great keyword, and people are probably not looking for it. Build these out right into a sheet,

521
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:00,040
and just add these in, or I'll go straight to my due diligence tab and I'll make a due diligence

522
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,040
record where I'll add in these keywords that I see coming up over and over with good search volume.

523
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:08,280
Yeah, what's up, Nick? I know a couple of different ideas that I would find this,

524
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:15,400
but for somebody that may be asking, let's say that Gina thinks of a brand new service. She's

525
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:24,280
like, I'm going to go into excavation or demolition. How do you go about finding out what's the main

526
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,240
keyword? Do you just go off of what it's called and use your intuition and say, well, if it's

527
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,800
excavation, it's probably excavation. Let me look at the difference between excavation and

528
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:39,400
excavation contractor, excavation company. How do you determine that main keyword? I'm curious

529
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,400
how you do it. I'll let you guys know how I would do it and how I would find it really quickly.

530
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,840
Yeah, I would love to hear Nick's answer to this. I think this requires just a little bit of

531
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,040
speculation, but making just sort of informed guesses. For example, there's a difference

532
00:51:54,040 --> 00:52:00,520
as in industries. If I just type in concrete, that is not going to give me the results that I want.

533
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:07,480
If I just do straight up concrete, if we just use a tried and true example, there's 1900 searches,

534
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:13,880
but that's not what I want because people are going to use that to find ready mix and delivery

535
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:19,000
by the yard or whatever. But if I do demolition, and I know this because I've had campaigns that

536
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:28,920
run ads and I've seen my organic clicks, demolition is likely going to, you can't buy just a demolition

537
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,960
product. You know what I'm saying? It's not a product and a service. It's an action. It's a

538
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:41,080
service. You're doing demolition. Now, what do they mean by that? Do they mean interior

539
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:47,000
remodeling demo? That's very different than destroying a structure, removing it away,

540
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,400
and then clearing the land. That's going to be more likely to be a demolition contractor.

541
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:58,120
But in this case, that keyword or demolition company is a good one. In that case, I will look

542
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:06,760
at the keyword and I will make a judgment about, okay, this is not a product. Concrete is the

543
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:15,400
product, but it's also a keyword that is going to be used in concrete contractor. I want to make

544
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:21,400
an assessment about whether this is going to be likely someone calling for someone to do this

545
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:27,080
specialty service. In this case, demolition would be one that I would add. A demolition contractor

546
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:33,240
very often would add that to. Concrete would not add that. Concrete contractor would be a great

547
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:38,680
one. It varies by industry. I just really make a judgment call about really what the search volume

548
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,360
looks like and how I would search for it, frankly. What would you do, Nick?

549
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:50,040
I would be lazy and just tick-tapping other people's work. I'd go to some major cities,

550
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:55,640
type in what I think it is, type in demolition. I'd look at the top three results in the organic,

551
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:01,000
and I would look at the page title because those guys most likely are paying SEO companies. Make

552
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:07,480
sure it's big cities, competitive cities, Atlanta, L.A., whatever. I guarantee the page title, the

553
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:13,080
thing that shows up in the SERPs, the first word or the first two words is going to be demolition

554
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,480
service, demolition service. That would be an interesting one to look at right there, demolition

555
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,040
contractor. I would look at three, four cities and then I would come up with two, three ideas.

556
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:27,640
Then I would go pump it into RankinRent engine and I would see which one. Again, this is just when

557
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,080
you go into a new niche. This is why it's so important to stay in the same niche because

558
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,600
concrete, me and you, we can just go off the top of our head and know our keyword list.

559
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,280
I'm curious to see what demolition service is.

560
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,920
It's going to pull up 10, but let's do a bigger...

561
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:56,200
So it's going to pull up these related keywords and there's...

562
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,800
And that's just to generate ideas. I would go in and do that in like three, four cities and I'd

563
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:04,680
look, okay, I keep seeing demolition service, I keep seeing demolition contractor and then I would

564
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:09,480
just look at that inside of this tool and go, all right, this is probably my target keyword.

565
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:15,400
You could also go to the website, look at the H1, look at the page title, that kind of stuff

566
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:20,200
right there. Full service demolition. Is that a Legion?

567
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:21,880
I don't know, man.

568
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,840
It almost looks like it, but then it's, I mean, it's kind of got a brand. They did a good job

569
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:33,560
with it is. So again, these are just some ideas, but once again, this is the reason why you guys,

570
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:39,000
if you go and you take the time to learn a niche, you don't have to keep... There you go.

571
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,960
That's a Legion site.

572
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,600
Yeah, we've built that for one of my students.

573
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:45,960
Oh, there you go.

574
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,040
This is a lead generator in Atlanta and you can see that he's made it in, right? So look how...

575
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:58,920
Then that's a good looking site. Go up again, it's best demolition service.

576
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,840
Oh, you're looking at the...

577
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,680
The headline, yeah, right there. Demolition contractor, sorry. Yeah, that's another good

578
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:13,320
thing. If you could find a lead generator, it doesn't necessarily mean they know what

579
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,600
they're doing, but usually they know what they're doing more than everybody else. And if they're

580
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:21,720
ranking, they probably know what they're doing. So these are just ideas. You could also ask in

581
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:28,120
the group if you want. That's another idea, you know? But these are just when you're going

582
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,120
into a new niche. And I just wanted to bring that up because she asked to build a keyword

583
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:38,760
list from scratch. So again, guys, you could stick with how we do it until I'm continuing

584
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:44,840
to do it, but I might, based on this, now that we're using rank and run engine, the version 3.0

585
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:50,360
might have a slightly different way that we do it if it's faster, if it's more accurate, et cetera.

586
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,560
So that's why I was curious to see your process.

587
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:59,880
Totally, man. Yeah, it's great being on this call with you guys. Looking at the

588
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,200
the fundamentals and constantly revisiting the fundamentals. I think that there's a lot

589
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:08,120
of entrepreneurs that are very, very successful that I listen to that talk about, you know,

590
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:13,240
revisiting your business model from first principles over and over and over and over again,

591
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,200
right? Because there's people that are not doing that. They're getting left in the dust because

592
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:22,280
the world changes, search changes, search volume changes. And I love that Digital Landlords is

593
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:27,320
always thinking about like, how do we make sure that we're going to consistently get results for

594
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,360
students? It's cool talking about this with you guys today.

595
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,600
Gina, just to clarify Gina's question before we end this, she said, I'm just a little thrown off

596
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,120
by her searching for it, I guess. Do you always search for Tennessee or do you choose a large

597
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:43,800
city? I think it kind of goes back to the whole concept of like, people are people are people.

598
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,600
The thinking with the Google Trends is that you can kind of cast a wider net.

599
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:56,600
And so I think for now, I still like the, let me ask this, can you search on rank and

600
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,920
rent without putting in a city and just go globally or nationwide? Or do you have to put

601
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:06,280
in a city? It's made for local search. Okay. So maybe what you could do, Gina,

602
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:13,800
to start to start to get ideas is just use trends to find those main terms and then come

603
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,240
into rank and rent in the city you're looking at and then start going from there.

604
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:23,160
Yeah. Yeah. I think, again, let's talk about earlier, like we were zoomed out

605
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,880
and we were looking at trends, we were talking about JetCheap ET and prompting it for search.

606
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:33,880
And then we zoom in the next part and we look at, you know, at the city level, right? The state

607
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,840
city level and see like, okay, what is it actually? We know what the trend is and saying, hey, here's

608
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:43,480
the trend, but what is in reality, right? Because we got to make a decision about whether it's a

609
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:49,640
Bible market based on the very specific data as we have it for that area. Yeah.

610
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:57,720
Yeah. Anyway, beautiful. Well, Jahil just joined and then Corey helped him out. He said 50th low

611
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:04,200
competition. If you want to be very conservative, Jahil 70 is the very bottom of the list if you

612
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:13,000
want to be very conservative. But, you know, this is what we found right now. As we roll out version

613
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,520
3.0, I'm going to keep testing. I'm going to keep looking at this. Now I can go into rank and rent

614
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:24,200
engine, refresh it and see if anything changed right before I release it and see if those numbers

615
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:32,760
are any different. But as of right now, standing November 5th, 2024, 50 with a low competition

616
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:39,240
and 70 with a medium competition. And that is that. So I also want to just mention one more thing.

617
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,960
I do appreciate, I see those of you that post your wins and share your success and everything,

618
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:49,320
I know it takes time. But I know, I don't know about you, Ryan, but when I was in these groups,

619
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:54,360
like just learning the ropes, dude, I would feed off of these posts. When I saw people, even if

620
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,960
they just got their first lead in, they just got their first website up, they just, you know,

621
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:03,800
sometimes hearing about somebody's like failure even gave me encouragement. Like, hey, I just

622
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:07,800
cold called this business owner. I got kicked in the teeth and whatever. So anyway, I just want

623
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,480
to let you guys know, I really appreciate you guys sharing those wins in this group and the free group

624
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:16,760
and that it's complete social proof. It helps us a ton. And just to want you guys know that I

625
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:23,720
noticed that. So anything else you want to add, Ryan? Thanks for having me on, man. I am always

626
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:30,440
happy to be with you guys and Digital Landlords. I love this group and I agree with what Nick said.

627
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:37,800
You know, I think that I have my failures. I have, you know, to get to $87,000 a month was a bumpy

628
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:44,680
road. I screwed up so many things, made so many mistakes, got told no so many times, lost Bo's.

629
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:51,000
This is part of what we do, right? Like you're going to have success look like this, you know,

630
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,040
and it's fun to watch people getting closes and wins and things like that. But behind every one

631
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:01,960
of those, there's no's and there's, you know, people that are, you know, laser focused and

632
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:07,320
don't give up and then they post their wins. So it's fun to be on this journey with you guys. And

633
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:12,680
I'm glad to be on the call today. Well, Ryan, appreciate you, bro. And guys, again, for those

634
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:20,920
of you that did not get the beta discount, if you guys want to give RankinRant Engine a try with,

635
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:25,800
again, just for, just so everybody knows, you do not have to use this tool. It is just the tool

636
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,520
that I'm going to be using exclusively. You're going to see it at the training. You're going to

637
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:34,280
see me referencing it in every single aspect of this because we actually have Ryan who can control

638
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,480
this tool. But you don't have to use it. If you guys want to, you know, throw some stuff together,

639
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:44,040
use the sheets and the whole deal, I did that. But what I'm telling you is from experience,

640
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:49,720
it's better to just start and build a proper foundation and scale it up than throw together

641
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:54,920
a duct tape business and try to retroactively fix it. That is very, very difficult. It's so

642
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,120
much easier if you build it from the ground up, you have your projects lined out, you have your

643
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:02,040
tasks lined out, you have your freaking due diligence. It's all in one place. You log in,

644
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:07,240
boom, boom, boom. You have one tool you need, done. But again, I don't want anyone to feel like they

645
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:11,160
have to. But if you guys are interested, message me. I have a coupon code for you guys. Those of

646
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:16,360
you that didn't get the beta discount, we have something for you. And with that said, we'll see

647
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:22,520
you on the next call, Ryan. Cool. Thanks for having me on. Go close and flash. Go get some deals. It's

648
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,760
only freaking Tuesday. We got time, man. It's Tuesday morning for you guys. We got time to go

649
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,760
sling some freaking deals this week, man. By the way, let me mention one more thing.

650
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:36,360
Today's Election Day, everyone's kind of been weird because it's like, I don't know what's going

651
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:41,560
to happen. Well, hopefully after today, maybe by Saturday. I know I was reading earlier, like

652
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:49,400
the George Bush Al Gore one took a couple weeks. But it seems like after this, whatever happens,

653
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,640
people at least have some clarity. And I feel like that things start to become a little bit normal,

654
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:58,840
at least until the holidays. And then it gets a little weird. But I know that the economy's weird,

655
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:04,360
people are uncertain. So I'm super optimistic because no matter what, people are always anxious.

656
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,680
After today, tomorrow, this week, we should start seeing things normalize a little bit. So

657
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,920
I'm kind of looking forward to that. A hundred percent. A hundred percent.

658
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:16,360
Okay guys, talk soon. Appreciate it, Ryan. Thanks for having me on, man. See you.
