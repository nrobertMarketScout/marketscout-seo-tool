1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
You get to the end of the call. Everything's good

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,120
Business owners like you're like, yo, I just need a credit card, you know, he's good to go. Oh, yeah

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,160
Um, I don't do credit cards. I'm just gonna send you a PayPal

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,240
I'm sure you take out the PayPal, right?

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,480
And I know I've been I've been like it's been a while but I know a couple years ago

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,620
I would have said yeah, I guess that's okay. He'd send me a PayPal

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,840
You know what you should say and what you're gonna start saying is like no, I don't actually don't unfortunately you could say it

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,840
However, you want but unfortunately, I don't take PayPal credit cards the only way I'm not gonna be chasing you around

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,880
I got too many people I'm working with this is too my time is too valuable and so is yours

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,220
I got to keep a credit card on file. That's a deal breaker. I apologize. I gotta keep a credit card on file

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,320
Scariest shit to say right but I promise you they'll respect you and if they're actually sold they give you the credit card

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,520
Period. I have a guy I kid you not have a client right now

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,400
that he signed a deal before the New Year and

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,920
I said I he signed it we're good to go and I sent him a credit card authorization and he said hey

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,840
Can I just give you my bank account and dude? I have I hate bank account stuff because then on stripe when the payment declines

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,080
It's this whole thing and it takes a while to get paid. I just don't like it. I

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,520
Want to get paid today. I said we don't take we don't take bank account. Sorry, and I kid you not

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,520
I walked away from that deal. I

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,160
Literally told him that like I can't take anything besides a credit card period and

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,880
It took another four weeks almost a full month of

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,240
Me I just I wouldn't take it and it took four more weeks before I finally got his credit card

22
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,520
He went to the bank and got a card

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,800
Just so he could pay for leads. Okay, so he wasn't bullshit. I thought he was lying

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,340
He's like I don't have a credit card for this business. I want to put under this business

25
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,940
He wouldn't got a credit card because I just my time is too valuable. I'm not gonna mess with it

26
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,680
So that's an example people are gonna ask. Hey, you know, I don't I don't like giving out my credit card

27
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,140
can I just give you my PayPal or

28
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,860
Or this one you get more often. Yeah, I don't I don't want to have my credit card on file

29
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,500
Can you just send me the invoice?

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Wait, will you just send me the invoice? Sorry? I got a itch on that

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,180
Well, you guys just send me the invoice every month and I'll just pay it now. Sorry. We just have it

32
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,740
This is how I respond so are we just have it in our system automatically like keep in mind

33
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,860
I'm doing this with 50 60 companies. I can't go in and do this every single month

34
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,820
So I I'll send you the first one as the invoice, but after that it's gonna automatically bill cool

35
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,760
Cuz then what happens is that once they fill in the information, it's gonna lock their card and file and I just I'm straight with them
