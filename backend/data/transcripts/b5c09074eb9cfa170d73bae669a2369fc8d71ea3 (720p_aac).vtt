00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
Beautiful. So guys, welcome to the call. Welcome to the art of digital real estate. I don't

00:08.320 --> 00:15.840
know how many lives we've actually done. But one thing I want to point or I want to just

00:15.840 --> 00:22.520
let you guys know is I mentioned this a few weeks, even months ago. I think I just mentioned

00:22.520 --> 00:27.320
casually in a post, but the this group is going to be changing. I'm not going to give

00:27.320 --> 00:33.480
too many details, but it's as you see it now is not how it's going to be for long.

00:33.480 --> 00:36.400
Not trying to scare anyone, not trying to do any of that, but it is going to change.

00:36.400 --> 00:40.760
One thing that we've learned again and again and again, and you guys need to remember this

00:40.760 --> 00:46.640
as well, that is when people don't pay for things, they don't value it. I've been given

00:46.640 --> 00:52.760
access to a program that it costs. I was just talking to Aaron about this. I was given access

00:52.760 --> 00:58.760
to a program that cost $30,000 just to join. And it's a couple thousand dollars a month.

00:58.760 --> 01:03.440
And I have full access, right? Like top tier access. And I have literally watched like

01:03.440 --> 01:09.920
10 to 15 minutes of content and I have access to content that's worth $30,000. But because

01:09.920 --> 01:13.720
I didn't pay for it. And by the way, the reason I got access is I was trying to check. I was

01:13.720 --> 01:19.760
I wasn't looking at the content itself necessarily. I was looking at how it was structured. But

01:20.120 --> 01:25.640
needless to say, even at that level of content that's that valuable, they're able to charge

01:25.640 --> 01:31.600
that kind of money. I'm not even like taking advantage because I didn't pay for it. So

01:31.600 --> 01:37.280
that said, guys, we are in the process of making some massive changes. And so if you

01:37.280 --> 01:43.800
guys pop on to this group in the very near future, but a.k.a. before the first of the

01:43.800 --> 01:50.280
year and it's very different or it's not here or whatever, that's that's why. But in

01:50.280 --> 01:55.960
the process of doing that, I went through and I looked at how many lives we've done.

01:55.960 --> 02:00.680
And Francesca, how many how many hours of content do you think we have in this group

02:00.680 --> 02:04.520
that people some people take a lot of advantage of? But how many hours would you think that

02:04.520 --> 02:07.520
we have in here?

02:08.000 --> 02:14.560
I'll tell you an estimate. Let's go like this. Let's see.

02:19.120 --> 02:24.800
I don't even know if we can calculate the amount, but like literally we've got, yeah,

02:24.800 --> 02:31.040
like thousands and thousands of hours, like ridiculous amount of content. So anyway,

02:31.760 --> 02:36.400
that's it. Just you guys have an idea on that. But anyway, Francesca, welcome to the call.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.480
Good to have you on. Thank you.

02:40.320 --> 02:43.520
We are going to be doing a quick little announcement. It's it's going to not take

02:43.520 --> 02:46.560
a ton of time, but I do want to make sure that we got as many people as possible.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.840
So I appreciate the 15 of you guys that are on. We're going to keep this post live

02:49.840 --> 02:57.440
for other people to see it. But what we would like to do as we transition for two reasons,

02:57.440 --> 03:04.720
as we transition away from the current group as it is, and as I sat here and reflected on

03:04.720 --> 03:08.720
the fact that we've been doing this for over three years, like three years and some months.

03:09.440 --> 03:13.360
What we decided to do and we did this, we've only done this one other time,

03:13.360 --> 03:15.680
and this will be the only other time that we do it because the group's going to be changing.

03:15.680 --> 03:21.280
But we are going to be doing a scholarship like we did, you know, it's like two, three,

03:21.280 --> 03:24.480
four months ago. I don't even remember when that was. Was that three months ago, two months ago?

03:24.480 --> 03:27.600
September, I think. September, we did something similar.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.280
This is going to be slightly different. But what we're doing, we're going to be doing this.

03:31.600 --> 03:38.880
It's like we're calling it the thousand days of renting shitty websites. It's the celebration

03:38.880 --> 03:42.240
of a thousand days of running shitty websites inside of this group. We've been doing this over

03:42.240 --> 03:46.880
three years. This group and I've been going live every single week up until recently when I realized

03:46.880 --> 03:53.680
that there weren't people taking full advantage. But anyway, in celebration in kind of as we

03:53.680 --> 03:58.960
transition this entire group, it's been freaking awesome. I've loved every second of it and it's

03:58.960 --> 04:01.360
still going to continue. It's just not going to look the same and it's not going to be

04:02.560 --> 04:09.200
free 99 anymore. We're going to be doing a scholarship. OK, so what this entails is if

04:09.200 --> 04:14.000
you would like to, we're going to post a link and we have a couple of questions. You click on the

04:14.000 --> 04:17.360
link and basically you're going to tell us why you think you deserve the scholarship. What the

04:17.360 --> 04:22.000
scholarship is, is it's going to be full access to digital landlords. It's a hundred percent free.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.920
Like we're going to. So to be very clear on this, we're going to be giving away one

04:25.920 --> 04:32.080
full scholarship where we are going to be giving somebody inside of this group that applies

04:32.080 --> 04:38.000
completely full access to digital landlords, to the community, to the trainings, to the curriculum,

04:38.000 --> 04:44.400
to the support, to the scripts, to all, to everything, even the premium stuff like our

04:46.800 --> 04:50.640
premium sales library. They're going to get access to everything, access to me.

04:50.640 --> 04:54.720
We're going to be doing that in this group. So Francesca just barely dropped the link.

04:55.360 --> 04:59.040
You click on it. I don't know. There's like a few questions, like 10 questions. A lot of them,

04:59.040 --> 05:03.600
though, are like name, whatever phone number, whatever. Just click on it, fill it out. Francesca,

05:03.600 --> 05:07.840
I think I can pin it. Let me pin it really quick. OK, I just pinned it. If you guys would like to

05:07.840 --> 05:12.320
apply for that, go ahead and click the link, apply for it, give us full answers. We try to make it

05:12.320 --> 05:16.480
as short as possible, but also we really want to give it to somebody that's deserving. Our last

05:16.480 --> 05:20.080
winner is that we've only done this one other time. Our last winner was somebody that we felt

05:20.080 --> 05:26.160
was very deserving, that really had their heart in the right place, that just couldn't do it.

05:26.160 --> 05:33.200
Why am I carrying myself? Can you hear me? Yeah, it was me because I commented it doubled played.

05:33.200 --> 05:38.400
Oh, OK, I was like, why? No, you're good. You're good. So anyway, guys, if you would like to apply

05:38.400 --> 05:43.200
for that, go ahead and click it. Now, what we did last time and we'd like to do again is there's

05:43.200 --> 05:48.720
only going to be one winner of the full scholarship on the actual application for this scholarship

05:48.720 --> 05:52.880
there. I think there's a question that says if you're not selected for the full scholarship,

05:52.880 --> 05:57.680
would you be interested in entering into a partial scholarship? Last time we gave away a handful of

05:57.680 --> 06:04.880
partial scholarships to allow for a few additional people into the program. Now, it's still they still

06:04.880 --> 06:09.520
had to pay. It wasn't completely free, but we did do some partial scholarships. So when you're

06:09.520 --> 06:14.240
filling this out, if you are interested, if you don't win the main one, if you're interested in

06:14.240 --> 06:18.000
potentially a partial, which we're probably going to give a handful, two, three of those away,

06:18.000 --> 06:23.680
then click that box. But if you click that box and we do select you as a partial scholarship,

06:24.560 --> 06:28.880
just please answer the phone if so, because we don't want to be chasing you around. We don't

06:28.880 --> 06:32.560
want to waste our time and we don't want you to say, yes, I'm interested in possibly in a partial

06:32.560 --> 06:36.640
scholarship. And then, you know, we give it to you and not somebody else and all that. So

06:37.200 --> 06:43.360
that's all. Anything else I'm missing? No, I think you covered you covered it.

06:43.360 --> 06:47.760
Yeah, it's simple. Click on the link apply. It's it's going to take you guys like two,

06:47.760 --> 06:52.640
three minutes. And again, we're doing this. This would be our last one that we do. It's our second

06:52.640 --> 06:58.000
and last one that we do. And we're doing it in celebration of 1000 days of renting shitty websites,

06:58.000 --> 07:03.760
which, of course, you guys know, it's it's it's funny. Okay, don't don't don't laugh or don't make

07:03.760 --> 07:06.800
don't don't get mad at me calling it shitty websites, because a lot of my websites are shitty.

07:06.800 --> 07:12.960
Most of my websites are shitty. And also, partly because we're transitioning into a completely new

07:12.960 --> 07:17.360
model than a free Facebook group where people could just sit here and not consume the thousands

07:17.360 --> 07:22.960
of hours of content that you guys haven't taken advantage of. So go ahead and apply at that link.

07:23.600 --> 07:31.360
And let's do this. So let's see, what else do we have? Do you want to go over the questions from

07:31.360 --> 07:35.920
the post from yesterday? Let's do it. Let's start with that. We're going to start with going over

07:35.920 --> 07:41.120
the questions from the post from yesterday. I'm going to drop the link to Zoom for anyone that

07:41.120 --> 07:46.800
wants to hop on. Guys, this is a chance that you have to jump on, ask me a question directly. If

07:46.800 --> 07:55.280
you are, first of all, Francesca will tell you I'm the most chill guy ever. Yeah, you should

07:55.280 --> 07:59.840
there's an I don't buy whatever. I do get a little bit excited sometimes. That's the only thing I can

07:59.840 --> 08:04.160
get a little bit excited. That's true. Right. That's a good thing, though, I think. Yeah,

08:04.160 --> 08:07.840
no, it's good. It's good energy. But I can get a little I can get a little bit snappy, but not at

08:07.840 --> 08:12.800
anyone that's not working directly with me. So Francesca has to deal with that. Not you guys.

08:13.840 --> 08:17.040
OK, I'm going to drop the link and then Francesca, let's pull up the questions. Let's start going

08:17.040 --> 08:24.480
through it. And I think we should also give some stuff away. I agree. I agree. I just barely,

08:24.480 --> 08:31.920
which for the record, I have been I mean, it's it's I mean, I guess I hate to say sounds bad,

08:31.920 --> 08:36.480
but I guess I started the company and I realized the other day I was talking to Kyle on the call

08:36.560 --> 08:42.160
and Kyle had on that like super comfy black hoodie with the with the red badge.

08:42.160 --> 08:46.080
And I was like, dude, I don't even have that hoodie. So guess what I did? I had to text Ashley

08:46.080 --> 08:49.760
and I was like, yo, can I get a code so I can get the hoodie? Francesca, do you have the hoodie?

08:49.760 --> 08:53.120
I was going to say I don't have the hoodie. I'll sell it. I'll sell it to you.

08:54.160 --> 08:58.880
I'm just kidding. Francesca, I'm going to let you be the first winner. Text Ashley

08:58.880 --> 09:02.560
and go ahead and get yourself the hoodie. It Kyle swears. I haven't even touched it.

09:02.720 --> 09:07.440
We have different sizes. Of course we have different sizes. It's you just you just order

09:07.440 --> 09:11.840
your size. It comes right directly to your house. No shipping, nothing free. Boom. I pay for it.

09:11.840 --> 09:17.600
OK, so text. So just to start, Francesca is our first winner of the hoodie.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.880
We're going to give away some stuff today. We got the T-shirts. We got the mugs. We got

09:20.880 --> 09:27.840
the air pod cases. We got the I have Rubik's cubes, but I don't that might be a little bit

09:27.840 --> 09:33.040
difficult. I might even have one here. Let me see. You brought it to your hotel room?

09:34.080 --> 09:37.760
Yeah, they're sick. You know, I brought it for a gift. I'm meeting a friend

09:39.120 --> 09:43.840
that is super interested in this model. So check these things out, guys. I don't want

09:43.840 --> 09:49.520
to open this yet, but can you see this? We got the Rubik's Cube. I gave away these away on Halloween

09:50.480 --> 09:54.480
and I thought they were going to be like because I ordered so many or like five,

09:54.480 --> 09:57.840
six hundred of these. I think I ordered 650. I thought they were going to be like really

09:57.840 --> 10:03.280
crappy quality, sticky, sticky, whatever. Dude, these things slack, man. These things.

10:03.280 --> 10:07.520
I'm tempted to freaking think I should open it just to show you guys. I have to.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.600
Can you do one? My son can. My son was teaching me how.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.160
Anyway, pull up the question while I show you guys how smooth this is.

10:14.160 --> 10:20.320
Yeah. So like, look at this one hand. I mean, these these are I don't I don't want to mess it

10:20.320 --> 10:25.280
up because it's so pretty. But I mean, dude, these these are pretty, pretty smooth. I was

10:25.280 --> 10:30.400
pretty pleased with the quality of these little cubes. So let's see. Let's see what we got.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.120
We got the T-shirts. We got the sweaters. We got the Rubik's Cube. We got the mugs.

10:33.120 --> 10:38.320
We got the mouse pads. Yeah, I think we're going to be doing the beanies as well.

10:38.320 --> 10:42.080
So let's give away some stuff. Let's answer some questions, do some live coaching.

10:42.080 --> 10:48.480
You guys apply for the scholarship. Today is a great day to be in digital real estate and let's

10:48.480 --> 10:51.360
get into it. So Francesca, what do we got? Let's answer some questions here.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.480
We have Donnie asking if you're starting a fitness program.

10:55.680 --> 10:59.040
Shut up, Donnie. And then we have.

10:59.040 --> 11:03.440
OK, Donnie, Donnie, Donnie Dre, watch your mouth. I'm kidding. No, I'm not starting a

11:03.440 --> 11:09.120
fitness program, but yeah, we have anything to say. Go ahead.

11:09.680 --> 11:14.080
No worries. I don't know if I'm saying the name right. So I apologize. Aleda.

11:14.720 --> 11:19.680
OK, what's the question? Do you think the Google Ads for local services

11:19.680 --> 11:24.720
would impact negatively your system? Isn't that what we do?

11:26.240 --> 11:30.480
Yeah, I'm trying to read this over and think. Is that so? Let me let me pull up the questions

11:30.480 --> 11:33.920
too, because maybe I'll read it a little bit differently just because a different set of eyes.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.600
For sure. Pull it up. Is it on the?

11:36.400 --> 11:42.080
It's in the post where you're in the ocean. And by the way, guys, I do want to apologize

11:42.080 --> 11:47.280
really quick that for yesterday, I'll take that. I was on me. I was running late.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.640
I decided last second to come down to Vegas and I was already going to be a little bit late.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.840
So I was going to have Francesca set up the live and it literally wouldn't.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.720
I know it probably sounds like it was an excuse. It would not load.

11:56.720 --> 12:00.080
We could not get we couldn't stream it and we wanted to be able to record it.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.720
And we just wouldn't load. Aaron tried it. Francesca tried it.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.720
And I tried it in multiple locations.

12:07.440 --> 12:12.160
We do apologize. I hate I hate. Yeah, wasting people's time. So I apologize.

12:12.160 --> 12:17.440
So we'll make it up for you today. OK, so let's go through. I'm looking real quick.

12:19.040 --> 12:22.800
All comments. Let's go through these. And I also dropped a link. Looks like we've got somebody in

12:22.800 --> 12:27.360
the OK, let's let's answer this question first. Then we'll get into the questions on the post.

12:27.360 --> 12:32.080
This is Ravella from Newark, Delaware. Hold on.

12:36.720 --> 12:42.880
OK, can you hear us? Rev, I'm going to call you Rev.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.040
OK, you got to unmute. Hold on.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.920
OK, there you go. Can you hear us? Hi. Hey.

12:56.160 --> 13:00.400
How are you? I'm so good. Do you say it Ravella? Do you say it Ravella?

13:00.400 --> 13:04.400
How do you pronounce it correctly? It's Ravella.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.480
OK, amazing. So what's your question? Let's let's get into it.

13:08.480 --> 13:15.360
I am so sorry. I just wanted to say hi. Oh, amazing. That's even better. Hi.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.960
Glad to have you in the group. Let's do this really quick. How long have you been in the group?

13:20.720 --> 13:28.240
I've been a participant in about six months. My boyfriend, he's very involved in your group

13:28.240 --> 13:37.440
and he loves you and Nick. So amazing. Or Porter. Yeah, amazing. Well, who doesn't like Porter?

13:37.440 --> 13:41.520
I'm a little bit harder to do more of an acquired taste, but I appreciate it. Tell him.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.400
Can I ask you a question? Yes, that's why we're here.

13:46.400 --> 13:50.560
Maybe this has come up before, but like, is there where did you start?

13:50.560 --> 13:54.240
Like, what groups did you start in when you first got started? I mean,

13:55.200 --> 14:05.360
so when I originally started, this was back in 2016. I listened to a podcast and I heard about

14:05.360 --> 14:12.160
this idea that you can rent these little websites and I just like hooked me. I think I've told this

14:12.160 --> 14:17.680
story a hundred times, but it hooked me and I really wanted to do this. So I started doing

14:17.680 --> 14:21.840
exactly what I hope everyone does that's on this call, which is I tried like, you know,

14:21.920 --> 14:25.360
on the podcast, he was, he was given some examples. This person was like,

14:25.360 --> 14:29.680
you're going to buy, you know, build a site, blah, blah, blah. I didn't know anything about anything

14:29.680 --> 14:32.800
and started doing it. And as I started getting into it, I'm like, oh my gosh,

14:32.800 --> 14:37.200
there's a million questions. So that's when I was like, okay, there's got to be a quicker way.

14:37.200 --> 14:42.400
Let me see if there is. And that person that did that podcast, they had a program and then there

14:42.400 --> 14:47.280
was next. Every single program out there that's on the subject of rank and rent, I have been,

14:47.280 --> 14:51.920
I'm in or have purchased like with the exception of probably the most recent ones that have cropped

14:51.920 --> 14:56.800
up in the last two years, but yeah, you name it. I've got it. I've been in them all. And a lot of

14:56.800 --> 15:01.920
them have really, most of them have really good things. I just always felt like there was a

15:01.920 --> 15:06.800
missing piece and the missing, the missing piece for me was the fact that you had to wait to rank

15:06.800 --> 15:11.760
the website. That was the part that I couldn't wrap my head around. I'm like, how can I scale

15:12.320 --> 15:17.680
if I have to wait for this website to rank? So, but I have nothing bad to say about any of these.

15:18.320 --> 15:24.560
The only time I don't really appreciate it is when people, you know, they don't even know how to do

15:24.560 --> 15:28.080
it themselves. They haven't made any real money and then they start teaching on it. And it's like,

15:28.080 --> 15:32.160
how can you, it's like being somebody that's giving financial advice, doesn't have any money,

15:32.160 --> 15:36.800
right? Or the gym trainer that's overweight, like whatever. So anyway, yeah, I'm in all of them.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.800
And I give credit to all of them as well, because I've learned stuff from all the people out there

15:40.800 --> 15:45.360
that you can think of. I would recommend them all for different things, but I think the missing

15:45.360 --> 15:50.160
piece for me in my mind, and I think the only way to do this is by renting first and then ranking

15:50.160 --> 15:56.320
later. Thank you so much. You're a true inspiration to us. Yeah, you're awesome. Thanks, Rev. And when

15:56.320 --> 16:03.600
we make this transition to something different inside this free group, keep an eye out, okay?

16:04.480 --> 16:05.280
Okay, thank you.

16:07.920 --> 16:13.120
Okay, let's start going through some of the questions. And thanks to Rev for jumping on.

16:13.120 --> 16:17.920
If anyone else wants to jump on, see, you can even keep your camera off and it's not a big

16:17.920 --> 16:24.320
deal. Okay, can't bite through the camera. All right, why did the, where did they go? Where did

16:24.320 --> 16:28.240
they go? Where did they go? All right, Francesca, it looks like I'm gonna have to read these.

16:28.960 --> 16:34.640
Um, do you want me to read them? No, I got them. I think just because that one. Okay, so we've got,

16:34.640 --> 16:41.120
uh, yeah, yeah. I think I know what she's talking about, but I'll let you read it again.

16:43.680 --> 16:48.480
All right, I'm just looking through, you know, what's funny as I'm looking through is I, and

16:48.480 --> 16:51.680
that's something I want to point out. I'm going to get to the questions too. I see Donnie Dre,

16:51.680 --> 16:56.160
you're going to start a fitness program as well. I need some games, dude, freaking, freaking Donnie

16:56.800 --> 17:06.320
Dre. I love it. Okay. So a lot of people just commenting in 2025 to keep it posted. I apologize

17:06.320 --> 17:12.160
people saying, is the event happening? I'm so sorry. Okay, I see it. Aleta, she says, my question

17:12.160 --> 17:17.600
is the following. Do you think the Google ads for local services would impact negatively your system?

17:19.760 --> 17:25.920
She's talking about the, I think she's talking about the new Google guarantee ads to turn them

17:25.920 --> 17:31.760
on. You need to have, you need to provide more, more stuff than we usually normally would like

17:31.760 --> 17:37.520
your business license, stuff like that. Yep. And they do, they are at the very top. So she's saying,

17:37.520 --> 17:42.880
do you think, you know, the, yeah, so, so here's my opinion on it. This is just my opinion. One,

17:42.880 --> 17:52.000
one humble man's opinion. Uh, I believe that if you can run them, then you should. And if you

17:52.000 --> 17:55.200
have to get a whole bunch of extra information, then it's, I don't think it's worth the time.

17:55.200 --> 17:59.200
It's kind of how I feel about WordPress, right? And I'm, I know I'm not, I haven't completely

17:59.200 --> 18:01.680
answered the question, so I'm not, I'm not done yet, but I'm just going to give you an example.

18:01.680 --> 18:06.960
People always ask, do you need to use WordPress? Do you need to learn WordPress? No. If you know it,

18:06.960 --> 18:11.920
then is it better than Weebly? Yeah, I think so. It's got more, it's got a lot more capability.

18:11.920 --> 18:16.320
You can do it for cheaper, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But for you to go and learn WordPress,

18:16.320 --> 18:19.280
the time it's going to take you, the, the attention, the time, et cetera,

18:20.160 --> 18:24.800
you're way better off spending that time focusing on getting better at getting money,

18:24.800 --> 18:27.600
at getting people to give you money, at getting better at sales, at getting better at due

18:27.600 --> 18:31.520
diligence. It's not worth learning the skill, but if you already have it, you can. So I think my

18:31.520 --> 18:37.440
opinion is the same on this and anything else that crops up is like, should you go and make,

18:37.440 --> 18:43.200
you know, can I still, basically it's like, can, can you still be successful even if you can't run

18:43.200 --> 18:47.120
Google guarantee ads? And the answer is, of course you can, of course you can.

18:47.200 --> 18:50.640
Will it help if you happen to have the business license and the business owners consent and

18:50.640 --> 18:54.880
whatever else you need to run them? Of course, do it, run it. It's great. Just like if you can

18:54.880 --> 18:59.680
get a GMB, of course it's going to help, but it's not going to, it's not a deal breaker.

18:59.680 --> 19:04.160
And that's just my opinion. But again, I just have my opinion on everything is I always, I'm,

19:04.160 --> 19:09.040
I'm a, I'm like, I feel like I'm a problem solver. And those things don't scare me.

19:09.040 --> 19:13.760
I remember when I first got into the game back in 2016, people, they were running,

19:13.760 --> 19:18.480
you guys know they were running Google guarantee ads in some of these big cities back in 2016.

19:18.480 --> 19:22.560
And everyone has spooked to death. Oh my gosh, Google is going to take over lead generation.

19:22.560 --> 19:26.800
Is lead generation still going to be around? Blah, blah, blah. The sky's falling. It's in 2016.

19:26.800 --> 19:30.400
And I think I was just too dumb to even worry about it. I was like, well, if that happens,

19:30.400 --> 19:34.000
I'm going to make a little bit of money until it changes. And I just kept going and going and

19:34.000 --> 19:38.480
going. And here we are millions of dollars later. And yeah, they're still running Google guarantee

19:38.480 --> 19:42.400
ads and we're still making money doing lead generation. That's my opinion.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.560
What do you think Francesca? Did you have any other questions on that?

19:46.560 --> 19:51.760
Yeah, no, I agree. And also like to think that Google would completely remove any type of other

19:51.760 --> 19:56.640
ads when we're like their primary customer, that would mean they're not making any money.

19:56.640 --> 20:00.160
And I think everyone is money oriented. So if Google is making money with us,

20:00.160 --> 20:03.120
they're not going to get rid of something that's producing cash.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.840
I think, I think if they could run, if they could run their own,

20:07.280 --> 20:11.680
they could do lead generation that could replace Google ads. And yeah, I think they would do it all

20:11.680 --> 20:17.040
day long. It's capitalism. But I think you're right. I think that, I mean, they're, they make

20:17.040 --> 20:20.320
money a lot of ways. They have a lot of products. They have a lot of different services, but the way

20:20.320 --> 20:25.200
that they're, from what I understand, don't take this as, you know, don't, you could fact check me

20:25.200 --> 20:32.400
and tell me I'm wrong, but I've heard one of their largest, largest revenue streams is Google ads.

20:32.960 --> 20:37.040
And it makes sense, right? How many thousands I've personally spent one and a half million

20:37.040 --> 20:44.800
dollars plus, you know what I mean? So, okay. Ismail Hunaid from Pakistan.

20:46.880 --> 20:52.480
2025. I am very confused in selecting a niche. Could you give me three niche ideas that can give

20:52.480 --> 21:04.720
me 2K USD? Secondly, kindly guide me niches in UAE, please. 2K USD. I'm guessing he's talking

21:04.720 --> 21:11.440
about per month. But this is, go ahead. No, I think so too. I'm not going to give,

21:11.440 --> 21:14.240
here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to do something that's going to help you more

21:14.240 --> 21:17.040
in the long run. You may not like it in the short run. I'm not going to give you the niches,

21:17.040 --> 21:20.560
but I'm going to give you this advice. And I'm going to tell you that all you need to do,

21:20.560 --> 21:25.920
Mr. Hunaid, is you need to just reverse engineer. You need to look at, okay, if I can charge,

21:26.480 --> 21:33.360
for me to charge $2,000 a month, the business owner has to be netting at a minimum. They need

21:33.360 --> 21:37.360
to be making probably three, right? They need to be making at least three because they're not going

21:37.360 --> 21:41.840
to, or four. They need to be doubling their money safely. Let's say four. And that's in their

21:41.840 --> 21:45.920
pocket. So then you have to start going, okay, well, what niches are they going to be able to

21:45.920 --> 21:51.680
charge enough money and close just a handful of deals where they can make that kind of money?

21:51.680 --> 21:54.720
And so then you could start reverse engineering. You can start looking, but basically the answer

21:54.720 --> 21:59.600
is you need to go into the bigger ticket stuff. Okay. And then there's a fine line where you don't

21:59.600 --> 22:06.880
want to go too high of ticket because if you go too high of ticket, like for roofing or solar,

22:06.880 --> 22:14.800
which has huge ticket stuff or remodeling or some of these other freaking competitive niches,

22:15.520 --> 22:20.720
then you attract the big dogs. Then you attract the national companies that are spending budgets

22:20.720 --> 22:24.400
that are insane. Then you're attracting companies that have marketing companies within them

22:25.200 --> 22:29.360
just to do their own marketing. Okay. So that's my opinion on that.

22:30.080 --> 22:37.200
And then on the UAE, that one I am not going to speak on because I am in the process of testing

22:37.200 --> 22:41.040
some stuff right now. And we've been, Francesca, we've looked at a couple of niches. We've done

22:41.040 --> 22:46.480
some deep dives on some niches in the UAE. We're going to be releasing some of our findings,

22:46.480 --> 22:52.320
whether it's on, inside of digital landlords, potentially on YouTube. I'm not really sure,

22:52.320 --> 22:54.560
but we're going to keep that in the back pocket just in case. Okay.

22:55.440 --> 23:04.320
So that is what I would say on that. Okay. So Chris says, that's my thoughts. Will AI destroy

23:04.320 --> 23:09.840
lead gen with Google search changing it in some way in the future? Well, you don't know for sure.

23:09.840 --> 23:15.120
You take the money on the table while it's there until it isn't. I have the same opinion on AI.

23:16.080 --> 23:20.800
Rather than being scared of it, I'm stoked. The reason why is because as long as you're a

23:20.800 --> 23:26.640
problem solver, then all I think of AI is it's going to help me, right? It's something that I

23:26.640 --> 23:32.160
can use. And guess what? If it shakes up the entire game, then fortunes are going to be lost,

23:32.160 --> 23:36.480
but fortunes are going to be made. And as long as I'm somebody that's willing to put my head down,

23:36.480 --> 23:41.440
get to my desk, turn off the distractions and learn and stay ahead of the game,

23:41.440 --> 23:45.200
and I'm not somebody who wants to just remove myself from this game, then I'm going to be good.

23:45.200 --> 23:48.400
In fact, it's going to be exciting. In fact, there's going to be tons of opportunities. So

23:48.400 --> 23:52.880
that's where my thoughts on anything new that comes. It's like, you should be excited. It's

23:52.880 --> 23:58.800
an opportunity, right? Whenever there's blood on the ground, whatever that quote is, there's

23:58.800 --> 24:06.240
great opportunities as well, okay? So great point, Chris. And Rev says yes as well. Okay,

24:06.240 --> 24:14.320
so what I think I'm going to do actually is I'm going to go into, Francesca, if you see any other

24:14.320 --> 24:20.800
questions pop up, let me know. Sorry, it's not a question, but Kevin, I know you mentioned you're

24:20.800 --> 24:25.200
disappointed in the announcement, but I do want to say like, we're building something that's going

24:25.200 --> 24:34.640
to be better than this. So be excited. Wait, who said that? I'm pretty sure. Kevin in the comments.

24:35.840 --> 24:41.200
Where's Kevin at? Underneath the live. I'm not mad. I just, I'm curious. I just want to see

24:41.200 --> 24:44.320
which Kevin. Kevin Koparski.

24:47.760 --> 24:52.240
Oh, I only recently discovered this model and group. So I'm slightly, oh yeah, he's,

24:52.240 --> 24:56.080
okay, that makes sense. Yeah, he's disappointed because of how it's changing. So Kevin, yeah,

24:56.080 --> 25:00.320
basically what we're going to be doing is take advantage while you can. We're not, nothing's

25:00.320 --> 25:07.200
going away today. That doesn't mean it couldn't go away tomorrow, but I want you to know that like,

25:07.520 --> 25:12.080
I promise you when you pay for something, you value it more. There have been people that have

25:12.080 --> 25:18.080
really, that have really taken advantage of this group, but the amount of people is just a handful,

25:18.080 --> 25:23.440
right? Like I think once, once the, the access to this group is no longer, I think people are

25:23.440 --> 25:29.520
really going to see how much value we really provided because it's going to be insane. What

25:29.520 --> 25:35.760
the heck is calling me? Wild. So yeah, don't be, don't be bummed about it at all. Just keep your

25:35.920 --> 25:40.720
eyes open. And in fact, Kevin, send me a message, send me a private message and I'll give you some

25:40.720 --> 25:48.000
recommendations and help you out. Like our goal here is to add value. And it's just, it's a shame

25:48.000 --> 25:51.760
that people don't take advantage of things that are free, but it's just human nature. And I was

25:51.760 --> 25:56.320
just telling you guys, like this, like I said, Francesca, it's like, even me, I've got access

25:56.320 --> 26:02.160
to this like incredible information that is probably worth, you know, probably more than

26:02.560 --> 26:09.600
$50,000. And I'm not even taking advantage because it didn't hurt. I didn't cost me anything. And so

26:09.600 --> 26:14.000
I don't have any skin in the game. And so therefore, it's just how it works. And so anyway,

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
it's, it's going to be a good change. You should be excited. You're right. And it's going to allow

26:18.000 --> 26:25.040
us to give even more. It's going to, it's going to be, we have 6.2 thousand members of this group

26:25.040 --> 26:30.320
right now. There's probably, every time I pop on, there's like 500 people that are active, like

26:30.320 --> 26:34.240
always, every time I jump on, I see like 500 people that are active. So it's, it's pretty good

26:34.240 --> 26:39.440
for a Facebook group, but there's probably half or 4,000 people that join this and they're no

26:39.440 --> 26:42.640
longer interested or they're not serious or they're not doing anything with information. And so my

26:42.640 --> 26:48.640
goal is to take the 6,000, 6.2 thousand and find the 500 that are interested, the 500 that are

26:48.640 --> 26:55.680
always online. And I want to freaking give you guys immense value to get you closer to your first

26:55.680 --> 27:01.600
deal to get you further in the process. And obviously then eventually when you guys are ready,

27:01.600 --> 27:06.240
you can join us inside of digital landlords. So that's the goal. And so anyway, I don't want

27:06.240 --> 27:09.440
to give too much away because we're still kind of working through it, but just so you guys know,

27:09.440 --> 27:12.720
take advantage while you can. I'm super stoked that we have a bunch of people on this call.

27:12.720 --> 27:17.280
And if you guys have questions, please let me know. I just saw that I missed some stuff earlier.

27:18.240 --> 27:25.120
Chris had scholar me. I love that. Let's see. Corey McNeil, my buddy, Corey. Corey McNeil,

27:25.120 --> 27:29.600
what is going on? Can I hire you for one on one? No, you cannot, sir. But I would love to give you

27:29.600 --> 27:35.360
a phone call and I owe you a phone call. So I am in Vegas. I'm actually doing some filming this

27:35.360 --> 27:41.680
weekend, locking myself in a hotel room, doing some filming, but I am around next weekend. So

27:41.680 --> 27:48.960
if you're still on this call, sir, give me a text. And also I would love to gift Mr. Corey McNeil

27:49.440 --> 27:57.280
with some swag. If he takes me up on it, I'm going to say swag winner message at fix it,

27:58.400 --> 28:08.720
fix it Felix. Actually, I'm going to say message Ashley. Sorry. Okay. For the code and Corey,

28:10.880 --> 28:15.920
your pick on what you want, sir. Appreciate you. Corey is one of the smartest dudes I know,

28:15.920 --> 28:22.160
by the way, on a lot of topics, but especially on SEO. Corey says he's in Salt Lake City. Okay.

28:22.160 --> 28:28.480
Amazing, bro. Text me. Okay. Anything else that you saw? That was something that you saw you wanted

28:28.480 --> 28:35.200
to mention real quick, right? Anything else, Francesca? No, I'm looking. I don't see anything

28:35.200 --> 28:40.800
else. What I'm going to do is this. I'm going to do two things. I'm going to go through,

28:40.800 --> 28:45.440
I'm going to try and clean up any of the posts that we've had in the last maybe week

28:45.440 --> 28:48.640
by answering those questions. Obviously seeing if anyone wants to come on live and ask me a

28:48.640 --> 28:50.800
question. Guys, you have an opportunity right now. If you want to come on live,

28:50.800 --> 28:54.480
if you want to just say that's completely fair. You know what I learned though? This is a little

28:54.480 --> 29:00.560
trick I want to teach you guys is if you want to get somebody's ear, if you want to get somebody's

29:00.560 --> 29:05.440
attention, go and find out what they're paying for, go and find out what's important to them

29:06.080 --> 29:12.240
and go and buy it or show interest in it and you can get their attention. Let me give you an example.

29:12.960 --> 29:22.720
I have been trying to get a hold of this guy. I think he's so captivating. I want to hire him

29:22.720 --> 29:29.520
to do some stuff. This is a guy online. He's got about a million followers. Dude, you can imagine

29:29.520 --> 29:36.560
how many DMs. These have come recently. He's blown up recently. You can imagine how many freaking

29:36.560 --> 29:40.400
DMs this guy gets. I was an idiot at first. I DMed him like, dude, I want to hire you. How much would

29:40.400 --> 29:44.880
you charge me to do this, this and this? Whatever. Nothing. Crickets. I hit him like six times and I

29:44.880 --> 29:48.560
was like, dude, what the heck? How can I get this guy's attention? I started thinking, I'm like,

29:48.560 --> 29:53.360
all right, what does he do? I started going down his thing. I found out this guy had a,

29:54.960 --> 30:00.480
he had like an info product, right? And part of the info product is you are part of this group

30:00.480 --> 30:05.520
that you can like, whatever, you're part of this community with him. So I just went and bought his

30:05.520 --> 30:11.200
thing. It's a, it's a monthly thing. It's like $50 a month. And as soon as I bought it,

30:11.760 --> 30:18.720
I sent him a DM, like within the first two hours and got a response like that. And I said, hey,

30:18.720 --> 30:22.800
I sent you a message on Instagram. I want to hire you for something. Can you check it?

30:22.800 --> 30:28.240
And he responded within 30 minutes. So anyway, just a little hack. And the reason I'm saying that is

30:28.240 --> 30:32.960
if any of you guys are like, I know some of you guys hit me in the DM with these ideas and stuff

30:32.960 --> 30:36.720
like that, it's like, dude, you got to be a little more strategic than like the old, can I pick your

30:36.720 --> 30:42.640
brain? Okay. And by the way, I'm not act, I'm not trying to seem like I get hit up like 17 times a

30:42.640 --> 30:48.400
day or whatever. I'm not trying to act cool or whatever. I'm just saying that, you know, anyone

30:48.400 --> 30:54.400
gets hit up, but it's very annoying that people expect you to give, give you their time. You know,

30:54.400 --> 31:00.480
like I used to be that guy that was like, Hey bro, you know, Hey sir, I would love to pick your brain

31:00.480 --> 31:04.880
and take you to lunch. And what you don't realize like nobody even at certain levels, people don't

31:04.880 --> 31:08.480
even go to lunch like that. They just have the lunch delivered to them. They don't go and like

31:08.480 --> 31:13.360
chop it up for lunch. Okay. So, and the people that did say yes to me, I'm so grateful for them

31:13.360 --> 31:17.200
because I know how annoying it is. So anyway, that's just a little side note. So I'm going to

31:17.200 --> 31:22.160
go through again. I'm looking at all these, I'm apologizing again and again for all these people

31:22.160 --> 31:27.440
that were looking for the link yesterday and we couldn't do it. I'm so sorry. So let's see,

31:28.160 --> 31:37.680
uh, let's answer this question. Ching Chia Wang said the following. Okay. I have a roofing,

31:37.680 --> 31:41.680
I'm going to go through this one. By the way, guys, if you want to hop on, hit the link,

31:41.680 --> 31:46.160
come talk to me. If not, we're going to keep going. I have a roofing client who paid me USD

31:46.160 --> 31:50.640
$3,200 per month in March and April this year, then dropped off due to his father's illness,

31:50.640 --> 31:54.880
then came back and paid me about the same from June to August, then dropped off in mid August

31:54.880 --> 31:59.920
due to him wanting him being too busy. Now he messaged me on Friday asking if I have a spot

31:59.920 --> 32:03.760
for him. I do not want to take him on again because he does pay, but I don't like the fact

32:03.760 --> 32:08.480
that he treats my service as something that he can just opt in and opt out of at will. Okay.

32:08.480 --> 32:12.880
So I, this is a huge message or a huge post. I actually didn't see the whole thing, but basically

32:12.880 --> 32:18.880
I think he's just asking for advice. Have you seen this post? No. Okay. So basically he's asking

32:18.880 --> 32:23.200
what, what he should do. I think if I'm misreading that, but it's like three times longer than that.

32:23.200 --> 32:27.520
I thought it was short. That's why I opened it up. What would I do in this situation?

32:28.480 --> 32:35.760
Well, first and foremost, I don't hate money. I do like me some money and I there's, it's hard

32:35.760 --> 32:41.520
for me to say like, even if somebody, I don't know at that amount of money, it's tough,

32:41.520 --> 32:49.200
but what I would recommend is that you just need to at this point, put this person in a contract,

32:49.920 --> 32:55.040
right? Like even if it's lower and I don't know, it says paid me USD. Like, I don't know if that's

32:55.040 --> 32:58.800
a flat fee deal. If that's a flat fee deal, then the solution is really easy. Be like, yeah,

32:58.800 --> 33:02.240
I'll work with you, but you got to give me a minimum commitment. Otherwise I'm working

33:02.240 --> 33:05.920
with somebody else. Like that's, that's it. And if he says no, then you just don't work with him.

33:07.760 --> 33:12.800
Yeah, exactly. I have a contract in place that way he can really just get you. And I would always

33:12.800 --> 33:17.680
have a contract in place no matter what, even if they're, you know, someone that you trust and

33:17.680 --> 33:22.800
they've never quit just because you never know. Yeah. Especially winter time. You never know when

33:22.800 --> 33:27.120
stuff's going to happen. All of ours, all of our clients, we try our best to make sure that no

33:27.120 --> 33:31.040
contracts come out during winter. And if they're approaching, if it's approaching winter and they're

33:31.040 --> 33:34.960
month to month, or they're like almost out, Francesca and I are like, we got to get this

33:34.960 --> 33:39.040
person back in a contract. Like, what do we got to do? Like, we got to make sure they're very,

33:39.040 --> 33:45.840
very happy. Go ahead, go ahead. Yeah, sorry. I know in this case, like he doesn't even have

33:45.840 --> 33:50.640
the excuse of saying, well, I need to test it out. Like he has tried it. He came to you. He wants

33:50.640 --> 33:58.720
more. So you really have all the power in your hands at that point. Yep. 100%. And also guys,

34:00.240 --> 34:05.760
at some point, like you just have to have some, you just have to draw a line in the sand

34:07.040 --> 34:10.640
and nothing is more empowering than when you don't need the money.

34:11.040 --> 34:15.440
And even if you need the money, but you make it seem like you don't need the money,

34:16.160 --> 34:21.360
you'd be amazed how much more people want to work with you. When you're willing to walk away,

34:21.360 --> 34:28.160
I'll give you a quick example. I've got somebody that, I've got somebody right now that's,

34:28.160 --> 34:34.720
that's a friend of mine and he is joined. He's, he wants to join our program. He wants to join

34:35.120 --> 34:41.120
he wants to join digital landlords. He's again, I've known this guy for a long time and

34:42.720 --> 34:49.840
he's asked me about five different times about joining. He, I mean, he knows everything. He

34:49.840 --> 34:54.320
knows what the commitment is. He knows how long the learning curve is, how much it costs to get

34:54.320 --> 35:01.920
in all this different stuff. And I think it frustrates him to no end that I will never,

35:02.080 --> 35:06.160
I do not try at all to sell him. In fact, if anything, I try to push him. What the first

35:06.160 --> 35:11.840
time that he called, he said, he said, so you're going to, I want you to sell me on your program.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.800
And I was like, I'm not going to sell you on my program. I don't, I don't say, I said,

35:16.800 --> 35:19.680
I don't really even like working with people. I know that much because a lot of pressure for me,

35:19.680 --> 35:24.240
which is actually true. Francesca knows this. And I said, I think you should actually, I said,

35:24.240 --> 35:28.800
you know what you should do? I said, go into the free group and go and try to do this yourself.

35:28.800 --> 35:32.560
And I said, the reason why I know I don't want to be rude and I'd love to earn your business, but

35:33.200 --> 35:38.560
I want you to go and see what it's like to do it on your own without my help so that you appreciate

35:38.560 --> 35:46.080
me when you come back. And my point with saying this is that because, yes, I want his money.

35:46.080 --> 35:52.160
Of course, I'm not allergic to money. And, you know, of course a part of me wants to be like,

35:52.160 --> 35:57.360
dude, let's wrap this thing up. Like, why don't you do this? But it's so, it feels so good when

35:57.360 --> 36:02.240
you know that that person wants to work with you, but you, you don't need the money.

36:02.240 --> 36:07.280
And so you get to retain your pride and you get to say, you get to almost push the deal away.

36:07.280 --> 36:13.840
And the more you push it away, the harder it comes at you. It's this funny thing about life.

36:13.840 --> 36:17.440
It's about, it's like the moment you stop caring is the moment it comes.

36:17.440 --> 36:23.040
So get to a point mentally. And it's hard in the beginning because every dollar, I remember

36:23.120 --> 36:27.440
my first deal, my towing deal, I did everything wrong. Like I, the only thing I did right was a

36:27.440 --> 36:32.480
flat fee, but I let them do a, a paper check, which gave them all control. And Francesca,

36:32.480 --> 36:34.960
we're dealing with this with one of our clients right now. It's so annoying, right?

36:35.920 --> 36:42.240
Yeah. Oh yeah. And when you, and if this set up expectations as well, at the very beginning,

36:42.240 --> 36:47.600
when you act like you matter and you know, you're putting those boundaries, it goes along ways

36:47.600 --> 36:52.160
long-term too, I've noticed. Cause when you're loose at the beginning, then they just think they

36:52.160 --> 36:56.720
can kind of do whatever they want in other aspects of the deal. They can hit you up on,

36:56.720 --> 37:02.480
you know, a week and night or whatever it may be. But it does like, it does set up also a standard

37:02.480 --> 37:09.120
for the rest of, you know, the deal that you're going to work with them for, not just the beginning.

37:09.120 --> 37:12.640
A hundred percent, a hundred percent. So anyway, that's just a little thought. That's something

37:12.640 --> 37:16.400
I've learned. That's about, it's like, and I've learned this in every area of life. It's like,

37:16.400 --> 37:20.640
it's for those people that are out in the dating game, it's the same thing with that. Like the

37:20.640 --> 37:24.080
second you stop caring, the people that are just chasing, chasing, chasing, they never get anything.

37:24.080 --> 37:29.440
It's the people that have options or seem to have options that get more options. It's just weird how

37:29.440 --> 37:33.120
it works. So be that way, be that way with business, be that way with your business owners,

37:33.120 --> 37:40.320
have a no fear of loss mentality without trying to be too hype up type of a guy. Yeah, it's,

37:40.320 --> 37:43.840
a lot of this is just mental stuff. So, okay, let's give away, I want to give away some swag

37:43.840 --> 37:46.240
really quick and then let's get into some more. I'm going to keep going through the,

37:47.120 --> 37:50.000
through the, what's it called? Questions? The posts?

37:50.800 --> 37:56.640
The posts. Yeah. Okay. I do see a few though, real quick. So, let's do some, let's do some swag.

37:57.760 --> 38:02.560
Corey McNeil. Okay. He DMed me. I'll send him my number. Okay. Corey, great. But Corey,

38:02.560 --> 38:05.840
you need to get some swag, bro. Especially if you're in Salt Lake, you need to, you need to

38:05.840 --> 38:14.000
get something to represent the digital landlords badge. Okay. Fino says, knowing what you know now,

38:14.000 --> 38:17.280
if you just found out about this business model three days ago, what's the first move you're going

38:17.280 --> 38:24.400
to make? Oh, we just did a live on this two days ago. How to make your first 750. You know what

38:24.400 --> 38:28.640
I'm going to do? I'm going to recommend Francesca while I'm going through these questions. Can you

38:28.640 --> 38:35.600
go over to Spotify, go to the podcast episode, episode, how to make your first $750 of, in

38:35.600 --> 38:40.320
digital real estate, $750 a month in passive income with digital real estate, whatever it's called,

38:40.320 --> 38:48.240
and, and reply with that link for Fino. Yes. Okay. So, I have a podcast episode on this exact topic.

38:48.240 --> 38:51.360
You can also do it on YouTube, but I think, well, if you want to do it on YouTube, you can find it

38:51.360 --> 38:55.680
there, but Francesca, get him the Spotify, the podcast episode that we did. I think it's podcast

38:55.680 --> 39:01.200
episode number like 11. I found it. Where is the question? What post is it in? Or I can. No,

39:01.200 --> 39:05.760
it's right here on the feed. It's right here on the feed. Fino, Fino asked that. Okay. Okay. Perfect.

39:05.760 --> 39:11.600
From Olympia, Washington. Okay. Sean Ryan. Hey, I'm in the paid group and I've been struggling

39:11.600 --> 39:16.000
to find a solid city for concrete and tree service. Is there a better way than just manually

39:16.000 --> 39:24.080
grinding through the city's list of cities off like a state database? Okay. Sean, great question.

39:24.080 --> 39:27.920
You know what I want you to do first? Or before you forget it, I want you to go and I want you

39:27.920 --> 39:32.320
to post this inside of digital landlords, because I would love to answer this question and have

39:32.320 --> 39:35.760
other people weigh in as well. Number one thing that I'm going to recommend to you

39:36.880 --> 39:42.480
is in this, like you have no idea how much time to save me. If you're not already, you've got to go

39:42.480 --> 39:50.080
and use rank and rent engine. That is going to save you so much freaking time. I have done so

39:50.080 --> 39:55.680
many due diligence in my life, guys. I could have freaking learned how to do this a long time ago

39:56.240 --> 40:01.680
or in a million other things. By the way, solving a Rubik's cube, it makes you feel like a genius,

40:01.680 --> 40:06.080
just so you know. I did it once. My son showed me step by step. Imagine my 11-year-old son.

40:06.080 --> 40:09.920
And when I finished it, I felt so smart. So just a little hack for those of you that don't feel

40:09.920 --> 40:20.560
that smart all the time. Yeah. Yeah. That's all I have to say. Okay. Francesca.

40:21.600 --> 40:29.920
Yeah. I'm posting that. Oh, you're making me hear myself. Oh, God. Okay. Is it gone?

40:29.920 --> 40:33.440
Yeah, it's gone. Sorry. There's no way for me to really prevent it.

40:34.080 --> 40:39.200
It's all good. Okay. I'm going to give a little bit of swag away. But anyway, so

40:40.960 --> 40:46.320
Sean, post it in the free, post it in the paid group, use rank and rent engine. But other than

40:46.320 --> 40:53.760
that, like go into the training, by the way. And it sounds like I'm not giving you the answer,

40:53.760 --> 40:58.160
but like I would rather teach people how to find their own answers than just give it to them.

40:58.160 --> 41:01.520
Because if I teach you how to find your own answers, number one is you're going to get

41:01.520 --> 41:07.040
better at that skill set. But number two is you're going to remember it better. So like,

41:07.040 --> 41:10.400
I think you've probably noticed on this stream, I've tried my best to like, not just

41:11.200 --> 41:16.560
spoon feed you the answers. And Sean, I want to make you a 25,000 per month type of person.

41:16.560 --> 41:22.640
It's a really good question. And I will answer it in detail for you inside of digital landlords.

41:22.640 --> 41:27.280
But I would recommend that if you would just use the rank and rent engine tool,

41:27.280 --> 41:30.480
it will save you so much time because you can just pop the city. And the only thing you need

41:30.480 --> 41:34.000
to do is find the competitors, which you can do really quickly. And it's going to find the back

41:34.000 --> 41:38.480
links, age of the domain, it's going to give you all the information on your competitors,

41:40.080 --> 41:46.560
all of their information. The only thing that it's not doing in the detail that I would like

41:46.560 --> 41:53.600
it to do right this second, but that Ryan has told me he's working on is giving an in-depth

41:53.600 --> 41:59.120
backlink profile, which that is what the developers, to my knowledge, are working on

41:59.120 --> 42:04.960
as we speak to have a backlink feature that shows you an in-depth look at the backlinks

42:04.960 --> 42:07.840
of the competitors. So right now, when you go into rank and rent engine, you type in your

42:07.840 --> 42:12.080
competitors, you type in your keywords, which is super easy. It literally calculates it in

42:13.200 --> 42:17.280
like a split second. It does tell you how many backlinks, but it doesn't give you the information

42:17.280 --> 42:22.720
in the detail that I would like it to make the decisions. Sometimes when you find these areas

42:22.720 --> 42:27.200
that they're a little bit more competitive, or you're wondering if they're too competitive

42:27.200 --> 42:31.120
and you want to look at the backlink profile, that's what I think is lacking. But that's the

42:31.120 --> 42:35.840
only thing that's lacking right now, and it's being worked on. But in terms of finding freaking

42:35.840 --> 42:41.040
areas, that right there is going to save you a ton of time, because I have done so many freaking

42:41.040 --> 42:46.240
due diligence by hand. And I've done them where I wrote them down on paper. I've done them where

42:46.240 --> 42:51.760
I had the Google Sheet and I would copy and make a new one. I've done it every kind of way you can

42:51.760 --> 42:56.720
think about. Use that tool. Okay. Other than that, I'm going to answer that question more

42:56.720 --> 43:00.880
depth. I want to get other people's ideas too inside of digital landlords. Okay. But great

43:00.880 --> 43:04.960
question. And a lot of it too is you just got to put in the reps. Like Francesca, you yourself,

43:04.960 --> 43:07.600
you've probably done a couple hundred yourself, right?

43:10.080 --> 43:14.080
Yes. And I was going to say, I know sometimes you feel like you get stuck sometimes with due

43:14.080 --> 43:19.040
diligence, especially when you do a bunch and none of them are really like a good result.

43:19.120 --> 43:25.440
But from my experience, then you'll hit like gold with one and he opens up a whole can of like

43:25.440 --> 43:30.240
locations, maybe nearby or something like that. So you may feel stuck, but I do feel like he also

43:30.240 --> 43:36.240
goes the other way around where you find a city or a state, something, some area, and then he

43:36.240 --> 43:44.160
really opens up for you multiple. Really good point. Really good point. Okay. I just barely,

43:44.320 --> 43:49.440
um, and Sean, I appreciate you being on the stream. I want to give Sean some swag. So I'm

43:49.440 --> 43:55.280
going to, he's a winner. You're a winner of let's give Sean the t-shirt, Sean, a t-shirt swag winner,

43:56.640 --> 43:59.440
your choice. We have a bunch of different, uh, t-shirts. In fact,

44:01.520 --> 44:04.800
let's see, let's see, let's give away a little bit more. Sorry. I like giving away stuff.

44:08.800 --> 44:13.920
Who thinks who wants some, let's ask this. Um, I want to ask, here's what I want to do. I want

44:13.920 --> 44:19.120
to ask a question, by the way, anyone that comes on live and asks me a question, just because I

44:19.120 --> 44:22.880
know people are like scared of it for some reason, I'm going to give you guys, uh, in addition to

44:22.880 --> 44:28.320
answering your question, I'm going to give you swag. Okay. So, um, Ravella, you are a swag winner

44:28.320 --> 44:31.360
because you were brave enough to come on and you didn't have to turn on your camera. Look at that.

44:31.360 --> 44:42.960
Okay. Swag winner, t-shirt, message Ashley. All right. Based on, let's look at who has good

44:42.960 --> 44:46.640
questions. If you have other questions, drop them in. But yeah, if you go just hop on and ask me

44:46.640 --> 44:53.200
live, I will happily give you some swag and answer your question. Again, before, as we kind of, you

44:53.200 --> 44:56.880
know, we got about 10, 15 minutes left here, but again, for those of you that maybe we're on

44:57.760 --> 45:02.080
a little bit late, um, our announcement that we had at the beginning, we are going to be doing a

45:02.080 --> 45:06.880
thousand days of renting shitty websites scholarship as we transition to a different

45:06.880 --> 45:11.600
version of this group, um, here in the next few weeks. And all you have to do is click the link,

45:11.600 --> 45:15.520
apply. It's probably going to take you two, three minutes, make it good answers. And if you are

45:15.520 --> 45:19.440
interested in winning the full scholarship, of course you are, that's why you're applying.

45:19.440 --> 45:25.440
But also if you don't win the full and you have a chance at a partial scholarship indicate so,

45:26.080 --> 45:31.760
so that we know who would qualify for that, uh, sub kind of side giveaway as well. Okay.

45:31.760 --> 45:38.080
We're going to be doing a handful of partial scholarships and one full complete community

45:38.800 --> 45:46.240
access, support, curriculum, coaching calls, a hundred percent, no catch, no nothing.

45:46.240 --> 45:51.360
You're completely in, um, as well as a free month of, uh, or a discount on ranking engine.

45:51.360 --> 45:55.680
Okay. So the link is in the comments and then we do have another question in there.

45:57.280 --> 46:03.920
Okay. Miguel Williams says, have you ever tried the legal niche? I personally have not,

46:04.400 --> 46:08.960
but you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to read something that I just got a message that I

46:08.960 --> 46:16.320
have just gotten literally, uh, 12, 14 today. Okay. I'm going to read it. This is one of, uh,

46:16.320 --> 46:19.280
my students inside digital landlords. I'm not going to use their name, but I'm going to,

46:19.280 --> 46:22.560
I'm going to send this to, I'm going to read this out loud. Okay. Yo, this is,

46:22.560 --> 46:28.560
I'm reading this entire thing. I'm about to close on a 30 K deal, 10 K upfront,

46:29.440 --> 46:35.120
and then installments of five K. Um, it's not rank and rent and it's paper model,

46:35.120 --> 46:39.600
paper lead model. The niche is personal injury lawyers. Just want to say your sales training

46:39.600 --> 46:42.800
has helped me in general, even if the deals I close are not traditional rank and rent

46:43.760 --> 46:47.760
or rent than rank. I'm going for deals that are 30 K per month as they seem to be the same amount

46:47.760 --> 46:52.880
of work as two K per month deals. Uh, don't want to share it as a win until the card is charged.

46:52.880 --> 46:57.120
And I don't want people to be asking how I did it, but I thought I would share here because I know

46:57.120 --> 47:02.240
how you like to hear about your students closing patties. Okay. So I just shared it. Sorry, bro.

47:02.240 --> 47:08.240
Um, I didn't, I'm not going to share the name. Um, but that's pretty dang cool. So I have not,

47:09.280 --> 47:14.640
I, I like the logic. What he's using is like, why, you know, if you can make 30,000 a month

47:15.680 --> 47:20.880
or $30,000 deal on a two K deal, it's not much difference in terms of work in terms of like

47:20.880 --> 47:27.920
building a website. Yeah, it's the same, but there are, I do disagree a bit because there are levels

47:27.920 --> 47:33.040
of work. And if you want to get into a blood bath, go into that niche. Okay. Go look at the cost per

47:33.040 --> 47:39.920
click on a, uh, personal injury attorney in Las Vegas, Nevada. It's like 250 bucks a click,

47:39.920 --> 47:45.840
something ridiculous. These are like a million dollar, multi-million dollar, uh, business deals.

47:45.840 --> 47:52.240
Right. I personally do not like those because look guys, I'm in this business to do the least

47:52.240 --> 47:56.960
amount of work possible for the most amount of money so I can go and live my life.

47:59.360 --> 48:02.400
And that's it. And I think most people are in that same, that same frame of thought.

48:02.400 --> 48:07.600
Like I shared this. Um, I think it was in here. Maybe it was inside digital landlords recently,

48:07.600 --> 48:11.760
but I used to think everyone was like, want to make a million dollars a month and want to get

48:11.760 --> 48:15.920
super rich and have mansions and jets and all this stuff. And I realized like, that's not what

48:15.920 --> 48:20.320
people want. People just want to live their life. People just want to be free. People just want to

48:20.320 --> 48:25.920
be able to do what they want to do. Like Francesca, if you didn't have to work tomorrow and money was

48:25.920 --> 48:30.320
just coming in, what would you do? Like what would you do tomorrow? What would you spend your time

48:30.320 --> 48:36.480
doing for the next week? Like an actual question. Yeah. I thought about that. I would go to culinary

48:36.480 --> 48:44.160
school. Amazing to learn how to cook more better. Yeah. Like for myself. Amazing. Like,

48:44.800 --> 48:50.160
and that would be freaking sick. Like how cool is it that Francesca, by the way, Francesca,

48:50.160 --> 48:53.760
you need to start closing some of your own deals. But we're going to talk about that before I let

48:53.760 --> 48:58.400
you do that. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Francesca is awesome. Francesca runs everything for me.

48:58.400 --> 49:02.160
She does all the work. She should get all the credit. Um, so I really don't want you doing that

49:02.160 --> 49:08.000
because I need you. Is that, is that fair? Yeah. Okay. But no, I mean, how cool is it that Francesca,

49:08.000 --> 49:12.560
if she wanted to, you know, could go and like, hey, I'm going to go to culinary school,

49:12.560 --> 49:15.040
not because I need to make money, but because I would like to learn how to cook.

49:15.680 --> 49:22.160
How cool would it be if you're just like, one day you're like, I want to move. Uh, I'm going

49:22.160 --> 49:26.480
to move to Saudi Arabia because I want to go learn Arabic. I'm going to go there for a year.

49:26.480 --> 49:31.040
I'd like not to make money just because I want to learn Arabic. And by the way, funny story, uh,

49:31.040 --> 49:35.760
Francesca, I don't know if I told you this, I was in Dubai the last time I was in Dubai. I was

49:35.760 --> 49:41.520
at this restaurant and this guy, I met this guy, he's this young kid and he offered, he's like,

49:41.520 --> 49:46.480
dude, let me buy you a drink, whatever. I'm like, dude, you're 20. Like you're like your baby. You're

49:46.480 --> 49:52.080
not going to buy me a drink. Like no, no, no, thanks. You know? Um, and so he's just having

49:52.080 --> 49:58.000
this great time. And then he had a friend with him and I said, you know, I talked to, I said to

49:58.000 --> 50:01.360
the friend, I said, Hey, nice to meet you. My name is Nick. And I said, this is your friend.

50:01.360 --> 50:05.920
He's like, no, I'm his bodyguard. And I thought they were joking, of course, right? You can still

50:05.920 --> 50:11.920
hear me, right Francesca? Yeah. Okay. It's a good story. And he's like, no, I'm his bodyguard. And

50:11.920 --> 50:16.240
he didn't smile or he smiled, but I could tell he was serious. And I was like, I kind of got scared

50:16.240 --> 50:21.200
a little bit. I'm like, what is this guy into drugs? Um, and anyway, I got the guy's Instagram

50:21.920 --> 50:28.160
and the next day he messaged me and said, whatever, nice to meet you. And I said,

50:28.160 --> 50:32.080
and I remember distinctly, he had shown me a picture of a Lamborghini,

50:33.440 --> 50:37.360
yellow Lamborghini. And I was like, that's sick, dude. But I didn't really register to me. I'm

50:37.360 --> 50:40.320
like, why then? Then I started thinking, I'm like, so how do you, I said, what do you do?

50:40.320 --> 50:44.160
He's like, dude, I'm in college. I'm like, well, how do you have a Lamborghini? He's like, oh,

50:44.800 --> 50:49.680
he's like, I thought I told you, he's like, I'm part of the royal family or whatever, the Saudi,

50:49.680 --> 50:55.600
whatever, whatever that family is that has all the money. The, uh, what's, I looked it up. It's,

50:55.600 --> 51:07.120
it's legit. Um, uh, well, there's a specific family name. It's the Saud, Saud, Saud, S-A-U-D.

51:08.320 --> 51:12.160
So anyway, that, that was, that was fun. But, uh, that just made me think of that. Cause he's from,

51:12.160 --> 51:15.920
he's from Saudi Arabia. He was in there for like a three day weekend and then he flew to Saudi

51:15.920 --> 51:22.000
Arabia. Um, interesting people, the people you meet, right? And my point being is that,

51:22.000 --> 51:24.880
and he was like, yeah, you should come visit Saudi Arabia. I'm like, I don't know if that's

51:24.880 --> 51:29.280
dangerous, but it sounds really fun. Um, I'd love to come. Can I meet your dad?

51:30.640 --> 51:35.200
I want to go hang out with his dad. Um, but anyway, uh, the point being guys is that you can,

51:35.200 --> 51:40.240
you can do whatever you want. You, you, you go, you make your money and then you do what you

51:40.240 --> 51:47.040
want to do. You go, you know, become a pastor. You go and, and do service trips. You go and,

51:47.600 --> 51:52.800
you know, become a coach, uh, and not because you're going to make 600 bucks working for

51:52.800 --> 51:56.720
four months. Like coaches don't get paid near enough, but like you could do whatever you want.

51:56.720 --> 52:03.120
It's so exciting that you can do that. Um, and so my whole point with that, I'm going to circle

52:03.120 --> 52:06.480
back around. I'm starting to get a little like Kanye and going off on the tangents, but to bring

52:06.480 --> 52:12.960
this tie this back in is I want to go into niches. I want to go into deals that I can go in,

52:12.960 --> 52:18.240
get a quick win, make a juicy profit, uh, and then go on to another one. And I have a low

52:18.240 --> 52:23.600
maintenance guys. If you're dealing with personal injury attorneys, you are going to not only have

52:23.600 --> 52:27.440
a lot of work, a lot of work. I don't think you even know, but you're also going to be dealing

52:27.440 --> 52:32.480
with a clientele. That's not going to give you much slack. They are going to be very much on

52:32.480 --> 52:35.600
your back to make sure that they are ranked and ranked highly, because you're going to be charging

52:35.600 --> 52:42.000
if you're charging $30,000, guess what? What happens if that person wants to do a charge back

52:42.000 --> 52:46.320
and they're an attorney, they're going to look at the contract and be like, yeah, we're going to

52:46.320 --> 52:50.560
charge back. We know our rights, blah, blah, blah. I just don't think it's worth it. That's just a

52:50.560 --> 52:54.480
whole long way of saying, I'm not, I'm not doing it, but I do know people that have had success.

52:56.480 --> 53:00.000
Chris says, if I didn't have to work, I'd want to learn how to be the Morgan, how to be Morgan

53:00.000 --> 53:08.000
Wallen. Morgan Wallen has taken the freaking age. Morgan Wallen has stolen every woman's heart and

53:08.000 --> 53:13.440
woman and man's heart from the age of 14 to 40, because I'm in that category too. Shout out to

53:13.440 --> 53:20.000
you, Morgan. Just quit getting drunk and throwing chairs. You like Morgan Wallen? Yeah. Good. You

53:20.000 --> 53:23.520
should. Francesca has some of the most interesting tastes of music ever. You get in her car,

53:23.520 --> 53:27.760
it's freaking a different language. Somebody rocking out, that's completely on acid. It's

53:27.760 --> 53:34.960
amazing. Let's do this. I want to know, I'm going to ask a question. I'm going to give some swag

53:34.960 --> 53:39.520
away based on the answers. I want to ask this question for the group is, and by the way,

53:39.520 --> 53:43.600
if you're listening to this after the fact, let's say you're watching this and it's Saturday or

53:43.600 --> 53:47.360
you're watching it Sunday or you're watching this next week, you can still answer in the comments.

53:47.360 --> 53:51.200
And if I like the answer, I'll still do this. I want to give some swag away based on these answers.

53:51.200 --> 53:56.880
If you did not have to worry about money, let's say you had $20,000 a month coming in

53:57.760 --> 54:02.320
which covers your bills and gives you some money to be able to travel if you wanted to.

54:02.320 --> 54:06.400
Money was not an issue. You didn't have to worry about money tomorrow. You like whatever. It was

54:06.400 --> 54:12.160
taken care of $20,000 in passive income from renting simple websites. What would you spend

54:12.160 --> 54:16.400
your time doing? I want to know in the comments and I'm going to be based on my favorite answers.

54:16.400 --> 54:19.280
I'm going to be giving away some swag. Francesca, I love your answer. That's why I'm giving you

54:19.280 --> 54:23.680
the hoodie. You earned your hoodie. Perfect. But you have to post in it. You have to post a picture

54:23.680 --> 54:29.200
in it just so everyone sees it. Is that fair? Okay. Easy. Deal. Okay. What would you guys?

54:30.240 --> 54:36.480
Sorry. Go ahead. No, you go ahead. We have Chris asking favorite ways to close a baddie.

54:38.240 --> 54:45.200
A baddie or a fatty. I see a B unless I'm going wild. When you say a baddie, I need you to...

54:45.840 --> 54:51.040
I think he means a deal. If we're talking about baddie, like we're talking about like some like

54:51.680 --> 54:55.440
some like nasty chick baddie. Like that's what I think when I think of baddie. But hopefully

54:55.440 --> 55:00.960
he's talking about like just a big deal. I mean, my only tip with that... And by the way, guys,

55:00.960 --> 55:04.400
I want to hear your comments. If you start to see... I don't know if I'm not seeing comments

55:04.400 --> 55:08.160
or no one's responded yet, but if you start to see the comments, let me know. I want to hear

55:08.160 --> 55:12.400
what would you do tomorrow? What would you spend your time doing if money... You had $20,000 a month

55:12.400 --> 55:17.520
coming in from renting simple little websites and the world was your canvas. What would you do?

55:17.520 --> 55:21.520
Francesca would go to culinary school. Okay. What would you do? You know what I would do,

55:21.520 --> 55:30.000
Francesca? What? Travel. And that's exactly what I'm doing. That's why you see me in Dubai every

55:30.000 --> 55:36.160
five minutes because I'm just getting it out of my system. I didn't grow up traveling. The idea that

55:36.160 --> 55:44.240
I could make money while I was traveling was so enticing. And that's why you see that I was home.

55:44.240 --> 55:50.240
I got back from Dubai 10 days ago and I'm already in Vegas and I'm literally just getting... I just

55:50.240 --> 55:57.200
like to be moving. I get inspired. I look out. I can see the city. It's like... I don't know.

55:57.920 --> 56:01.840
That's what I would do and that's what I'm doing is I'm traveling. I'm seeing the world. There's so

56:01.840 --> 56:06.000
many places I want to see. I want to go to Kenya. I want to go to India. I want to go to the places

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
that you don't want to go to. I promise you. I want to go to the freaking ratchet dirty places.

56:10.000 --> 56:15.520
That's more attractive to me. So that's what I would want to do. Fino says... Okay, hold on.

56:15.520 --> 56:20.000
Laura says... Okay, let's go through some of these. But I think... Hold on.

56:21.120 --> 56:24.800
Do you want to answer the baddie? Yeah, I want to answer the baddie first and then I'm going to go

56:24.800 --> 56:31.280
through these. So if we're talking about baddie in terms of a fatty, in terms of a deal, okay?

56:31.280 --> 56:37.280
My only advice is you got to go in there with complete confidence like you've done it 100 times.

56:37.280 --> 56:40.480
Francesca, you know what we're going to do? I'm going to actually let you answer that because

56:40.480 --> 56:43.280
you disclosed a fatty. And by the way, somebody was in the waiting room. I just missed it.

56:43.280 --> 56:47.040
Whoever you were, come back in. I would love for you to answer your question. But really quick,

56:47.040 --> 56:52.720
Francesca, this is your question because you just closed a freaking $7,500 a month deal.

56:52.720 --> 56:55.760
Tell us. Give us a tip. Favorite ways.

56:56.560 --> 57:00.640
Well, favorite ways is... I don't think it's favorite ways. I think the better answer,

57:00.640 --> 57:02.880
the better question is... The best way to...

57:02.880 --> 57:06.160
Tips. Because the best way to is you just freaking go in, you're confident,

57:06.160 --> 57:11.920
you close the deal. It's the same process. But give us a tip. You smashed that deal.

57:11.920 --> 57:16.960
I've never closed the deal that big. I closed the deal that grew into a deal that was big,

57:16.960 --> 57:19.360
but I've never closed a $7,500 a month deal.

57:20.560 --> 57:25.920
Well, I would say for me, two things. One is prepare early. I got to mentally...

57:26.560 --> 57:28.160
And it doesn't... I know it's...

57:28.160 --> 57:32.720
Yeah, you like to prepare. I know you. If you tell Francesca you got a sales call in an hour,

57:32.720 --> 57:35.520
she's tripping. She needs 24 hours mental prep, which is fine.

57:36.320 --> 57:43.120
It's 12, 12, 12. I just got to prepare, have my charger set up, my headphones set up.

57:43.120 --> 57:48.480
Everything needs to be neat and clean, ready to go. I need to be calm. And then the second is

57:48.480 --> 57:53.440
I follow every single... I still hold the script, not the PDF. I have it printed,

57:53.440 --> 57:59.440
I have it highlighted, following every single thing. Anytime I do that combo, it always works.

58:00.160 --> 58:00.720
Amazing.

58:00.720 --> 58:01.840
Not always, like 90%.

58:02.640 --> 58:07.280
I love that. And you closed that thing like no problem. We do have somebody in the waiting room.

58:07.280 --> 58:09.760
I'm going to let them in. I want to circle back on this. And then guys, we're going to go a little

58:09.760 --> 58:15.520
bit longer today because we can and I want to, and I'm excited to answer questions. And we have some

58:15.520 --> 58:18.720
really good answers. So hang with me just a second. I want to let this person in real quick.

58:20.240 --> 58:27.280
All right. It says PJ. Let's see if he can hear me. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see.

58:29.120 --> 58:30.240
There we go. Can you hear me?

58:30.240 --> 58:33.680
All right. It says PJ. Let's see.

58:33.680 --> 58:39.120
Oh, I think you got to turn off your screens so I don't double hear myself. PJ, can you hear me?

58:39.120 --> 58:40.000
There we go. Can you hear me?

58:40.000 --> 58:40.480
All right.

58:40.480 --> 58:41.200
Yo, what's up, dude?

58:42.000 --> 58:43.680
What's going on? I think I can double hear.

58:45.600 --> 58:46.080
Turn off your...

58:46.080 --> 58:48.160
Turn off your screens so I don't double hear on your side.

58:48.160 --> 58:48.960
Can you hear me?

58:48.960 --> 58:49.840
There we go. Can you hear me?

58:50.480 --> 58:51.040
What's up, dude?

58:51.920 --> 58:53.600
What's going on? I think I can double hear.

58:56.640 --> 58:57.840
There we go. Can you hear me now?

58:58.320 --> 59:05.360
Okay. PJ, do this. Just mute your volume on your Facebook live so I can't hear that,

59:05.360 --> 59:09.360
but then you can turn your mic back on because I'm just hearing myself. It's a nightmare.

59:09.360 --> 59:12.240
Francesca's like, oh my gosh, there's more than one. There's like three of Nick.

59:12.240 --> 59:13.760
That's the biggest nightmare ever.

59:13.760 --> 59:14.320
Terrifying.

59:14.320 --> 59:15.360
It was terrifying me.

59:15.360 --> 59:19.200
You can pause it or you can pause it instead of muting it. If you just pause it.

59:19.200 --> 59:21.680
Yeah, pause it because Francesca's done that twice already on the stream today.

59:21.680 --> 59:22.720
It's off now.

59:22.720 --> 59:23.760
There we go. What's up, dude?

59:24.720 --> 59:26.400
Not much, man. It's been a while. How are you doing?

59:26.560 --> 59:27.840
It's been a while. How are you doing?

59:27.840 --> 59:30.560
Good, man. Where are you tuning in from?

59:31.360 --> 59:32.640
Phoenix, Arizona.

59:32.640 --> 59:36.400
What's up, man? How's things going? How's the weather? Looks like about like Vegas.

59:37.200 --> 59:39.840
Yeah, right. It's cooler right now. It's nice, actually.

59:39.840 --> 59:44.160
Beautiful. So what's up, man? You got anything specific you want to say? What's up?

59:44.160 --> 59:48.320
I just honestly wanted to say thank you to you. I think I've told you and Ryan Dalton,

59:48.320 --> 59:52.720
a lot of the OGs, you guys are awesome. Still kind of like on the frame or the free plan,

59:52.720 --> 59:57.600
trying to like kind of, you know, duct tape everything together to try to get into your

59:57.600 --> 01:00:01.760
course. I've been somewhat successful, but I have kind of struggled as we kind of talked before.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:06.160
I went to like Phoenix and I went to Houston. Now I'm kind of doing Glendale, Arizona,

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:10.640
doing some concrete and I feel like I got the ad down and the website, you know, with all the

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:16.480
words, the 2000 plus on the homepage and then the services page, a thousand, but I'm still

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:20.080
struggling a little bit just and I'm using rank and rent, but I'm on the free one with the one

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.920
number because like I said, I'm still trying to bootstrap it together, but I'm just trying to

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.680
make it work, man. I just honestly wanted to jump on here. I didn't really have that many questions.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:31.520
I know you kind of answered quite a few already, so I've honestly just been kind of tuning in,

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.400
listening, kind of going over my ad stuff while you've kind of been doing the call,

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.000
but I just want to jump on and say, what's up, man? I also kind of try to, not to cut you off,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.280
I tried to join a couple of times, but it like, I don't know, I wasn't getting added,

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.600
so I was like, whatever, I'll just stay on the Facebook and it's all good.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:48.880
No, you're good. I think I just didn't see it, so I appreciate you hopping on. So number one is,

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.120
dude, you should apply for the scholarship, by the way. I don't know if you haven't already,

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.280
but apply for the scholarship and then we'll easily remember you because you came on.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:02.480
So also message Ashley and get yourself a t-shirt, whatever one you want. So I appreciate

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:10.240
you hopping on. And yeah, dude, I mean, just keep going, bro. I mean, though it's crazy,

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:15.760
I'd say this and message me privately. Maybe we can figure something out, but dude, it's crazy

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.640
because how long have you been trying to like, put this together? Like how long have you kind of

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:25.920
been doing this? So I told you before on Instagram, but we haven't talked in a while. I found you like

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:30.800
two years ago and I was doing other things online, kind of developing my skillset, doing Amazon,

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.480
some different things. And I've had some success online with different things, but I mostly just

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.400
want to focus on websites and stuff. And kind of like you, your story, I wasn't even able to sell

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:43.280
my best websites for really anything. People just didn't value it. Doing the SEO, different things,

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.560
add some other skill sets that I had. I'm like, how can I take all the skills that I have and

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:54.000
sell them to someone at a fair price? Then I came across you two years later, back in August here.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.440
And that's when I started my first one. I was like, I'm not still that successful in some of

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.960
the things I like. Let's give this one more go before I just say, screw it. I'm done with it.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:08.000
And so I kind of started to do it without even having a website. I sold the first guy on the

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:14.080
pitch in Houston pretty easily. It was like a thousand bucks. I'll do a thousand bucks easy.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.160
I was like, damn, I better get to work. I don't have anything yet, but I proved to myself after

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:24.560
calling five people that it's a good hook. People are like, free leads. I'll try it out. A thousand

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.520
bucks. I'm like, I need to make this $2,000 real quick. So that didn't work out just because it

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:34.000
was really competitive in Houston, but it kind of showed me. And I was basically two weeks into

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.240
kind of like, you know, re-seeing you again and jumping into it without you. So like,

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.000
I'm just going to get started and learn all the free stuff as I go. And I was like, man,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.320
I'm actually seeing some success. I'm kind of like sold on this. Like this is pretty easy. As long as

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.040
I'm pretty techie, I'm okay salesman. I'm like, as long as I brush up the things or I find some

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.760
things about myself as an entrepreneur, I'm like, I could easily sell it as a deal. A lot easier than

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.760
anything else I've ever tried to sell. So it just, it kind of clicked for me, you know?

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:08.800
Yeah, no. Dude, don't give up on the model, man. What happens, one of my buddies was texting me

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:14.240
like two nights ago and this guy, they make him and his wife make a lot of money doing a couple

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:19.200
different things. Like he sells solar and she has like a business. They make a lot of money,

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.240
but he's like tired of like knocking doors, right? He's like, I just want to get something

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:27.840
that's residual. So he's asking me about like joining. And his brother-in-law

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.520
was like trying to do this. And he's like, how's he doing? And I was like, well, I don't know. He's

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:37.440
like, I think he kind of like got distracted or whatever. And I said this to him. I was like,

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:42.800
this is what happens with almost everybody is they get excited. It makes sense. They stumble a bit

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:48.960
or they just get distracted from something like whatever. It's easier to just do something new

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:54.720
than to figure out the solution to what you're currently working on. And they go and they try

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.640
other things or they go back into a job and they, but they always make it back.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.880
And so it was the same with me, dude. I got a couple of deals. I got to, I call it too smart

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.080
for the model. I was like, ah, this is too like, this is, I don't want to do this. I don't want to

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:12.480
tell people I do. I'm a market. I have, I own a marketing company. Like that's lame. And I'm like,

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:17.680
then I really learned what lame is. It's not making money. And I'm like, okay, that's lame.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:26.720
And so, you know, nine, 10 months later, 50, $60,000 down the drain debt limping confidence shot.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:31.200
I came back humbly and I was like, all right, let's give this a real shot. And then dude,

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.960
I made money, but I didn't do it correctly. I wasn't doing the flat V model. I wasn't

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:38.640
doing a, of course I wasn't doing pre-selling cause I didn't know it.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.800
And I almost gave up again in 2019. I was about to just go be a salesperson. And I was like,

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.080
let me just, just like you, I'm going to give it one more chance. And I'm going to figure out this

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.720
pre-selling thing. And dude, it's like that story at the beginning of think and grow rich.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:55.680
Like I was literally three feet from gold. I was eight months away from making a hundred

01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:01.200
thousand dollars a month. And I have not made less than that since July of 2020. I haven't

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.840
had a month that's less than that. And I was almost to give up on it, dude. I almost settled

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:12.640
for being a salesperson with probably a top potential max earning of like 20 grand a month

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:16.720
if I was killing it. So yeah, dude, don't give up, bro. This is the model I've,

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:23.680
if something else comes along that beats this dude, I'll, I'll jump. Trust me. I'm an opportunist.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:30.480
I'm not married to this model, but right now this is the best model to become, you know,

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:34.000
it's as passive as it can become. And then you can go do what you want to do. So I want to ask

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.840
you this and I'll let you get off, bro. What would you do if you didn't have to worry about money?

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.720
20,000. I'm sorry to cut you off. I heard you there, but not to cut you off. I was actually

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.840
getting on here so I could actually comment in. Cause I'm like, I don't know if they want us to

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.680
comment in on Facebook or on here, but I was like, whether I get on the camera or not, like I'm not

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:53.920
scared of the camera. I'll let you down. I was saying I was going to type in music and travel.

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:58.400
We have similar goals, but probably music and travel. That's cool, man. What music like you'd

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:03.840
want to produce? You'd want to, are you like, you'd be the voice? Like what, what part of music?

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:10.480
DJ. Yeah. Like DJ music producing. That's dope, dude. That's dope. At least at least test it out,

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.440
but everything takes money. And I'm like, I want to have that cashflow, uh, you know,

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:19.360
wheel going and working well. So that way, if I try something and it doesn't work, I don't care.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:23.680
And I still just love it. And I would do it anyway. Yeah, bro. It's, dude, it's such the game,

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:28.720
like no matter what you want to do, I have, uh, one of my friends is a, he like literally creates

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:31.840
music. He's trying to do that, but he's trying to make his money through that.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:40.320
And dude, he's, he's, I mean, he's been putting out music for two years and I think he's Spotify

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:44.960
checks. He, he just texted me today. His Spotify checks are still less than a thousand bucks a

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:50.640
month. And in my mind, I'm like, dude, just go make 20 grand with renting simple websites.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:56.880
Right. And then dude, your music can be art because you don't have to make money. You don't

01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:01.920
have to jump on a trend that's going to hit. Like you can just, it can be like from your soul

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:05.120
and you can really enjoy it. Cause I think he's in that part where it's just like a grind and a

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:10.880
hustle now and it's a job. But if you really love it, like, dude, then the money's just a bonus. So

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:16.160
I love that, bro. And I hope that, uh, dude, you can, if you want to go make 20 grand and go,

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:20.480
go chase it, bro. Dude, I have to, I can't quit now. And just like you said, everything has it

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:24.000
like, you know, Alex or Mosley to that Valley to spare everything you do. So I always think about

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.760
that all the time. And I have a lot of great people and sayings from you and other people on

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.560
my wall. And I'm just like, if I quit now, it's all for nothing. And I put in about five years

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:36.480
ish into web development. So I'm like, I'm to the point where it is actually going to finally pay

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:41.680
off. And I spent a lot of those years broke in this particular online skills. Um, but I was like,

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.960
it's about to pay off big. So, I mean, if I quit now, I'd just be like you, that little, that one

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:49.120
more dig and then, you know, you, you quit or you keep going. So it's like, I think about that all

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.720
the time, but I really just, it's not that about making money. It's like, how can I help people

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:57.520
and take my skills? And so I get value, they get value. And it's just like a slam dunk for me,

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.960
them and the customer. And that's the only way I tell them, like your customer wins, you win

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:06.480
and I win. Like we get a triple slam dunk and like, who's mad at that? Nobody. It's true, man.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.560
Well, I love it, bro. Please keep, keep in touch. Send me a DM, um, on Instagram or on Facebook and

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.240
let's talk and see if we can work something out and apply for the scholarship. Sure. A hundred

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:20.160
percent. All right. Thank you so much. Appreciate you bro. Talk soon. Later. Okay. Let's go through

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:25.120
really quick. Appreciate you guys staying on to the end. Let's go through some of these answers,

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.600
give away some swag. We'll hop off. Okay. Yeah, we got a lot of answers. Yeah. I'm going to read

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:38.080
them and I'm going to let you choose like your top favorite three. Okay. Oh, okay. Let's see Anthony.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:41.280
No, notary says he'd build schools in poverty stricken countries.

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.920
Guys, I would love to see every one of these answers. I would love to sit down,

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.160
like, I'd love to sit down with you, Anthony, and just, and ask you that, like, I love that

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:54.320
answer, but I would love to know why. Like what, what is it about your past? What is about your

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:58.960
situation? What is it about your life and your experiences that that's the thing that you would

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.680
spend your time doing? Because I think it's a very noble, noteworthy thing to do, but I'm always

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:08.400
curious of the why behind the answer. So anyway, that's, I can't because of that kind of time,

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:13.920
but that's a great answer. Laura says being a snowbird going south for the winter, packing up

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:19.360
my husband and little guy and avoiding the winter. Yeah, I can relate to that. That is,

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:25.120
that is kind of what I'm doing. As soon as it gets cold, I immediately become not depressed,

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.800
but my mood gets a bit crappy. And so yeah, I'm actually right now planning on,

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:37.280
so I'm here for Christmas. I want to be with the kids. And then the day after or two days

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:41.920
after I'm either going to be in Africa or Dubai, I just have to get out of the cold. I hate it.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.480
And I don't have to be in it. So I'm not going to be in it. Okay. Fino, if I had 20K,

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:52.480
I'd show my family the world. I like that answer. Kevin says I would spend time in a wood workshop

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:58.880
where I would build and create all day. I also really like that answer. Eric says travel the

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.320
world and not have to worry about money at all. Live in a van, do surfing, drive Vespa, have my

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:07.840
own bar at the beach and watch it. That sounds amazing by the way. That sounds like freaking the

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.080
Africa, bro. You could do all of that or move to Thailand. But I like that answer a lot.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:22.080
Fino said 7,500 a month. Yes, that was a real deal that she got. Can you confirm I had nothing to

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:25.920
do with that deal? Like I did not get on that call. I didn't do anything with that deal.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:31.280
No, you didn't get on the call. I'd love to take credit. You never get on the call.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.480
I never get on Zoom calls. No, I refuse. Francesca's like, hey, can you hop on Zoom? Like, no.

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:41.120
Yeah, that's the answer. I always text her, I'm like, you got this. And you do.

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.200
It's like we're taking the training wheels off and you're my daughter and we're teaching

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:53.600
you how to ride a bike. That's all. Jen said way to rock it, Francesca. I'd travel all over Europe

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:58.720
and the world with my wife and kids. Spend three weeks in each location engaging with cultures,

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:03.200
people and their history. It all fascinates me. I love that answer. That's exactly my mindset as

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:11.760
well. Only place I'd probably skip is Italy. Whatever. I'm just kidding. You would love it.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:18.480
No, I'm going to go. I'm going to go. Okay. Miguel says I would spend my time helping other people.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:26.560
Jason said, which again, a noteworthy thing to say and to do, Jason Aldridge says travel for sure,

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:31.120
but also volunteer for homeless slash elderly and love to have time to learn to play the piano I

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:37.280
bought six years ago. Rev, amazing by the way. If I don't say amazing, I hope you guys know I like

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:42.560
all these answers. As I'm reading them, I'm like picturing them and it's like taking me places.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:52.160
Rev says I would discover shamanism because I'm half Athabascan, Native American and half Nigerian,

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:57.920
but grew up adopted. Wow. That's crazy. I have never heard that combination.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:05.440
Half Athabascan, Native American and half Nigerian. That is amazing actually,

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.400
but grew up adopted and would love to learn and discover the roots of my culture. I think that

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:18.640
that's very cool when people want to go and figure out where they came from. Some of us have culture.

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:27.520
People ask me where I'm from and I'm like, I'm just, I'm white. And they're like, no,

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:36.320
people like, no, you're like, I get, what's it called? Arab. I get the Arab comment a lot now

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:42.240
with the beard, which I don't know how to think about that. Steven says I'd go live on a nice

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:48.000
cruise ship for a while, visit places and meet lots of people. Chris, too much Nick for us there,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.880
almost exploded from the strength of multiple Nicks. That was scaring me too.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.680
Kristin, if I didn't have to work because of that incoming money, I'd move on back to the rural,

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:59.200
travel the states with my kids. We don't travel much now, so it would blow their minds. You know

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.680
how kids get just when entering a hotel room and go berserk over a new room and jump on the bed of

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:10.320
travel. That's so true, dude. Kids are so pure. My kids, Francesca, you ever stayed at the Trump Tower?

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.560
No, actually. You would like it because there's no casino. It's really clean.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:23.360
They have the bathrobes that you can borrow, and my kids are like, they love that Trump casino

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:27.280
because you can wear the bathroom. Of course, that's three times too long for them, and they

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:32.400
put on huge slippers. They're like, the Trump is so sick. It's such a cool hotel. It's like, bro,

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:40.400
it's a bathrobe. They're like $20 robes, but it's so true. Kevin says I would help my son

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.320
manage and promote his music career so he can just focus on creative work and performances. I'd spend

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:50.480
the rest of my spare time traveling with my wife and enjoying retirement. Amazing. Love Nick's story.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:55.040
So inspiring. Thank you, sir. So much you can do with music now. The sky's the limit. It's so true.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:14:05.200
Music's so inspiring. I actually really appreciate people that do that. Porter is the most

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:10.240
unserious person. Porter said he would get Taggy alive. Let me just tell you this last story.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:16.560
Let's get hold on. I don't know if we have time for that story. The fact that Porter makes $9,400

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.720
per month can inspire everyone on this call with that answer, and that is another story for another

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:26.960
time. It's an inside joke, and it's hilarious. Let me just say this. Taggy is this guy that was our

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:33.040
house cleaner in Africa, and the big joke, because Porter's wife actually got pregnant when we were

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:39.200
in Africa, which is weird. Thanks, bro. It's so disgusting. Thanks for doing that. The big joke

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:49.120
is Porter the dad or is the house cleaner the dad? His name's Tegba, but he's very smelly. He's

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:56.080
deodorant, so that's why he's saying deodorant. It's terrible. I hope Teg was not in this group.

01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.440
Taggy, I'm sorry. Eric says Italy's beautiful, Nick. Okay, I'll go. Don't worry. Learning the

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:08.880
language Italian. Jason Allred's a good one. Any other answers? I'd homeschool my four boys

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.480
and sponsor health and fitness programs for the sick and overweight. That's a cool answer.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:18.400
Okay, let's give away some swag. Let's give away some swag. All right, Jessica.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:26.560
That's hard. I really like the idea of the kids traveling, jumping on the bed. That just made me

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:33.600
smile. Yeah, I do too. That's Chris. I'm going to give him. Let's give Chris a free swag

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:40.160
T-shirt, message, Ashley. Yeah, I like that answer. What's your second one?

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:48.800
I like the one that Kevin, he would help his son with his like music career and then also travel

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.200
with his wife. I like all the traveling ones. It's hard because they kind of all answered

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:59.360
as similar, so it's hard to pick, you know, one. One more. Let's do one more that stood out to you.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.200
I like that one too. So Kevin's a winner. Chris is a winner.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:10.640
He has one more. Okay, I like the one that says Miguel, I would spend my time helping

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:16.960
other people. It sounds vague, but I get what he's saying. Like you can volunteer,

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.600
you can do a lot of stuff. I feel like a lot of people would do,

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.680
but you just don't have the time when you have to work.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:27.200
You know what I was thinking as I was reading these answers is how amazing, like

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.720
how beautiful the world would be if people didn't have to worry about money. Like

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:36.400
how the inventions that would come, the music that would come, the art that would come,

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:41.520
I think things would just be better. Like it would just be unbelievable. It'd be really,

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.560
really cool. And I think everyone would be more, I think when you travel, you become more open-minded

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:51.360
and I think you're more of a, not everybody, but I think I'm more understanding when people

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:57.120
aren't exactly like me. And yeah, I think that nothing, there's no downside to traveling.

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.200
I think you're only become a better person in my opinion. I agree a hundred percent.

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:11.520
Amazing. I think that will do it guys. If you haven't already apply for the scholarship,

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:17.120
if you want to, it's called the thousand days of a thousand day celebrate celebration of renting

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:22.800
shitty websites. Apply, it takes you a few minutes. The links in the description, it's

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.600
pinned at the top. Appreciate you guys. Love this group. It's been an amazing three years

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:32.160
and we haven't been on live much because again, people just don't value what they don't pay for.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:37.760
But I know at some point that each and every one of you, if you guys stay on the path,

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:44.880
we'll end up working together at some capacity. And again, to what like PJ, when he came on,

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:48.800
don't give up because you are a lot closer than you guys think.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:54.800
You could be eight months away from a thousand dollars, a hundred thousand dollars per month.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:59.280
So Francesca, thanks for hopping on. Yep. Thank you. Okay. See you guys.
