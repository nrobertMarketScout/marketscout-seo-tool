00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Carol, what's the best way to deal with business owners that are ghosting or complaining about

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,560
the job size not even closing because they can't sell? This is one of the problems with giving away

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,280
free leads, right? Is they don't value it because I can guarantee if it was a lead that they got

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,040
from their own website or their own marketing or from even home advisors that they paid for,

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,440
they probably wouldn't be complaining. The only thing that I can say is that try to find out

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,120
upfront what it is that they're looking for and just let them know. Just like I talked about with

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,280
Luke just now, just let them know, say, hey, not all of these are going to be fat, juicy deals.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,240
What are you looking for? What's your best? What's your second best? What's your third best?

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,640
What do you not want? And I'll try to get you as many good ones as I can and try to filter out

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,040
these other ones. But here's what I always let people know is like, yeah, I get it. That happens.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,040
It's just part of the game. And I'll always mention that's the beauty of how we structure

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,040
these deals. I won't tell them flat fee. I'll say the beauty of the way that we're going to

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,720
structure this deal once we talk, and I know we're not going to talk right now, but when we do,

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,280
these type of jobs, when they come in, you don't have to run these jobs. You can do whatever. You

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,800
could throw them away. You give them away. You cannot answer the phone. It's going to be up to

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,440
you. We have a really nice deal structure that's going to allow you to do that. And in the back of

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,960
my mind, I'm thinking, oh, I'm going to do flat fee. And they don't have to run them because

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,320
they're not feeling like they're getting charged for every single lead because it's all included

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,880
in the same price. So I use that as just a way to make the flat fee even sweeter. But I don't bring

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,080
it up. I don't say, yeah, that's why we do flat fee. And I just say, hey, this is the beauty of

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,040
the way we structure this deal, which by the way, I'm going to talk about when we zoom here,

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,480
but yeah, if you don't like that, just don't run it. We'll get you another one, right? It's,

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,840
but again, I'm just giving you free leads, but they cost you nothing. So you may as well run it.

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,440
You may as well run it. It costs you nothing, right? That's what I would do.
