Kyle says he's simpler to use and Kyle if you, I was asking to what your thoughts are on what Tim's question was if you want to weigh in on that but again, I'm always playing it safe.

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not into black cat strategies I'm not into whatever some of my, some of my techniques take a little bit longer. But guys, we're building assets we're building something yes you know that content is going to take you a couple hours to write.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But that content is going to produce you lead after lead after lead after lead and once you rank those leads are free dude they don't cost you additional money everything doesn't cost you money they're free leads once they come in organically.

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So, the way I look at it is the content might take me two hours of my time and my time is valuable, right or two hours and I had to pay somebody 50 bucks an hour or 20 bucks an hour.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And once I get, you know, 20 leads in five in five months or whatever seven months that spend a $50 or $100 was paid for 100 times over right because I was able to bring the ads down.
