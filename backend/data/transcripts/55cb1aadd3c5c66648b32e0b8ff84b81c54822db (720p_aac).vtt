00:00.000 --> 00:08.160
Okay. So guys, welcome to the call. It is October 22nd, 2024. We're almost a month into

00:08.160 --> 00:15.000
Q4, which is going to put us at like, you know, we have like two to less than two and

00:15.000 --> 00:20.080
a half months, like 10 weeks left in the year, probably less than 10 weeks left in the year.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.640
And it's just crazy how these years are flying by these months are flying by. But anyway,

00:23.640 --> 00:29.640
I just saw the date really quick. Couple things real, real quick. Number one, I hope you guys

00:29.640 --> 00:38.400
are having as much fun and as excited about this new RankinRent engine tool as I am. I'm

00:38.400 --> 00:42.040
not in there every single day. I don't want to lie to you, but I am doing this multiple

00:42.040 --> 00:46.960
times a week. I'm, you know, blocking out time where I can go in. I can run due diligence.

00:46.960 --> 00:51.720
I can, you know, we've added all of our projects in there. We're testing the search volume

00:51.720 --> 00:58.200
tool. We're looking at our, what's it called? Our project management side. And we're doing

00:58.200 --> 01:01.880
everything inside of RankinRent engine. So if you guys have no idea what I'm talking

01:01.880 --> 01:07.120
about, you probably were not on the live that we ran a couple of weeks ago with Ryan Dalton.

01:07.120 --> 01:15.400
And basically in short, we now have an official tool that we can say definitively, this is

01:15.400 --> 01:18.880
the tool that we're going to use. This is the standard. This is the metrics we're going

01:18.880 --> 01:22.520
to go off of. This is going to be when we say, here's how much it needs to be in search

01:22.520 --> 01:27.660
volume. It's going to go off of this tool. And that is exciting because up until now,

01:27.660 --> 01:32.720
it's kind of been like, hey, use whatever you want. And you have to kind of figure out

01:32.720 --> 01:38.580
the numbers on your own, which is good and bad. But I'm excited because I've never been

01:38.580 --> 01:43.660
able to like endorse any tool or say this is the one because I didn't have control over

01:43.660 --> 01:49.520
it. Right. And so, you know, we've used SEMrush. We've used Mangools. We've used, we've talked

01:49.520 --> 01:54.260
about keyword planner. We've talked about, what else? There's a bunch of different ones

01:54.260 --> 01:59.460
that we've talked about with Ahrefs, like all kinds of different stuff. But now we have

01:59.460 --> 02:05.620
one RankinRentEngine.com and we are in the middle of a four to five week beta test. It

02:05.620 --> 02:10.780
is a paid beta test and we've gotten some really, really good feedback. We know it's

02:10.780 --> 02:17.140
not perfect. We weren't expecting it to be perfect. And that's why we asked you guys

02:17.140 --> 02:22.980
to help us. And so I know for me and my team, we're in there between all of us. We're in

02:22.980 --> 02:27.380
there every single day and we've already done a bunch of, we've given a bunch of feedback

02:27.380 --> 02:33.460
to Ryan who he's taking to the developers and we're making those adjustments. And yeah.

02:33.460 --> 02:36.980
So anyway, if you guys don't know what I'm talking about, you missed that, go to RankinRentEngine.com

02:36.980 --> 02:42.240
what I would actually encourage you to do. And I'm saying this because I had somebody

02:42.240 --> 02:46.340
message me, it was this morning or yesterday that said, hey, so do you recommend that I

02:46.340 --> 02:52.440
use SEMrush? And I said, no, that's not the case at all. I recommend that you use RankinRentEngine.

02:52.440 --> 02:59.200
And so I want to drop this live that we did. Let me see if I can find it really quick.

02:59.200 --> 03:07.200
Hold on. Tool Ryan Dalton. Check out this live that I did with Ryan Dalton. And from

03:07.200 --> 03:18.560
this, hold on. Okay. Pause that. From this guys, you can go, what's up Nicholas John,

03:19.040 --> 03:23.440
man. Okay. You guys want to check that out. And if you are somebody that wants to be part

03:23.440 --> 03:31.080
of the paid beta, you can use the following code. I'll drop that in as well. Here we go.

03:31.080 --> 03:38.080
I think it's Ignition24 and it's like a 20% off discount for the first couple of months.

03:38.080 --> 03:44.760
But I am stoked about the tool. Just because it does all the stuff that I was, I had like

03:44.760 --> 03:52.240
all kinds of tools. I had Google Sheets. We had Pipe Drive. We had a custom tool that

03:52.240 --> 04:01.640
our software guy built for us. We were using, at one point using Asana. We were also using,

04:01.640 --> 04:04.160
there's another one. I can't even remember what it's called. I mean, we had like five,

04:04.160 --> 04:07.720
six, seven different tools that we were checking out, trying with Google Drive, this, that,

04:07.720 --> 04:11.720
the rest. Now we have one place. We have our team members. We can assign tasks. We can

04:11.760 --> 04:16.280
keep track. We can see what we need to do. And it's pretty dang cool. You can see your projects.

04:16.280 --> 04:21.000
It saves all your due diligence. If nothing else, the thing that I love the most, guys,

04:21.000 --> 04:24.240
is that it's saving me a ton of time on the due diligence. So anyway, guys,

04:24.240 --> 04:28.280
if you don't know what I'm talking about, then check out that live. Use that code if you're

04:28.280 --> 04:32.480
interested. If not, we're going to be doing an official launch the first or second week

04:32.480 --> 04:37.760
of November, but it is going to be full price. So if you're interested, I would check that out

04:37.840 --> 04:43.040
as soon as possible. Okay. Last two things, guys, really, really quick. I made this post

04:43.040 --> 04:47.920
inside of the art of digital real estate, our free group. And I did that because I didn't want

04:47.920 --> 04:53.040
to confuse anyone. I wanted to wait and explain this to you guys. But guys, if you do not already,

04:53.040 --> 04:57.360
hold on one second. Let me get rid of these stupid notifications. If you do not already,

04:59.280 --> 05:02.640
hold on, hold on. Give me one second.

05:02.640 --> 05:14.880
Okay. If you guys have not already seen that post, me and Francesca and our agency are in the process

05:14.880 --> 05:23.120
of really trying to scale. And we are looking for people who have websites, projects that are

05:23.120 --> 05:28.960
ranking, that are producing leads, but that do not have clients yet. Maybe you guys have built them

05:29.040 --> 05:33.200
and you've tried to get a client. You haven't been able to. They're getting leads, whatever the case

05:33.200 --> 05:41.040
is. And you want to turn those into cash because you now, first and foremost, if you, I encourage

05:41.040 --> 05:44.560
you to keep your assets, right? Because an asset is something that's going to pay you again and

05:44.560 --> 05:48.720
again and again. And if all you need is a renter, I want you to keep trying to get them in. I don't

05:48.720 --> 05:53.440
want you guys to do this, to hook me up. I'm talking about those of you that may have a

05:53.440 --> 05:58.160
website that you've tried to sell it. You can't sell it, whatever the case is, or maybe you need

05:58.160 --> 06:03.840
some quick cash. I want you to message Francesca, let her know. Now this needs to be a website that

06:03.840 --> 06:08.960
is consistently producing leads that does not have a business owner. Okay. It's ranking and

06:08.960 --> 06:13.280
producing leads, not with ads, because guys, I can go set up my own. We have our own projects

06:13.280 --> 06:17.680
running with ads. I'm talking about projects that are already ranking that do not have clients that

06:17.680 --> 06:24.240
you want to potentially turn into cash. And by the way, we are going to make an offer to you. If we

06:24.240 --> 06:28.160
look at it, it looks good. We'll make an offer to you. And we're going to make a fair offer, right?

06:28.160 --> 06:32.160
If you don't have a client, it's not going to be worth near what it's going to be worth with a

06:32.160 --> 06:36.080
client. But I don't want your website as a client because I can go find a client, right? That's what

06:36.080 --> 06:40.080
I do. It's not that difficult. But if you are somebody that has a project that is ranking,

06:40.080 --> 06:45.200
has leads coming in, then message Francesca if you're interested in possibly offloading that.

06:45.200 --> 06:50.240
Okay. Last thing I want to mention, guys, is we are in the process of outlining version 3.0 of our

06:50.240 --> 06:54.400
training. So this will be the third time that we've actually shot the training. We're outlining

06:54.400 --> 06:59.360
right now, looking to shoot it and finalize it in quarter one of next year. So don't get too,

07:00.080 --> 07:02.560
I don't want everyone to ask me every five seconds when it's going to be done.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.240
Where there's a few things that we're testing, there's a few things that we're making sure,

07:06.240 --> 07:14.880
like for example, we are actually trying a new strategy, a new kind of wrinkle to our ads set up

07:14.960 --> 07:22.160
and our ads process, which we are now in the week, probably six of testing. And we're probably going

07:22.160 --> 07:26.000
to be doing it for three, three, four more weeks. That's going to be something that we include in

07:26.000 --> 07:30.480
version 3.0. I'm bringing this up because if you guys have things, feedback, suggestions,

07:31.120 --> 07:37.040
please DM me and fix it Felix on a group message and let us know. But we like, I'm not going to

07:37.040 --> 07:40.880
sit here and pretend like it's perfect. I know it's not perfect. There's things that have changed.

07:40.880 --> 07:44.480
There's things that I'm doing differently that I wasn't doing. We understand that there's a

07:44.480 --> 07:49.120
few things that may be a little bit confusing that we didn't realize. So rather than making like

07:51.120 --> 07:56.640
a post that says, oh, I don't understand this, this and this, just message us and we're going

07:56.640 --> 08:00.960
to add that to the outline. It is okay if you guys ask questions, but we would just appreciate

08:00.960 --> 08:05.120
the feedback and just know that we're working on it. We hear your feedback. We're excited to make

08:05.120 --> 08:10.800
the version 3.0 and there's also going to be a 4.0 and a 5.0 and probably a 10.0 because we're

08:10.800 --> 08:13.680
never going to be done with this business because I'm in this business just like you guys are in

08:13.680 --> 08:19.360
this business. Okay. That said guys, let's go into the call today. Let's talk about taxes. Let's

08:19.360 --> 08:24.000
talk about how to save money. Let's talk about how to keep as much money as possible that we're

08:24.000 --> 08:27.200
actually making. So I want to give you a little context. My buddy, Cale Goodman is going to be

08:27.200 --> 08:35.280
joining me here in about two minutes. Cale is a guy I met back in 2016. Ironically, I met Cale

08:35.280 --> 08:40.240
right when I started my agency, right when I started doing my own ranking, right? And this

08:40.240 --> 08:45.360
is at the point where I was just trying to get clients and I didn't understand what industries

08:45.360 --> 08:49.600
to go into, what a good city looked like, what a good niche looked like. And I was literally in

08:49.600 --> 08:53.280
the process of reaching out to all my buddies. Hey, do you know anybody that owns a business?

08:53.280 --> 08:57.520
Do you know anybody that owns a business? And I got introduced to Cale Goodman. We went and actually

08:57.520 --> 09:05.200
had sushi with another buddy of mine and he owns this amazing company called Easier Accounting.

09:05.200 --> 09:09.920
Now, I didn't realize at the time this probably wasn't the best industry to generate leads doing

09:09.920 --> 09:13.840
the method that we use, the rank and rent method. But you know what? I was out there just making

09:13.840 --> 09:18.720
offers, trying to get money coming in the door. So we met for lunch. He said, hey, come by the office.

09:18.720 --> 09:23.680
I went to the office and I sat in front of him and three of his, sorry, two partners, so three

09:23.680 --> 09:28.320
total people across from me. And I pitched them on this idea of doing rank and rent,

09:28.320 --> 09:33.520
building a website, ranking it and sending them leads. And when I walked out of that meeting,

09:33.520 --> 09:38.560
I walked out with a thousand dollar check and he shook my hand and he put his faith in me,

09:38.560 --> 09:43.840
said, go get me some leads. Now, I didn't do a flat fee deal. I did like a paper lead, whatever.

09:43.840 --> 09:48.240
And to be very honest, I got him a few leads and I knew it wasn't going to work. He knew

09:48.240 --> 09:53.760
it wasn't going to work. He was cool about it. He gave me a chance and I didn't know that that

09:53.760 --> 09:58.880
wasn't the greatest. Now, funny enough, I actually generated leads. I had a website called like

09:58.880 --> 10:04.880
reddesertaccounting.com, something like that. And leads actually came in. The issue was they

10:04.880 --> 10:08.320
weren't the type of leads that he was looking for because he has a very specific type of person

10:08.320 --> 10:13.600
he wants to work with and that he does the best with. And so it wasn't the best use of

10:13.600 --> 10:18.880
the rank and rent model. However, that's the first thing. A couple of years later, that was 2016,

10:18.880 --> 10:25.600
2017 guys, or sorry, end of 2016. Many of you guys know I went and tried to start a software company.

10:25.600 --> 10:29.520
I thought I was too cool for school. I thought I was too cool for the rank and rent model. I

10:29.520 --> 10:34.160
went and tried to start a software company, which I failed miserably at. After that was done,

10:34.160 --> 10:40.240
end of 2017, July, end of July, I started getting into SEO. I needed to pay the bills. I needed to

10:40.240 --> 10:44.720
pay the bills. I was trying to get money coming in and I needed SEO money because I needed as

10:44.720 --> 10:50.320
much as possible. I needed to keep, you know, those high margin deals. Well, a few months after,

10:50.320 --> 10:56.640
maybe six months after I got really heavy into that SEO, you know, aspect pitching deals and

10:56.640 --> 11:02.240
everything, I had a guy that I was partnering with on this SEO stuff. And I said to him, I said,

11:02.240 --> 11:06.800
hey, I know these guys, let's go meet with them. It's going to be tough. You know, the SEO in this

11:06.800 --> 11:13.120
space is difficult. And there we were, what is a year and a half later, sitting at the same table,

11:13.120 --> 11:19.440
this time pitching an SEO deal. And I will be, I'm happy to tell you guys, I walked out of that deal

11:19.440 --> 11:27.360
with a $4,000 per month retainer doing their SEO. And we did that for about six months, I believe.

11:27.360 --> 11:32.400
And then this guy, Cale called me and he's like, dude, I'm doing the math here. I'm thinking I'm

11:32.400 --> 11:36.880
just hiring somebody because I'm paying you guys like 4,000 bucks a month. So he's like, I just

11:36.880 --> 11:41.120
want to let you know, you guys have been great. Said, no problem, man. I totally get it. Obviously,

11:41.120 --> 11:45.200
it killed me to hear that, but I was like, whatever. And funny enough, he ended up taking my

11:45.200 --> 11:49.600
partner. My partner called me. He's like, dude, I need something that's very, that's like more stable.

11:49.600 --> 11:53.760
He's like, I think I'm going to apply for this job. So they ended up basically pulling him out

11:53.760 --> 11:58.800
of my hand and hiring him for that retainer plus a little bit of money. And that was it.

11:58.800 --> 12:04.080
We've maintained a great relationship over the years and he's just a super cool dude. I'm excited

12:04.080 --> 12:09.840
for you guys to actually get to know him, get some tips, get some tips and tricks, some strategies

12:09.840 --> 12:15.920
from him. And I want to say one thing. What I've learned about accounting is this can either make

12:15.920 --> 12:20.720
you or break you. I was sitting with a guy that's worth over a hundred million dollars and he said

12:20.720 --> 12:25.680
to me repeatedly, he said, it's not about what you make. It's about what you can keep. The second

12:25.680 --> 12:29.840
thing my dad always, something my dad always used to tell me is he said, there's two things that you

12:29.840 --> 12:33.680
do not want to be cheap about. And this is somebody taught him this. It's your attorney

12:33.680 --> 12:37.920
and it's your accountant because you never want to scrimp on that. And so guys, from the day that I

12:37.920 --> 12:43.200
started making money on my own, I've been paying professionals. I've never tried to do attorney

12:43.200 --> 12:47.440
work on my own. I've always paid someone to start a set up my businesses, whatever. And I've always

12:47.440 --> 12:52.880
paid an accountant to keep my books. I've spent, you know, heaven knows how much money on it, but

12:52.880 --> 12:58.320
I know I've made five, 10 X what I've spent. So I'm excited. I'm going to be Kaelin right now.

12:58.320 --> 13:04.480
And guys, the very last thing I'll say, if I heard somebody say this a few years back and it really

13:04.480 --> 13:11.520
resonated with me, if you want to make professional money, you need to treat this business professionally.

13:11.520 --> 13:14.960
The reason some of you guys are making side hustle money is because you're treating this

13:14.960 --> 13:19.040
like a side hustle. The reason I make professional money doing this is because I treat this

13:19.040 --> 13:23.680
professionally. I don't mess around with this. This is my business. This is my baby. I don't,

13:23.680 --> 13:28.560
I'm not freaking doing this for my mom's basement. And even if I was, I'm treating this as if I'm

13:28.560 --> 13:35.280
sitting at a skyscraper in a corner office. If you want to make professional money,

13:35.280 --> 13:39.360
treat this professionally. And this is a way that you can do that. So let me bring Kaelin

13:39.360 --> 13:43.440
really quick and we will get right into this call. One second. Let me see where he's at.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.800
Hold on. There we go.

13:56.400 --> 14:00.000
All right. Let's see if these guys can hear me. Kael, let me know if you can hear me, bro.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.240
Got double Kael. I think it's Kason coming on with him.

14:07.440 --> 14:13.040
Hold on. One sec. Oh, there he is. What's up, bro?

14:13.920 --> 14:18.080
Dude, we're trying out something new today. We got the, like, the vibe board up over here

14:18.080 --> 14:23.280
so we can share some stuff with you guys over there. We got super cool stuff for everybody

14:23.280 --> 14:28.320
today and we're excited to be here. Amazing. Kason, what's up, bro? How are you?

14:28.320 --> 14:32.480
I'm good, dude. Are you guys trying to join from another link as well? It says something's

14:32.480 --> 14:39.120
connecting the audio. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. Cool. I'll grab it. Yeah. No, no, no. You're good. You're

14:39.120 --> 14:42.800
good. I just want to make sure there wasn't somebody else. So, Kael, what's up, bro? How

14:42.800 --> 14:47.280
you doing? I'm doing great, man. Thanks for having me on today. For sure, man. I'm stoked

14:47.280 --> 14:52.640
about this. I was just kind of giving a little preface introduction and told everyone that when

14:52.640 --> 14:59.440
I first started doing this business, I came in and I was pitching you and I think it was JD

14:59.440 --> 15:06.240
and Trevor. And yeah, you had faith in me. You gave me a chance, which I appreciated. And then

15:06.240 --> 15:11.520
we did an SEO deal together and you stole my partner, Corey, which is cool.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.480
That was cool. By the way, you just muted yourself on accident. Hold on.

15:18.720 --> 15:23.280
Yeah, just unmute yourself. Okay. There you go. I can hear you now. You're good. You're good.

15:24.160 --> 15:31.200
Okay. Oh, you have that one. Okay. So yeah, just me, one of them. And let me know. You can hear me,

15:31.200 --> 15:36.960
right? No, we're good. We can hear you just fine. Do you hear an echo? Yeah, I'm here to echo.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.640
You're good. You're good. Take care of it. And then we'll go through. So guys, real quick,

15:43.360 --> 15:48.560
while they're getting that stuff set up, I want you guys, if you have questions related to taxes

15:49.120 --> 15:54.240
and accounting related to this business, you guys can start dropping them in the comments.

15:54.240 --> 15:59.360
We'll hit those at the end. Kael, you still got me? Oh, shit. I can't hear you now, bro.

16:01.520 --> 16:11.360
Dude. There we go. I could see myself twice. I can see myself on the, but I can't hear an

16:11.360 --> 16:15.120
echo anymore. So I think we're good there. Beautiful. Can you hear me? Yeah, we're good,

16:15.120 --> 16:23.760
but no echo. So we're good. Sweet, dude. So yeah, that's dope, dude. So let's start off by just

16:23.760 --> 16:30.000
doing like an intro, how the hell you got here into this space. Then I know you guys got some

16:30.000 --> 16:34.720
stuff you want to share. I've also got some things that are interesting for me to kind of just throw

16:34.720 --> 16:41.200
out there, but yeah, let's just kind of, let's start rolling. All of it, man. So to give you a

16:41.200 --> 16:46.800
little background. Well, first of all, uh, me and Nick, you know, we, we talked for, I don't know,

16:46.800 --> 16:50.080
dude months at the gym. That's where I first met you is at the gym. And then you were kind of like,

16:50.080 --> 16:54.720
dude, I want to come in and show you some stuff. Right. And then he built a kind of a competing

16:54.720 --> 16:58.960
company that did generate us leads. What wasn't it? It was just a competing company on our,

16:58.960 --> 17:03.200
on a Google. Anyway, the whole thing worked is all I was going to say. And so it's kind of cool

17:03.200 --> 17:07.280
to see years later, how you spun this up. You're teaching other people how to do it. You're getting

17:07.280 --> 17:12.160
people results. And I really like it because it's a business model where people can get out and they

17:12.160 --> 17:16.240
can make money. Anybody's got a little hustle to them and anyone's got like, you know, some,

17:16.240 --> 17:19.680
some charisma about them. Like they can get out and find these deals all day long with people,

17:19.680 --> 17:24.160
you know? And so, um, so I really like it because you can instantly be what they call open for

17:24.160 --> 17:28.320
business, which is a tax term. I want to talk about with these guys today as well, which is huge to

17:28.320 --> 17:33.440
open up a ton of tax savings, no matter what happens with business. And so, um, so that's kind

17:33.440 --> 17:36.480
of a really cool thing that I like about your business model as well as like, literally you

17:36.480 --> 17:42.080
can get people instantly open for business by IRS terms to help them really keep a ton of money in

17:42.080 --> 17:48.880
the building phases. And so, uh, but, uh, but to give a little background, dude, so I, um, I,

17:48.880 --> 17:54.320
so I actually came from a household growing up where all we did was fight about money in our

17:54.320 --> 17:59.200
house, right? My parents were like constantly battling because my dad was a self-employed

17:59.200 --> 18:04.800
blue collar contractor, he did siding, rain gutters, you know, solve a patient. He's just a,

18:04.800 --> 18:09.920
just a contractor guy, but he was an independent guy. He had a crew, um, and he never understood

18:09.920 --> 18:15.520
the money side of business and he never wanted to prioritize it. Um, so all I heard about my entire

18:15.520 --> 18:20.720
household, my whole, my whole upbringing was, you know, this fight about the IRS, right? And so my

18:20.720 --> 18:26.160
mom, uh, and dad were constantly fighting about money. And eventually after years and years and

18:26.160 --> 18:30.000
years of them always fighting about this IRS, I didn't know what it was. I'm just a kid, right?

18:30.000 --> 18:34.880
But as I got older, I started understanding more. And then the IRS finally, after a while, they

18:34.880 --> 18:39.360
came in and started taking things, right? So, um, they, they literally came in and leaned my dad's

18:39.360 --> 18:46.880
house. Um, they levy did his bank account. So I remember I helped him finish a job up in Salt Lake

18:46.880 --> 18:52.320
City. Um, just as a young kid, I think I was like 13 or something working on a big apartment complex

18:52.320 --> 18:57.280
up there with him. He was so excited to come put this big check in the bank, pay all his guys,

18:57.280 --> 19:01.680
pay some money to the IRS because they'd been on his back before the second he put that money in

19:01.680 --> 19:06.400
the bank account before he could use any of it. Boom, levy took it all out. He's like some $40,000

19:06.400 --> 19:12.080
check, you know? And so now they're levy his bank accounts. They're leaning his home. My mom goes

19:12.160 --> 19:19.440
and gets a job as a grocery, you know, a checker at Albertsons here in town. And they end up

19:19.440 --> 19:23.360
garnishing your paychecks after like a month or two of working there. And so now, now they just

19:23.360 --> 19:27.920
really squoze my parents to where like literally my dad had to just work for cash under the table,

19:27.920 --> 19:31.120
you know? So in my mind, I was like, why would anybody want to be a business owner? I don't

19:31.120 --> 19:35.920
ever want to do that. Like, heck no. And so, um, but I always wanted to make money. I always want

19:35.920 --> 19:39.360
to have a great, great life. I always wanted to have financial abundance. And so, you know,

19:39.360 --> 19:43.440
and I was just a hustler at heart. And so, uh, one of the best things that ever happened to me

19:43.440 --> 19:48.480
is I ended up getting recruited as a sales guy by a guy that owned a tax and accounting firm to come

19:48.480 --> 19:53.840
and do business development and sales with his entire, uh, accounting company. And so I got

19:53.840 --> 19:58.080
really good at that. I became his top guy. I really, because of my upbringing, really threw

19:58.080 --> 20:03.360
myself into it. And so I spent more time with the CPAs than I did the other sales guys, constantly

20:03.360 --> 20:08.720
just trying to learn as much as I possibly could, because I finally understood like, wow, the IRS

20:08.720 --> 20:12.960
didn't take everything from us. My dad just didn't understand it. He didn't want to put the

20:12.960 --> 20:17.840
effort into getting the knowledge and creating the systems and the habits around the money side of

20:17.840 --> 20:22.720
business, the tax side of business in order to really become successful. And so that gave me the

20:22.720 --> 20:26.400
courage to start my own business. And then it gave me the courage to start my own accounting firm

20:26.400 --> 20:32.320
and partner with some really great CPAs. And so here we are over 15 years later, and we've got

20:32.320 --> 20:38.400
an awesome accounting firm. We got multiple CPAs and EAs and accountants with masters

20:38.400 --> 20:42.640
that are in here serving our clients. And so our whole thing is like, Hey, we want to serve

20:42.640 --> 20:46.000
business owners the way they need to be served, right? Cause anybody can do it. My dad did where

20:46.000 --> 20:50.080
they went down, they just had a CPA and they brought them all their stuff every year and they

20:50.080 --> 20:53.440
guessed. And then they, and then they, the accountants really just doing what the business

20:53.440 --> 20:56.800
owner brings them. And then they ended up getting behind the IRS and now they're overwhelmed by it.

20:56.800 --> 21:01.840
So they ignore it and all these problems just, you know, start to compound, you know? And so

21:01.840 --> 21:07.120
that's basically what we try to avoid. And so even though our company has evolved and we've got

21:07.680 --> 21:12.480
companies that are 20, 30, 40, 50 million dollar companies that we do high level tax planning for,

21:12.480 --> 21:17.360
I have always stayed very passionate about helping people kind of in that startup mode. And they're,

21:17.360 --> 21:21.200
they're really just, you know, doing their first side hustle or they're, they're just throwing

21:21.200 --> 21:26.800
themselves into their first business. Cause I know that all the magic happens by helping them build

21:26.800 --> 21:32.080
the foundation correctly in the beginning stages. Because what I've seen, even with successful

21:32.080 --> 21:37.200
business owners is five, six, seven years in, they realize like, holy crap, man, I made

21:37.200 --> 21:42.720
a ton of mistakes. I didn't know I shouldn't have brought in a partner and we did an S corp together.

21:42.720 --> 21:47.360
I didn't know I should have, you know, had an LLC and just stayed a partnership there and then

21:47.360 --> 21:53.200
created an S corp later individually. I didn't know C corporations were a thing and that there's

21:53.200 --> 21:57.840
tax advantages to that once I hit certain levels and I have certain goals. And so, you know, and

21:57.840 --> 22:02.000
then what happens is they have to redo it. And so, and that's what, that's what we like to do is

22:02.000 --> 22:07.520
like really help entrepreneurs, like get the information they need, inspire them to start

22:07.520 --> 22:12.960
creating the right habits, tax wise, get the right foundation laid, you know, and, and that way as

22:12.960 --> 22:17.840
they scale, you know, cause everybody wants to scale, everybody wants to become really scalable.

22:17.840 --> 22:22.800
And it's like, they always focus on sales and marketing, you know, and then they focus on,

22:22.800 --> 22:27.440
I don't know why it's doing that. They focus on sales and marketing and then they focus on

22:27.440 --> 22:32.320
operations and then the money's part always comes last. And so we like to inspire people like,

22:32.320 --> 22:37.280
Hey, do it all right now. Like get the foundation laid so you can focus on those things and not

22:37.280 --> 22:42.240
scaling your money doesn't become an interruption of your business growth, you know, later when you

22:42.240 --> 22:47.520
are trying to, you know, when you are doing great numbers, now it's super costly to redo everything

22:47.520 --> 22:52.320
later on. So, so anyway, that's kind of a background as well as like what I want to talk about with,

22:52.320 --> 22:55.280
with your community today is like really laying that foundation properly.

22:56.480 --> 23:02.880
Okay, bro. And yeah, what I said right before you hopped on is I heard somebody say this a couple

23:02.880 --> 23:07.680
years ago, they said, you know, a lot of people that do side hustles, they get frustrated because

23:07.680 --> 23:12.960
they're just making like a little bit of money. And it's like, if you want to make professional

23:12.960 --> 23:18.000
money, you need to treat this professionally. And so a lot of times we get into this, we treat it

23:18.000 --> 23:21.440
like with something we're doing out of our mom's basement. And even if you are literally in your

23:21.440 --> 23:26.400
mom's basement, or something equivalent, you could still treat this like you're sitting at the, you

23:26.400 --> 23:30.720
know, at Kale's office at a corner office, and then this really nice building. But this is one

23:30.720 --> 23:36.000
of those things where you need to have your, your, your, what is it, your I's dotted your T's crossed.

23:36.000 --> 23:43.840
And so fortunately, my dad was always, he told me this, he said, never be cheap on your accountant

23:43.840 --> 23:49.280
or your attorney. And so even when I was barely making money, like when I first started doing

23:49.280 --> 23:54.320
business, I always like I set up my first business, I had it done with a professional,

23:54.320 --> 24:00.080
like I never was. He always put that in my head. He's always, you're the you know, are you going

24:00.080 --> 24:04.960
to lose the most money is like, I'm like, where he's like doing the turbo tax and the QuickBooks.

24:04.960 --> 24:08.960
And so I never even questioned it because he ingrained it. But I know that that's not how

24:08.960 --> 24:14.160
everybody grew up. I know a lot of my friends grew up. It's like, Dad, you know, he was a school

24:14.160 --> 24:19.280
teacher. And so he just went on the turbo tax and it was 200 bucks. Like, no, you just lost money

24:19.280 --> 24:25.040
because you're an idiot. So anyway, that said, dude, I want to give you the floor to do some

24:25.040 --> 24:30.880
training on what you want to talk about ways that people can save money in 2024. And then if there's

24:30.880 --> 24:34.640
time left, I've got questions on other people got questions. But yeah, let's, let's get

24:35.520 --> 24:40.240
I would definitely love to open up some q&a. And I know Casey will jump in here as well. Because

24:40.240 --> 24:44.000
I mean, Casey's on the front lines all the time, man. He's always staying up to date on

24:44.080 --> 24:49.360
cool deductions and tax strategies that are counted as the CPAs are, are, you know,

24:49.360 --> 24:56.080
implementing for our clients. And so but but yeah, dude, to get to get kind of started. I mean,

24:56.080 --> 24:59.920
that is that is one thing I want to start off by saying, I kind of iterated it there in the intro

24:59.920 --> 25:05.760
was like, really, we want to we want to get to a point of like financial security and abundance

25:05.760 --> 25:10.960
as quickly as possible. And we and we want to scale to that to that level as soon as possible.

25:11.040 --> 25:18.240
And so obviously, one thing I've realized with entrepreneurs is, do they they don't ever just

25:18.240 --> 25:23.360
want one stream of income, they want multiple streams of income. And so what happens is,

25:24.080 --> 25:27.360
they they end up creating all these different buckets of income. And then they sometimes

25:27.360 --> 25:31.120
end up partnering on things like, for example, your business model is a beautiful business model.

25:31.840 --> 25:35.680
There might be opportunities in the marketplace that come up like, hey, maybe they're sending

25:35.680 --> 25:39.760
you more business and they've created a new stream of income, or maybe they end up building

25:39.760 --> 25:42.960
a team where they're out there helping a bunch of other people in their community do what you're

25:42.960 --> 25:47.280
doing. And you know, I mean, so it's like, there's all these different streams of income entrepreneurs

25:47.280 --> 25:51.200
do once they start making more and more money, like, how can I scale? How can I scale? And so

25:52.160 --> 25:55.520
let me see if I can bring up this one slide, I want to kind of do a little training on

25:56.560 --> 25:59.600
Let me give you co host, then you want to share your screen? Are you going to show it on that

25:59.600 --> 26:05.600
screen over there? Let me see how it looks real quick on on just the laptop. Okay, cool,

26:05.600 --> 26:09.520
because either way, I'm not used to the whiteboard thing, man. I'm like,

26:09.520 --> 26:13.200
this is so interesting, you know, but I want to learn it.

26:14.160 --> 26:18.800
It's all good, man. And I'm gonna do this. Hold on, let me see if I can give you like

26:18.800 --> 26:29.920
spotlight so that it shows just your face alone. Yeah. Okay, it's spotlighting the whiteboard.

26:30.560 --> 26:37.040
But I'm getting, I'm getting that like 1000 different tiles showing into eternity, you know,

26:39.040 --> 26:42.960
let me try some here. Because I want to walk people through kind of a

26:45.520 --> 26:57.200
current. Let's go to your slide. Yeah, I want to show people a current kind of how I'm personally

26:57.280 --> 27:04.640
structured. And then kind of give them a good I want I want people to understand kind of now and

27:04.640 --> 27:10.960
the future and why it's so beneficial for them to get all structured properly, you know, so

27:10.960 --> 27:16.320
can you see that slide? Yeah, that's that's I can see it. Guys, let me know in the comments,

27:16.320 --> 27:21.120
you can see it. I can see it pretty well. So I think I think it's pretty solid. Yeah.

27:21.120 --> 27:26.400
Okay, so I'll walk you through some of this stuff. This is this is important stuff. I

27:28.640 --> 27:32.400
really hit home, I've went and talked to some groups before. And you know, we spend a lot of

27:32.400 --> 27:38.080
time on this, because, you know, really, the first understanding that we have to create as we are

27:39.200 --> 27:43.040
starting a business is like, there's there's different kinds of income that the IRS looks

27:43.040 --> 27:47.760
at, right? And one of them is, you know, active income, which is all your business activities,

27:47.760 --> 27:51.760
and then business owners, they either want to go create multiple streams of income, because they

27:51.760 --> 27:55.920
get good at business, or they want to start diversifying and building passive streams of

27:55.920 --> 28:00.560
incomes, you know, which is buying assets and, you know, things that are taxed at capital gains

28:00.560 --> 28:04.480
rates. And so we have to we have to have an understanding of like, what, what am I making?

28:04.480 --> 28:08.080
What am I doing right now? It's like, okay, well, you're doing active income with your business

28:08.080 --> 28:11.440
model, Nick, like this, what they're doing, they're doing active income. But as you if you want to

28:11.440 --> 28:15.120
become scalable, you really want to create security, you know, one day, you're going to

28:15.200 --> 28:19.200
have to start investing. Well, when you start buying stocks that you hold for over a year,

28:19.200 --> 28:23.680
you start buying assets that you hold for over a year, like rental properties or whatever,

28:23.680 --> 28:28.480
the appreciation on those gains is taxed at passive income. Well, we don't want that to pass

28:28.480 --> 28:32.720
through to us as active income, you know, because then we're going to get taxed at earned income

28:32.720 --> 28:38.560
rates, you know, which can be, you know, well, it can be 15% up to 37%, right? Plus your stake

28:38.560 --> 28:43.120
taxes. And, you know, and then there's a lot of double taxation, we got to look out for on the

28:43.120 --> 28:48.240
active income streams as well. Like right now, when you're not making any money, or you're just

28:48.240 --> 28:52.960
starting to make a little bit, you don't obviously start paying taxes until you start becoming

28:52.960 --> 28:58.960
profitable. Okay, once you become profitable, if you're just set up as a single member LLC,

28:58.960 --> 29:03.440
or a sole proprietorship, which is just doing business in your name, you know, the income's

29:03.440 --> 29:08.240
all passing through to you directly, and you're going to get taxed your earned income rates,

29:08.240 --> 29:13.520
which is the 15 to 30%, plus your state taxes, if you're in a state where there's state taxes,

29:13.520 --> 29:17.600
and then you're going to also pay the self-employment taxes. And the self-employment

29:17.600 --> 29:23.680
taxes are basically the, the social security for both the employee and the employer. Well,

29:23.680 --> 29:27.120
they're saying, well, hey, you're self-employed, it's all flowing through to you. So you need to

29:27.120 --> 29:34.160
pay all of it. So it ends up being 15.3%. Right? So, and so, so people start doing the math,

29:34.160 --> 29:39.680
and they're like, man, like, I'm paying 40, 45, 50% in taxes on this income that's flowing

29:39.680 --> 29:43.440
through to me. Then they're like, I started this as a side hustle, so I could quit my job. They're

29:43.440 --> 29:46.720
like, man, I'm never gonna be able to quit my job when I'm, you know, literally having to give

29:46.720 --> 29:52.320
half of it back to the, to the government, you know? And so one of the biggest tax savings that

29:52.320 --> 29:58.000
we can create for people is helping them understand where to start and when the right time is to

29:58.000 --> 30:04.800
switch to an S corporation. Okay? But we don't want people to do it incorrectly. And so I built

30:04.800 --> 30:10.080
this little diagram to give people kind of an idea. And, and this is a little outdated. Some of these

30:10.080 --> 30:14.400
companies that have sold, like I'm not a part of RBO anymore. I've sold that. I sold you tax over

30:14.400 --> 30:19.600
here. I am still owner of these other companies. And then, you know, I have some other things like

30:19.600 --> 30:24.240
coffee shops now that me and my wife are doing it. So this is outdated. This isn't, this isn't my

30:24.240 --> 30:29.360
exact situation anymore. I need to jump in and update it one of these days. But if you look at,

30:30.720 --> 30:38.800
if you look at what we got going on right in the center, it says KG3 Corp. KG3 Corp is an S

30:38.800 --> 30:45.440
corporation. All these other entities are either LLCs or LLC partnerships. Down here, my rental

30:45.440 --> 30:51.840
properties at the bottom, those are all holding LLC companies. Okay? So some are flowing directly

30:51.840 --> 30:56.960
through me. Some are flowing directly to my corporation, which is then where I pay myself.

30:56.960 --> 31:03.120
And so a lot of people are asking question when they get started, like, do I even need to set up

31:03.120 --> 31:10.720
an LLC? Right? And I always tell people like, absolutely do. Like there is no reason why you

31:10.720 --> 31:16.000
shouldn't set up an LLC. An LLC doesn't really do a whole lot to save you money on taxes because

31:16.000 --> 31:21.920
it's taxed just like a sole proprietorship is. Okay? But a sole proprietorship, the money flows

31:21.920 --> 31:27.520
directly through you. Same with an LLC. And then there's also the S corporation. Okay? And so

31:27.520 --> 31:35.600
the S corporation is taxed as a corporation. The benefit of that is you don't have to pay the 15.3%

31:35.600 --> 31:41.280
self-employment taxes, but there's some rules. Like, first of all, you have to pay yourself a

31:41.280 --> 31:46.800
fair and reasonable salary. And what the IRS says is they say it's fair and reasonable. That's all

31:46.800 --> 31:50.080
they put in there. They don't give any stipulations or guidance on it. They say you just have to pay

31:50.080 --> 31:54.480
yourself a fair and reasonable salary for your duties of the job. So somebody could be, let's just

31:54.480 --> 32:03.280
give an example. Let's say you start this business and you decide, hey, I want to set up as an LLC.

32:03.280 --> 32:08.000
And here's the benefit of setting up as an LLC. First of all, you get to create separation between

32:08.000 --> 32:13.120
you and the business. Okay? So now we can establish a lot of really good habits, right? Like we can,

32:13.120 --> 32:17.600
you know, separate the business transactions from the personal transactions. We go down to our bank,

32:17.600 --> 32:22.080
we take our EIN, we set up the bank account numbers, totally separate from us. There's liability

32:22.080 --> 32:26.160
protection. If anyone tries to sue the business, they can't sue me as long as I don't do any

32:26.160 --> 32:30.960
commingling. If they try to sue me, they can't sue the business. So I've got separation between me

32:30.960 --> 32:34.880
and the business. So there's all these benefits. I tell people, absolutely, you should always set

32:34.880 --> 32:42.080
up an LLC. There's very rare situations that you should not set up an LLC, right? And so I always

32:42.080 --> 32:46.160
tell people, LLC is great, okay? And they're usually super affordable. Some states, they have

32:46.160 --> 32:50.800
high state fees, but most of the time they're super affordable. It's worth setting up just

32:50.800 --> 32:57.120
to establish the right habits and the separation for the legalities, okay? But we're still being

32:57.120 --> 33:01.360
taxed at earned income rates and we're still being taxed like a sole proprietorship. We're still

33:01.360 --> 33:05.920
liable to pay those self-employment taxes, but that doesn't matter until we're profitable,

33:05.920 --> 33:11.040
okay? Well, what pass-through means, Nick, is pass-through means the deduction, the income

33:11.040 --> 33:15.680
flows through directly to you and that's where you get taxed, but then so do all the deductions.

33:16.240 --> 33:23.520
So we like to teach people like, hey, set up an LLC, create as many tax deductions as possible.

33:23.520 --> 33:28.960
We don't want to become super profitable until we absolutely start outweighing all of the

33:28.960 --> 33:33.360
deductions that we possibly can. We want to pay as little as possible as far as taxes go.

33:34.960 --> 33:40.720
Anyway, so we like to set up the LLC to start, okay? And then we like to educate people. When

33:40.720 --> 33:45.760
is the right time to switch to an S corporation? Well, because an S corporation does have a little

33:45.760 --> 33:50.000
bit higher cost tax return and it has some compliance, things like setting up some payroll

33:50.000 --> 33:53.920
and there's a little payroll cost to pay yourself a fair and reasonable salary to get out of those

33:53.920 --> 34:00.080
self-employment taxes. We like to tell people like, hey man, as soon as you start outweighing

34:00.080 --> 34:06.000
all your deductions and you start getting to the point where you're making $20,000 a year profit,

34:06.000 --> 34:11.920
it's really beneficial to start looking at switching to an S corporation. But there's a

34:11.920 --> 34:17.120
lot of mistakes that happen along the way when people go to CPAs or attorneys to do this because

34:17.120 --> 34:22.240
a lot of times CPAs and attorneys, they're just looking at it as a tax law. They'll tell you to

34:22.240 --> 34:26.960
switch too soon or they'll tell you to switch too late because they're just looking at it from

34:26.960 --> 34:32.240
a taxation point. And so they're not looking at it like from a business owner perspective.

34:32.240 --> 34:37.600
And so a business owner perspective, we want to have sometimes multiple structures created to

34:37.600 --> 34:43.280
create the best tax savings opportunity and get out of the self-employment taxes, maximize as many

34:43.280 --> 34:50.080
deductions as we possibly can. So to break it down in kind of simple math, let's just say,

34:50.080 --> 34:54.480
easy for math, you go start the side hustle, you're a couple of years in, boom, you're making

34:54.480 --> 35:01.520
$100,000 a year profit. Well, you're probably going to end up paying about, on the profit,

35:01.520 --> 35:09.360
just as an LLC, you're going to end up paying $35,000 to $45,000 after the self-employment taxes

35:09.360 --> 35:15.920
directly to the IRS. And so that's a huge tax liability people don't want. But if you switch

35:15.920 --> 35:23.120
at the right time to an S corporation, well, then you're eliminating the 15.3% right off the top.

35:23.120 --> 35:27.760
And you've created the separation between you and the business to create a lot more different

35:28.720 --> 35:34.160
tax strategies to reduce the taxation even more. And so I built this diagram just to break it down.

35:34.160 --> 35:39.440
So I keep all of my partnerships and all of my single-member LLCs,

35:40.240 --> 35:45.840
all, which are all the ones that have the arrows pointing to the KG3 Corp. I keep all those LLCs.

35:45.840 --> 35:50.000
I don't switch any of them to S corporations. And then I flow them all to my S corporation,

35:50.000 --> 35:54.080
which is there where I pay my, that's where I pay myself a fair and reasonable salary. And that's

35:54.080 --> 35:59.920
where I end up taking most of my personal tax deductions that aren't tied to all my different

35:59.920 --> 36:05.040
partners and all my different business ventures. And so this is the foundation we like to lay with

36:05.360 --> 36:08.960
entrepreneurs early on so that they can gain an understanding of like,

36:11.520 --> 36:17.760
okay, when is the right time to switch to an S corporation? How can I flow my money to me without

36:17.760 --> 36:23.200
being double-taxed? And so this is the best way to do it, depending on your situation. Some people

36:23.200 --> 36:31.520
are in different situations. We've had people come to us where they have disability or they have a

36:31.520 --> 36:37.040
high-income earning spouse, or they have a partner that's overseas and so they need a S corporation.

36:37.040 --> 36:40.960
So there's different situations for different people that we have to take into consideration

36:40.960 --> 36:46.960
that we do consult on before we do anything. But this is like a good broad diagram that we built

36:46.960 --> 36:52.640
just to help people kind of understand the benefits of LLCs, creating separation, maximizing deductions,

36:52.640 --> 36:56.960
flowing it to you personally so you don't get double-taxed to keep majority of the money that

36:56.960 --> 37:07.600
you're making as a business owner. So just to understand your setup is KG3 is an S Corp

37:07.600 --> 37:14.160
and these other entities are LLCs that flow into KG3, but KG3 is what actually pays you.

37:15.120 --> 37:19.840
Yeah, exactly. And I know I like to paint this future picture, Nick, just to give people

37:19.840 --> 37:23.840
understanding of like, okay, like this seems like it could be a complex thing, but people are like,

37:23.840 --> 37:29.360
where can I start now? Do I need an LLC right now? And so I like to paint this picture

37:29.360 --> 37:35.600
for people because I don't want to see them make the mistakes that a lot of business owners make

37:35.600 --> 37:39.840
later when they do get to the point where they're like, hey, I'm starting to become profitable,

37:40.800 --> 37:47.680
and I have a partner and they go to talk to an accountant or a CPA and the CPA is like,

37:47.680 --> 37:53.040
well, you're going to save 15.3% by switching to an S Corp. Well, now your partner and you have

37:53.040 --> 37:57.360
an S Corp together, but now you guys have joined each other together on this corporation. When you

37:57.360 --> 38:03.200
didn't have to do that, you could have kept your business in LLC and you could have just each set

38:03.200 --> 38:08.880
up your own individual S corporations. And now you guys have the independence, right? So this

38:08.880 --> 38:13.760
partner over here can go and build other multiple streams of income and assets that flow to him.

38:13.760 --> 38:19.680
And you can go and build multiple streams of income separately, but you still have your thing

38:19.680 --> 38:24.960
together in the LLC, but you each have your own individual S corporations. And then that's

38:24.960 --> 38:29.600
where you kind of fully control your tax liability. And so that's like one of the biggest mistakes I

38:29.600 --> 38:35.360
see for people as they scale and grow a business and create multiple streams of income is they end

38:35.360 --> 38:41.920
up forming their S corporation when it's time to switch to an S corporation and they keep their

38:41.920 --> 38:47.280
partner on it. And so that's a big thing I like to educate people on the future side of things.

38:47.280 --> 38:51.600
But right now, while we're just getting started, I like people to understand the benefits of just

38:51.600 --> 38:59.120
getting an LLC, maximizing as many deductions as possible to keep as much money as you possibly can

38:59.120 --> 39:05.040
and then switch to an S corporation when the time is right based on you and then doing it properly

39:05.040 --> 39:11.680
by keeping it S corporation solely under you and not tying yourself to any partners with that

39:11.680 --> 39:15.120
down the road. So I like to paint that future picture, but then I like to help people

39:15.120 --> 39:20.080
understand the benefits of setting up an LLC right now for the legalities and all the tax

39:20.080 --> 39:24.400
incentives and the separation that they can create or the, you know, incentives that they

39:24.400 --> 39:29.600
do create by creating that separation. So anyway, does that make sense so far?

39:29.600 --> 39:33.600
Yeah, no, no, no. So, and I think it's smart because you guys, once you, you know, some of

39:33.600 --> 39:37.520
you guys are brand new to business, first time ever. And you realize what, like, I'm sure you

39:37.520 --> 39:42.640
were like this kale, but once you make money, then it's like the whole world's open and you're like,

39:42.640 --> 39:46.480
oh, I can make money here. I can make money. And the hardest part is just not getting shiny

39:46.480 --> 39:50.240
penny syndrome, to be honest, but you are going to find you're going to have multiple streams of

39:50.240 --> 39:55.280
income. That's just inevitable. One of the questions I had, and I think you just nailed

39:55.280 --> 40:01.200
it just to clarify. So your suggestion would be for anybody that's new, a good first step would

40:01.200 --> 40:08.080
be set up an LLC slash start getting as many tax deductions as possible. That's like an amazing

40:08.080 --> 40:13.920
first step. Totally, totally. And honestly too, like just having that entity set up properly,

40:13.920 --> 40:17.360
because here's the thing, like you're going to go out and you're going to start establishing like,

40:17.360 --> 40:23.520
okay, so I'm in digital landlords. I'm going out to find my first client. My first client,

40:23.520 --> 40:29.280
he's like, Hey, I want to, I want to pay you on my, my MX every month for this deal. We've created

40:29.280 --> 40:33.360
it. Well, now you need a merchant account and a merchant account doesn't want to, you know,

40:33.360 --> 40:37.680
they don't, you know, like, you know how merchant accounts are Nick, they're pain in the ass,

40:38.480 --> 40:42.400
you don't want to go set up a merchant account right now in your name. And then later be like,

40:42.400 --> 40:47.040
Oh, I actually need a new merchant account because I want to set up an LLC because I figured out,

40:47.040 --> 40:50.960
I have all this liability and I want all these tax incentives. And so then they're like, Oh,

40:50.960 --> 40:54.000
cool. Now you need a whole new merchant account. Now you're trying to make a new, you know,

40:54.000 --> 40:57.360
you're trying to make your, you're trying to season another merchant account, right? And you

40:57.360 --> 41:02.880
have to kind of start over. And so, you know, that's just like one example of like, why not

41:02.880 --> 41:08.160
just set up an LLC now if it's affordable for you, right? Cause like some States are 25 bucks,

41:08.160 --> 41:14.000
right? It's like 25 bucks, state filing fees, set up an LLC. Now you have an EIN number. Now

41:14.000 --> 41:18.880
you're protected legally. Now you can go start establishing bank accounts, merchant accounts,

41:19.600 --> 41:23.520
contracts, agreements with your clients, like all these things under this company,

41:23.520 --> 41:27.920
which is totally separate from you for the liability protection. And you can start taking

41:27.920 --> 41:32.640
all your deductions, keeping your books totally separate from you. There is no, as long as you

41:32.640 --> 41:37.520
really do a good job at setting up bank accounts and keeping those expenses separate, set up a

41:37.520 --> 41:41.680
QuickBooks account or set up some spreadsheets. And now you're keeping everything separate from

41:41.680 --> 41:47.280
you. And you're establishing really, really valuable habits early on in your business to not

41:47.280 --> 41:52.560
only help you keep more, more money that you make, but, but really like, you know, like you're,

41:52.560 --> 41:56.000
you're getting it all set up properly in the beginning stages. You don't have to redo it all

41:56.000 --> 42:01.360
later. Cause if you set up your structure, you're flowing correctly. And then later you figure out,

42:01.360 --> 42:08.400
you know what, I should, I should have been a C Corp or you know what I set up on as a C Corp

42:08.400 --> 42:12.240
on accident. Now I need to go back and do this in LLC. Well, now you have to go redo all those

42:12.240 --> 42:17.200
things. You have to get new merchant accounts, new agreements, new insurance policies, new bonds. If

42:17.200 --> 42:21.360
you need bonds with your state, new like everything under this new entity, because everybody views an

42:21.360 --> 42:25.360
entity as a totally separate entity. It's, it's not you anymore. And it's not this other company

42:25.360 --> 42:29.440
anymore. So if you have to redo it, it's like, man, that causes a huge interruption in your

42:29.440 --> 42:36.080
business. So starting with an LLC is very wise because one, if you're the sole owner of the

42:36.080 --> 42:40.480
business and you decide to switch it to an S corporation later on, you can, or if you decide

42:40.480 --> 42:45.680
to switch it to a C corporation later, you can, you know, and like, and that's, and that's necessary

42:45.680 --> 42:50.080
at times as well. If you scale really massively and you'd be end up becoming, you know, creating

42:50.080 --> 42:56.960
this business venture to something very large, you can switch to a C corporation and avoid paying

42:56.960 --> 43:03.280
taxes on the first $10 million that you make in the sell of your business later on. But you have

43:03.280 --> 43:08.560
to be a C corporation for five years. And so I tell you all that just because an LLC is very

43:08.560 --> 43:14.320
versatile. Start now, create the habits, get the EINs, get everything set up properly. And then later,

43:14.320 --> 43:19.600
if it makes sense, switch it to an S corp or set up a totally separate S corp if you have partners.

43:19.600 --> 43:24.400
And then later, you know, if you, if you decide I'm gonna switch it to a C corp, because I want to

43:24.400 --> 43:29.920
sell this business one day for 20, 30, 40, $50 million, well, you want to make that first 10 million

43:29.920 --> 43:35.200
totally tax free, you know, so there's all these cool benefits that you can do from being an LLC

43:35.840 --> 43:40.480
and switching later on or just adding entities like I've done for later on as well. So if I

43:40.480 --> 43:45.200
ever sold, for example, easier accounting, I would, I would, I would just flow that to my,

43:45.200 --> 43:49.760
my S corporation, or maybe by that time, hopefully I've switched to a C corporation,

43:49.760 --> 43:52.560
you know, so there's just there's benefits that you can do to, to

43:54.480 --> 43:59.040
just from starting as an LLC and keeping it very simple, and then understanding these things as you

43:59.040 --> 44:05.920
grow. We have a question that is pertinent to what you just said. It said, Stephen says,

44:06.560 --> 44:10.880
for those just starting out, do you recommend getting the LLC in the state you live in? He said,

44:10.880 --> 44:19.520
Pennsylvania for me as an example, having Google or YouTube this once I get ads now for all sorts

44:19.520 --> 44:25.360
of states, LLC is now algorithm. So yeah, should they do it in the state that they're in?

44:26.960 --> 44:31.440
I want to, I want to save people a ton of money by not getting scammed. Okay.

44:32.480 --> 44:36.720
When you get on the, when you get into business and you set up your first LLC,

44:36.720 --> 44:39.280
you're going to start getting a lot of advertisements and stuff saying, Hey,

44:39.280 --> 44:46.320
set up in Delaware, set up in Nevada. Okay. Now there's benefits to that. Okay. However,

44:46.320 --> 44:53.200
they don't usually apply. Okay. The IRS is if you ever get audited, they are going to treat you

44:53.200 --> 45:00.880
based on where your taxable presence is, you know, so if you're in Pennsylvania and you got sold by

45:00.880 --> 45:05.280
somebody who says, Hey man, set up a Nevada corporation because now you don't pay state taxes.

45:05.840 --> 45:10.880
That is a big audit waiting to happen that you will lose because they're going to be like,

45:10.880 --> 45:15.600
do you have no taxable presence in Nevada? Why are you trying to say you're in Nevada?

45:15.680 --> 45:20.960
You know, a business paying about a taxes plus as an LLC, it all flows to you directly anyway.

45:20.960 --> 45:25.680
So I get probably, I don't know, a hundred people every year that are like, Oh man,

45:25.680 --> 45:30.160
I set up in Nevada. I'm like, okay, cool. Why? And they're like, well, because I don't pay state

45:30.160 --> 45:34.560
taxes. I'm like, well, that's not true. Okay. Or I talk to people in California that come just like,

45:34.560 --> 45:38.640
Hey, I need some help fixing stuff and I need to set up in, in my, in California.

45:38.640 --> 45:42.160
And they're, and I'm like, okay, why? Well, I set up in Nevada and I got audited.

45:42.800 --> 45:46.240
California, they're like ninjas, man. They will find you. Cause if you put anyone on payroll

45:47.040 --> 45:51.440
in Pennsylvania or even yourself on payroll in Pennsylvania, but your entities in Nevada,

45:51.440 --> 45:56.000
there's like all these things that will trigger them to investigate that. Right. And so your

45:56.000 --> 46:03.680
taxable presence is where you're at because you're the business. And then as the organization grows

46:03.680 --> 46:08.480
and say, you remove yourself from the business and you, for example, wanted to move to Nevada

46:08.480 --> 46:14.080
and become a resident of Nevada or Puerto Rico or Florida or wherever there's no freaking state

46:14.080 --> 46:19.200
taxes. Well, then you can set up your S corporation as a consulting company, consulting your other

46:19.200 --> 46:23.840
entities and flow money to you without paying state taxes. Right. But you got to go live there.

46:23.840 --> 46:27.680
Right. Because now you're a consultant out of Florida, you're a consultant out of Nevada,

46:27.680 --> 46:31.360
you know, and you're, those are the states that you're actually in where your taxable presence

46:31.360 --> 46:37.520
is. And so I hate when people fall for that scam. Now there is anonymity. So in Delaware, Nevada,

46:37.520 --> 46:48.400
Wyoming, there is anonymity saying, well, sorry, can you, sorry. Oh, yeah. Okay. Sorry. My screen

46:48.400 --> 46:58.480
changed. Okay. And so I just have you on this conversation. Oh, just me and you. No, everyone

46:58.480 --> 47:02.320
can see you, but I just changed. You're the spotlight and I'll change it back when you're

47:02.320 --> 47:08.240
done talking. Okay. Okay. So basically, and so basically to save you a ton of money,

47:09.200 --> 47:12.800
I always tell people, like, dude, just set up in your state. That's going to save you a ton of

47:12.800 --> 47:19.440
money. Not it's going to, you know, avoid a ton of headaches later down the road. There are very

47:19.440 --> 47:24.640
cool strategies later that you can create by setting up entities in other states, but the whole

47:24.640 --> 47:29.840
anonymity laws are great because, you know, like it shields you. Like if somebody was going to sue

47:29.840 --> 47:34.400
you, like, let's just say you had a crazy ex wife. It's like, I know he's got like all these assets

47:34.400 --> 47:39.440
he's bought with this new business. He started in digital landlords. And like, let's say you wanted

47:39.440 --> 47:45.680
to hide a piece of land from a crazy ex spouse or, you know, or an ex business partner that's always

47:45.680 --> 47:50.960
trying to sue you or whatever, right? Like you could go set that up as just a holding LLC that

47:50.960 --> 47:59.040
owns land in Delaware or owns land or Wyoming or Delaware LLC that owns land in these other states,

47:59.040 --> 48:04.000
but it's just shielding you from them, but you got to set them up properly. And so most people,

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
even when they set up a Nevada or Delaware corporation, they don't even set them up properly.

48:08.000 --> 48:12.720
They end up setting them up and then they list themselves as an officer. So now they're public

48:12.720 --> 48:17.360
information anyway, you know, so you have to actually go set, like hire an attorney to set

48:17.360 --> 48:23.600
up the entity act as the officers of the corporation or the entity to totally shield you from the entity

48:23.600 --> 48:28.080
and then all of your ownership is basically created in agreements with that attorney or

48:28.080 --> 48:32.320
that law firm in order to fully shield it from you. So when you get to the point of where you're

48:32.320 --> 48:37.120
really wealthy and you're starting to set up trusts and land trusts, and you want to hide assets and

48:37.120 --> 48:42.480
really keep your name off of them, then you talk about like Nevada, Delaware, Wyoming entities,

48:42.480 --> 48:46.720
but when you're just starting a business, there's a money trail always leading back to you. Anyway,

48:46.720 --> 48:50.560
there's no, there's no point in you setting up out of state. So I know that gets a little bit long,

48:50.560 --> 48:55.920
but there is, you know, a lot of that I want to help people avoid by not getting scammed because

48:55.920 --> 48:59.520
I know there's companies out of Nevada and stuff that will call and sell you Nevada corporation

48:59.520 --> 49:04.800
and they'll charge you five, six, $7,000 for this corporate package, making it sound like you're

49:04.800 --> 49:09.040
never going to pay state taxes and you're going to have all these privacy laws and then they don't

49:09.040 --> 49:14.240
even set them up properly for the privacy laws. And so typically 99% of the time you don't want

49:14.240 --> 49:20.320
to set up out of your own state. Makes sense. Okay. So here's what I want to do really quick

49:20.400 --> 49:25.840
in our last few minutes. Because I know some people might hop off right at the,

49:25.840 --> 49:30.640
at the hour mark, whatever, but I have a couple of questions that people did ask that I think

49:30.640 --> 49:36.800
are really interesting that we should answer. But if like, I would suggest guys, this is what I did

49:36.800 --> 49:43.200
when I first got started is like, you got to talk to somebody, figure out what your situation is,

49:43.200 --> 49:48.480
what the best, you know, like way forward is whatever. So what's the best way that somebody

49:48.480 --> 49:51.840
didn't want to reach out and like, for example, we had a question just barely asking about a

49:51.840 --> 49:57.040
specific situation. How can people get in contact with you if they want to call and just kind of

49:57.040 --> 50:02.000
talk through their situation? Yeah, we put together a link just for digital landlords. I'm gonna have

50:02.000 --> 50:08.640
case and pull this up. So you guys can scan a QR code for it right now off the other screen.

50:08.640 --> 50:17.520
If you want to highlight that one, Nick, but that's just, it's really just a QR link going to

50:19.360 --> 50:23.600
link that we built just for the digital landlords community. That way it's tagged to your community

50:24.160 --> 50:28.800
where we give you guys a full, a free tax assessment, because I know we're getting in,

50:28.800 --> 50:33.360
we're in the fourth quarter of the year, first of all. So if you guys jump on the phone with our

50:33.360 --> 50:37.600
team, you know, we're not going to talk about just LLCs and everything. We're going to actually talk

50:37.600 --> 50:42.320
about you guys, your goals. We're going to talk a little bit about the future stuff, but we're

50:42.320 --> 50:46.640
going to talk about all the things you can do right now this year to start saving money because you

50:46.640 --> 50:52.000
started this business in this year, which means we can take a ton of deductions this year for your

50:52.000 --> 50:58.160
home office, for your vehicle, for your business bills, for your travel, for your laptop, your

50:58.160 --> 51:02.480
cell phone, your cell phone bills, your utilities, like all these things that you spend money on

51:02.480 --> 51:09.040
personally every year anyway. We want to show you guys how you can deduct those and pass it through

51:09.040 --> 51:13.040
to you. Whether you're an LLC, whether you're a sole proprietorship, whether you're a corporation,

51:13.680 --> 51:18.320
we want to help create an assessment for you guys where we can help you understand like, wow,

51:18.320 --> 51:23.200
this business is really benefiting me this year because when people go spend money to start a

51:23.200 --> 51:28.000
business, dude, they're like, holy crap, like it takes a little time before I start making a little

51:28.000 --> 51:32.640
bit of money. How can I get more money to put back into the business or how can I put more money back

51:32.640 --> 51:38.560
in my pocket to recoup costs? Well, when you set up an LLC and you strategize, all these deductions

51:38.560 --> 51:43.520
pass through to you directly anyway, so we offer this free assessment where people can literally,

51:46.720 --> 51:52.240
we can get on our phone with our team, we can look at your lifestyle, a broad estimate of all

51:52.240 --> 51:56.480
your expenses that we can now make deductible, show you how we're going to pass them through,

51:56.480 --> 52:03.280
and literally give you kind of a broad range of like, dude, we could save you this much money this

52:03.280 --> 52:09.920
year and an extra tax refund money from starting this business, right? So we can show people in

52:09.920 --> 52:17.760
this assessment how much money they can really save. Can I jump in real quick and say, we typically

52:17.760 --> 52:24.080
charge $400 for this assessment. We're doing it for free just for digital landlords. So like,

52:24.080 --> 52:29.840
if you're on this call right now, seriously, I can't tell you how many times I've been in an event and

52:29.840 --> 52:35.280
pulled up the QR code and thought, I need to go talk to my business partners. So I just open up

52:35.280 --> 52:39.360
the window thinking of it back to it when I get back in town and coordinate with my business

52:39.360 --> 52:44.320
partners. Don't do that. Click on this QR code right now. If you've got friends, family members,

52:44.320 --> 52:50.000
or business partners that are involved with you, just put your information in. My team will reach

52:50.000 --> 52:55.520
out. That way it's not an afterthought or something else you forget about. Now, another thing, I have

52:55.520 --> 53:01.440
not made this free offer since January. And the reason for that is last time I did this,

53:02.080 --> 53:10.800
people screenshot it, which is great. But there was 150 people at the event and we had 300

53:10.800 --> 53:19.360
scheduled appointments. And so it got a little bit crazy. So again, this is for you, your friends,

53:19.360 --> 53:25.680
family members, and business partners that are involved. But my team knows digital landlords

53:25.680 --> 53:31.280
very well. They understand your business. But again, we need to get on and really assess what

53:31.280 --> 53:36.960
your specific situation is and what your goals are to point you in the next right direction.

53:36.960 --> 53:42.400
And I promise you, you're going to leave this call with better information when you got on this call.

53:43.280 --> 53:47.280
So we're excited to work with you and appreciate everybody's time today.

53:47.840 --> 53:55.600
Yeah. One thing I want to say on that is I know for me, when I was looking to get a new attorney

53:55.600 --> 54:04.800
to potentially set up my trust, I reached out and I think it was like $250 or $300 an hour.

54:05.520 --> 54:13.440
And so I did pay that just to do an initial consultation. So what these guys are offering

54:13.440 --> 54:17.840
is like, hey, get on a call, let's look at your situation, see where you can save some money,

54:17.840 --> 54:24.240
see if you should set up an LLC. And anyway, I would just recommend if you guys want to make

54:24.240 --> 54:28.640
professional money, as I said in the beginning, you got to treat this professionally. So this is

54:28.640 --> 54:34.880
just a free thing that you guys can check out and then you can just go from there. And they

54:34.880 --> 54:38.560
just literally just scan that with their phone and then they can put in their information.

54:39.520 --> 54:47.680
I think I actually shared the link with you in our chat, Nick, if you want to share it in the

54:47.680 --> 54:53.120
comments or something, because I don't know if I have that ability, right? And if you want,

54:53.120 --> 54:56.720
we can give you the link, you can email us all of them or however you want to do it. But yeah,

54:56.720 --> 55:00.720
the QR code is in the same place. It's just for us to grab the information so we can reach out

55:00.720 --> 55:06.400
and just get you on the calendar. And then at the end of the day, man, it's like, yeah, we love

55:06.400 --> 55:10.880
earning business. We love helping people and going ahead and doing the structures for them. We do it

55:10.880 --> 55:15.040
all very affordably. But at the end of the day, we really want to provide enough value to where

55:15.040 --> 55:19.200
if somebody even can't hire us right now, it's like, we still want to head you in the right

55:19.200 --> 55:24.800
direction, give you direction this year to save as much money as possible so that maybe one day

55:24.800 --> 55:28.720
down the road, you want to come back and consult with us a little bit more. And so it's not a high

55:28.720 --> 55:33.920
pressure thing is all I'm saying. It's an awesome consultation, customized around you, your goals

55:33.920 --> 55:39.120
for the business and show you how we can to show you how we can help you save money now

55:39.120 --> 55:45.760
and down the road. So so I just barely dropped a link on the in the comments and I'll try to

55:45.760 --> 55:51.040
include the link as well. I'll edit the live and post it there. But yeah, we'll try to like email

55:51.040 --> 55:59.760
this out. Let me just see one more thing. Let's just answer two questions quick and then pop off

55:59.760 --> 56:05.040
you can. Is that okay, Kale? And as you want, man, we'll answer any questions you have.

56:05.680 --> 56:11.440
Okay, so real quick, Nick, Nick, I'm gonna ask this one because he's actually in St. George.

56:12.560 --> 56:17.760
He went to Utah Tech and stuff. And he said, random question, is your firm well versed in handling

56:17.760 --> 56:22.080
1031 exchanges? I'm seeking a reputable local firm to assist me in the process.

56:23.040 --> 56:27.920
Yep, we can do 1031s. We do cost tags, real estates, one of one of the fields that we do,

56:27.920 --> 56:31.840
we do a lot of work in and very, very well. Yeah, most of our most of our clients are

56:31.840 --> 56:37.520
e commerce or real estate, you know, and so, yeah, we're pretty well versed in all of that. So

56:37.520 --> 56:43.600
made absolutely. Okay, another one quick says, I set up my own LLC in Nevada and filed. This is

56:43.600 --> 56:50.480
more just a comment. Nevermind. This is just stating something. What this is a question

56:50.480 --> 56:54.880
that says from Juan says, What about creating a trust and having all the LLC inside the trust?

56:54.880 --> 56:58.480
And it sounded like based on what you were saying is that's like when you get into the big money,

56:59.120 --> 57:01.760
it's not necessarily right off the bat. But what do you want to talk about?

57:02.960 --> 57:08.000
Very, very careful, because there's a lot of different ways that trust or structure,

57:08.000 --> 57:13.280
there's a lot of different ways that the trust can own that business. And if it's done wrong,

57:13.280 --> 57:18.880
you're going to wind up paying trust taxes, which is the absolute highest tax rate that there is.

57:18.880 --> 57:24.240
And so that's one thing where great idea to be to be thinking at that higher level.

57:24.240 --> 57:31.920
But do not like, please do not do that without a lot of consultation with a tax professional

57:31.920 --> 57:41.440
and an attorney. Okay, I hope that answered. Let's see, Matt Torres said, he said, so starting

57:41.440 --> 57:47.680
the business as an LLC first, then later converting to an S corp or forming an S corp separately is a

57:47.680 --> 57:51.440
better strategy rather than leaving it as an LLC for the long run?

57:53.280 --> 57:58.560
Well, I mean, it depends. Like, so for example, if you do have a business partner, or, you know,

57:58.560 --> 58:03.280
like, let's just say you're a personal trainer, and you're an LLC, and then you meet somebody,

58:03.280 --> 58:05.840
and they're like, Hey, we should build gym equipment together. And you know,

58:05.840 --> 58:11.920
now you have a partnership and, you know, like, it's, it's, it's best to leave them all in LLCs

58:11.920 --> 58:16.880
when you start involving other people. And then just forming a totally separate S corporation

58:16.880 --> 58:22.400
that you now are flowing the money to. So for example, if me and Nick are in business together,

58:22.400 --> 58:28.480
and we go create an entity together, but we have all these other things, it's, it's not wise for us

58:28.480 --> 58:32.720
to go switch it to an S corp. Once it becomes profitable, it's wise for us to actually just set

58:32.720 --> 58:39.040
up our own S corporations. And instead of flowing the money directly to us, now we float to our S

58:39.040 --> 58:46.320
corporation, which is then where we pay ourselves. However, staying in LLC long term, that's totally

58:46.320 --> 58:53.840
fine. Until if you're even if you're a single member, until you start making 30, 40, $50,000

58:53.840 --> 58:59.840
a year and up, if then it's wise to switch it to an S corporation, right. And so, but

59:01.120 --> 59:05.360
if you know, you're just entrepreneurial, and you know, I'm going to go start other companies,

59:06.560 --> 59:11.600
I tell people it's best to just leave it in an LLC and go form a separate S corporation,

59:11.600 --> 59:15.920
and start doing that flow right now. Because you already know, you're going to go create these

59:15.920 --> 59:20.960
other LLCs, and you'd rather them all just flow to this S corporation. So, so it really just depends

59:20.960 --> 59:25.600
on your goals and the situations. If you know, like, I'm not going to do anything else, this is

59:25.600 --> 59:30.000
it, you know, then let's just switch that LLC to an S corp. You know, no, and you don't have

59:30.000 --> 59:34.800
any partners in it. No sweat. You're like, hey, I know, I just want to make 15, 20 grand a month,

59:34.800 --> 59:40.240
I'm good with that. You know, I just, you know, I don't want to have partners, I don't want it,

59:40.240 --> 59:44.240
I just want to keep it super simple. Well, then we can switch it to an LLC, LLC, to an S corp,

59:44.240 --> 59:48.960
and you get the same tax savings, you know. And so, so it really just depends on you, your situation.

59:48.960 --> 59:56.000
But I hope that answers the question. It just there is somebody. Yeah, I think it just I think

59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.520
if anyone has questions that specific like that, just jump on and talk to case and talk to kale,

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:06.800
they'll answer it for your situation. So it's pretty simple. The other thing, this is a side

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:13.280
note that I never realized is like, down the road, if you guys want to, you know, buy real estate

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:20.000
with your company or whatever qualify for certain things, when if you're LLC, or your business is

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.480
like brand new, I mean, it's really, really difficult. So you want to get it set up now,

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:29.760
get it seasoned, get however many years of tax returns, because they're going to look at a brand

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:34.480
new business. And basically, you know, they're, they're not even going to consider it. So

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.800
that's another thing that you you have to you don't even think about these things until you

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.760
get in a situation, you're like, man, I wish I would have set that up five years ago.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.800
Yeah, I always tell people when you set up an LLC, and this is another whole benefit of why you

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.440
should set them up early on, instead of waiting, is because you can you go get a DUNS number,

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:55.680
you start building credit to your corporation. And like, you know, and there's a lot of misleading

01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:00.160
information out there, like, oh, yeah, once you set up, you know, you get corporate credit, you can

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.640
just transfer all the debts to the you know, off you to the business, and you're not liable to pay

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.720
them anymore. And it's like, that stuff's not true. There's, there's always like, a way it's

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:13.200
going to come back on you if you try and like, just walk away from a debt or something. But

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.640
there is a ton of benefits to corporate lines of credit, even if you are a personal guarantor,

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.560
there's loans you can get just through the company where you're not a signer on them.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:28.160
And so and sometimes it takes a good couple years to really season an entity before

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:33.120
banks or institutions will give you money through the corporation. So anyway, that's another benefit

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:39.200
of starting to set up an LLC now is you can open up more lines of credit and access to capital

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:46.320
through that entity by starting to establish some credit through it. Beautiful. I'll say this guys,

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.920
and what I'll try to do, Kay, I'll try to get an email put together and send it out to everyone

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.920
that missed this. But the thing that I like about these guys, for everyone that's watching this is

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.840
that, you know, a lot of times you deal with accountants, or you deal with these type of

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:03.600
firms, it's just like that, that old guy that's friends with your dad. And you guys are actually

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:09.680
business owners that understand business and accounting. And so I think that's important,

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.840
because I've had you know, I had an accountant for a while when I got started, he used to do my dad

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:19.840
stuff on the farm and everything. And he was good, but you had to tell him, hey, what about this?

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:25.280
What about this? What about this? He was an accountant, he was just like one of those purists,

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.440
he didn't really know business, if I don't even think he was making that much money, although he

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:34.320
knew the accounting, he wasn't a business owner. So that's one benefit with these guys is they're

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.200
actually business owners that happen to know accounting very well. So anyway, we're going to

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:45.360
put together an email, I did drop the link. And we will, yeah, guys, just jump on, check out what

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.480
they can do. If anything, suggestions, if nothing else, you guys get some ideas and go from there.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.800
Yeah, no, we appreciate it, man.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:58.160
Beautiful. I'm sure we'll come. I'm sure we'll do another one, where we can just like maybe we can

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:02.960
gather a bunch of questions and just have like, I bet we could spend an hour just on q&a, which

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:08.000
could be a cool part to this. So I'll message you guys will chat and see. This has been really

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
beneficial. And I actually learned quite a bit. And I've been trying to piece this stuff together

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.520
for years. So appreciate you guys.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:19.760
Well, it was a zoom call. So I was like, trying to bounce around.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:28.320
It was good. You know, for sure. Well, don't appreciate you encasing up and on. And yeah,

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:34.160
guys, you feel that out. They'll reach out schedule a call and see, you know, what you guys some

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.040
of the next steps you guys can take if you choose to do so. So awesome. Thanks, guys.
