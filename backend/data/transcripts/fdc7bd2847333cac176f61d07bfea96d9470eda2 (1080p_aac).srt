1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,800
Let's just say like, I don't know, let's just say that health rose over and

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,320
they're like, Google becomes allergic to money from agencies and they're like,

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,760
ah, we're not going to accept that shit.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,760
Okay.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,720
Guess what we're going to do?

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,240
We're going to just use a different fricking ad platform.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,240
It, the Google ads is the, is the technique, the strategy is

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,880
results in advance, right?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,040
So like, that's not, that's not the end all be all.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,880
We were, it's just an easy way to feed them leads, but guess what?

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,360
If that goes away, we'll spend our money somewhere else.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,880
You know, we'll figure it out.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,320
So obviously that we don't want that to be the case, but like, I'm never

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,480
going to lose sleep because I'm a problem solver.
