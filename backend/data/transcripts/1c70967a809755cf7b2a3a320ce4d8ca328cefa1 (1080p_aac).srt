1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,200
All right, guys, let's go ahead and get set up for the zoom close.

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,960
So what I do is 20 minutes, 15, 20 minutes before the actual close.

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,200
I come over to my computer, I get my tabs all dialed in in order and that way I'm ready

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
to go.

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,940
So I want everything to be clean so I can just go click, click, click, click, click,

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,940
show them everything.

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,600
And it's just this nice, easy process.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
So what I'm going to have you guys do hop over with me to my screen.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,040
All right, guys, so what I'm looking at here and this we're going to reference this more

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,160
in the next lesson.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,420
But I do want to mention that in the FFM closing script 2.0, I have put the that says zoom

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,420
close prep.

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,840
I like to put my tabs in order.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,720
I'm actually going to move this so that it's right here at the top.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,200
And this is the tabs that I like to pull up.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,800
So I like to have something for my monopoly strategy.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,680
So what I'll do is I'll just have like a window open that says, you know, if I'm doing because

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,160
in this example, I'm using Queen Creek concrete.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,120
So I would like to use either some some other project in Queen Creek, which I could, but

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,680
I think it's more effective to use somebody in concrete.

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,640
So I'm going to use the Bentonville concrete example.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,640
So I've just typed in in Google concrete Bentonville.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,320
OK, now you can be strategic here if you're not ranked for every keyword, you may want

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,880
to go ahead and search for the keyword that you are ranked the best for so you don't look

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,560
like an idiot when you do that.

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
And I've done that before.

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm like, hey, let me go ahead and search this.

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,560
I search it and I'm like, oh, where's my website?

29
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,840
So just, you know, this one, I know for this, I rank for almost anything.

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
So I'm not as worried.

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,720
But if you're only ranked for like five out of 10 terms, make sure to use the ones that

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
you're ranked for.

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
OK, so I have this.

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,760
That's one of the windows I like to have pulled up one of the tabs case studies.

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,040
So you can either use like, and this says case studies slash social proof, so you can

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,880
either have, you know, like we talked about in the screencast, you have text message screenshots

37
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,360
or emails or whatever that say, hey, you know, we've closed this huge deal, whatever.

38
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,880
Or case studies could be your actual website.

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,000
So what I'll probably do is I'll have this website actually pulled up.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
So I'll have another tab with this website pulled up.

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,560
And then the other thing that I do as far as like case studies is I like to show with

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,440
the projects that are really producing leads, I like to show the leads.

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,080
Now, I don't recommend that you show the leads if you're not getting leads or if you're pre-selling,

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
right?

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,560
Or if this is your first project, sorry, not if you're pre-selling, but if this is your

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,280
first project and you don't have another project to say, hey, look how many leads this is getting.

47
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Don't show them.

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,040
OK, only show what you have.

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,180
Does that make sense?

50
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,540
Now, I don't want you guys, this is what you got to be careful of.

51
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,340
I can make this look however I want.

52
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,060
I could get these guys, whoever this is, to believe that I can produce a lot of leads

53
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,260
based on what I'm seeing, what I'm showing here.

54
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,220
I could also get them to believe that I can rank anything based on my rankings.

55
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,580
But what you got to be careful of is you can paint this picture however you want.

56
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,260
But remember, if you oversell, you will deal with it later.

57
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,920
OK, so I'm going to show the leads just to show them the ability, but I'm still going

58
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,060
to pitch them on the 12 to 15 lead range.

59
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,860
I'm not going to have them expecting this.

60
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:20,220
I'm just going to show them the ability that I have to potentially get them this many.

61
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,500
So they know I'm not messing with it.

62
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,900
But some of you guys are going to watch this and go, well, I don't have any leads.

63
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,260
I don't have any sites producing leads.

64
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,260
It's OK.

65
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,460
Just don't show the leads.

66
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,300
Just don't overthink this part.

67
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,740
Last thing I like to pull up is the lead value calculator.

68
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,860
And if you are doing this for your first time, you may want to drop the numbers already in.

69
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:44,900
So 5,000, I like to zero this out, 5,000 being the average ticket price for concrete profit

70
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,900
margin.

71
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,100
I'm going to put it at 20 percent close rate.

72
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,700
I'm going to put it at 30.

73
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:54,460
And then I don't like to show what would you charge per lead because I ain't going to charge

74
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,460
per lead.

75
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,780
OK, so you can zoom in like you could tell.

76
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,220
Even at 100 percent, this is perfect.

77
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,740
It shows just this on my computer, but I like to even zoom in sometimes.

78
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,460
I don't even want them to think there's an option because I've already told them there's

79
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,460
not.

80
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,340
So these are the tabs that I have pulled up.

81
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,460
I get everything ready.

82
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,700
I make sure my audio is working.

83
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,580
I make sure my zoom is ready to go and definitely make sure that you record these calls, make

84
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,940
sure your Wi-Fi is good, get prepped.

85
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,700
And then what I do is for a few minutes right before the call, I get in the zone.

86
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,180
And I know that sounds kind of cheesy, kind of corny, but I literally think about this

87
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,580
and I go, OK, I got a lot of shit on my plate right now.

88
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,580
I got a lot going on.

89
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,580
I'm thinking about a lot of stuff.

90
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,700
I got a family, I got kids.

91
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,700
I got this thing.

92
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,700
I got this problem over here.

93
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:47,300
I got like, for example, right now, like I literally today, I have tax stuff I got to

94
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,300
deal with.

95
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,100
I'm looking at buying a property.

96
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,380
I got to go golf at, not got to, I get to go golf at five.

97
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,260
I got to jump on the phone with somebody for another real estate thing at two.

98
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,180
I got to zoom out like all this stuff.

99
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,360
What I do for the five minutes before the call is I sit and I go, all right, this is

100
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,080
everything that I am doing up to this point.

101
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,880
The leads I'm sending, the list I'm building, the reason you're in this damn program leads

102
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,360
to this moment right here.

103
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,520
And I don't want you to overthink it.

104
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,560
I don't want you to spook yourself out, but I want you to get pretty damn serious about

105
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,760
the fact that this is what matters.

106
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,120
And you performing for the next one hour and doing this correctly and being all in and

107
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,600
not distracted, phone on silent, kids quiet, internet working, this is where I make money.

108
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,080
I do a lot of shit that doesn't make money because I'm not perfect.

109
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,540
But this activity right here is the thing that moves the needle.

110
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,640
The more of this I do, which again, I'm talking to myself right now, like if I'm sitting there

111
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,080
five minutes for I'm like, this is the thing I got to be a 10.

112
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,600
This is the thing that I have to be present for.

113
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,360
This is the thing that I need to do correctly to provide for my family, to hit my goals,

114
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,020
to move that needle.

115
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,600
So get dialed in, turn your damn phone off, quit getting distracted and get locked in

116
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,800
about five minutes before mentally and get ready to go.
