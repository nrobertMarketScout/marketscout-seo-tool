00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
Okay. Beautiful. All right. Let me see if I can see the comments properly. Marcus Dugas.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,520
What's going on, bro? One of our day, not quite day one, but almost day one. What's

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:19,400
up Dev Nate? What's going on? Thad. We're seeing some OGs in here. Stephanie Prather,

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,320
what's going on? Jackson, my friend. What's up? Says he can hear us. Aaron Vogler, Fred

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:37,560
Sommer, Steven Pease, Richard Martes, Bo Hicks. All right. I think we wait just two, three

6
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,160
minutes and then I think we're just going to get into it. But what do you think about

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,800
that? Does it sound good? Let's do it. That works. I also recognize a bunch of these folks.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,800
You can do some OGs in here, man. Yeah, I'm seeing some names. There's Porter, by the

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,800
way. What's up, Porter? He's probably out working on the farm this early morning. Matt

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:07,760
Torres. Guys, this is an exciting day. Yeah, let's just get into it. Let's just get into

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,280
it because I want to spend as much time as possible. We have 53 minutes and I want to

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,520
get as much possible. So guys, welcome to the call. Actually, let me do the everyone

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,480
tag really quick. That's what I'll do. I'm not even going to do any housekeeping. Why

14
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,400
doesn't it not let you do everyone from your computer? Is that the dumbest thing ever?

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,400
Dude, it's so weird. Like I, when I do a good lot of my group, I have to like open the group

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,560
in a different window and then comment in there or do it from my phone. I don't know.

17
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,480
It's like Mark Zuckerberg's figured out how to look like an alien on his own, but he can't

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,240
figure out how to use the everyone tag.

19
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,160
Yeah, or the whole issue. You connect to Zoom, I guess, right? Like the virtual is doing

20
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,600
it natively and why is it so hard to do that?

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,440
It's so hard. Like why are you making it so hard, Zucks? Okay, hold on. Let me see if I

22
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,960
can get it. There we go. Okay. At everyone. Boom. By the way, I had the weirdest dreams,

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,320
dude. David Beckham's son was in my dream. Dude, what a weird dream I had. Oh my goodness.

24
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,760
People were stealing my stuff. So we're, we're trying to get back to reality here now that

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:29,280
I am already go. Okay. Let's see. Brayden Johnson, what's up? Raphael, what's up? Chris

26
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,320
Art, what's up? Emily Fisher, what's up? Okay. We got a crowd. Guys, welcome to the call.

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:40,480
Welcome to the live call. We have Ryan Dalton joining us again. Mr. 80, is it 87 or 86 K?

28
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:52,320
I float between 83 and 87. He's a float. He's a float. I love that. He is our, not basically,

29
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,560
he is our very first student ever to achieve this milestone. He has got a run rate of he's

30
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,040
going to be hitting a, he's, you've already made a million dollars in doing this business,

31
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,600
but now we're at big boy numbers, which is a million dollars per year as our run rate

32
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,800
and it's only climbing. So anyway, congrats to you, bro. Yeah, man. Thanks. Yeah. Homegrown

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,680
in digital landlords and art of reselling. I love it, dude. I love it. So, okay, guys,

34
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,880
here's what we're going to do. Jason already said he's stoked for this. Juan Martinez,

35
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,360
another day one. I'm loving some of these OGs. They're, I think they, they're excited

36
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,400
as well because they've been hobnobbing different stuff together. So here's what we're going

37
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:44,320
to do. We, Ryan has been working on something for about 15 months. Is that about right?

38
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:52,960
Yeah. And I'm going to let him just share five minutes of the story behind it. And then

39
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,320
literally this entire, what I'm going to have him do is share his screen and I'm going to have him

40
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,880
show you guys what he has built and how seamless this is. And then at the end of this call,

41
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,520
we are going to be offering to a certain number of people, we're going to be offering a beta,

42
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:18,320
we're going to be taking on beta students. We've already started doing this with a select few,

43
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,960
but we're going to be taking on some beta students. So at any point, if you, if this

44
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,800
looks interesting to you, stick around to the end, because this would be the time to test this out.

45
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,720
What do we have? Like five people that have just, for a few days, we haven't really had

46
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,400
many issues at all. So when we say beta, basically you're just getting a deal at this point.

47
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,600
Yeah, you're basically getting a deal. I mean, it's not, it's not like, see, beta will sometimes

48
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,800
be used like incomplete, but that's not the case. Like it's very complete. You're, you're just like

49
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,040
one of the first users to know what you think. Now keep in mind, I will say this, I'll say this at

50
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,880
the end too, because we'll, we'll drop a link or whatever for the people that want to do beta.

51
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,840
This is a paid beta. So, you know, that just keep that in mind. This isn't a free base of paid beta

52
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,360
because this is a, something that's taken a lot of time, a lot of money, a lot of effort. Secondly,

53
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,440
because it's beta and there is a discount, expect that there could be a flaw. There could

54
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,400
be something that goes sideways and you have to be patient. That's why the discount is offered.

55
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,760
We don't anticipate there being that much that's weird about it or that goes sideways. However,

56
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,840
keep that in mind. So don't, don't hit up Ryan and say, oh my gosh, this, this little thing

57
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,960
happened. I couldn't log in instantly. Like there's going to be potentially some hiccups. So

58
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,960
that's part of the game. So just you've been warned. Okay. That said, I don't anticipate

59
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:54,400
there being many issues at all. But so Ryan, tell these guys what, what this, like why you built

60
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,560
what you built and guys, I, the title of this stream is what I think is going to describe this

61
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,640
tool as I think it's going to be the only tool you're ever going to need to scale your agency.

62
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,040
And I think the challenging part is going to be trying to figure out what to show them, what not

63
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,000
to show them because we only have 45 minutes. So right. All right. Let's get into it.

64
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,480
Yeah. We'll show them all the, all the fun stuff. It's all fun, but we'll show, we'll show them

65
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,120
good stuff. So, um, all right. So I've been in rank and rant for about two and a half years.

66
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,480
And I got into this and realized pretty quickly that there's not

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,480
a great solutions out there for tools. So we're usually, what happens is this,

68
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,240
as people get into this industry, they're like, Hey, listen, I want to do local lead generation

69
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,640
and they've got to go find a CRM. They got to find the right CRM, right? So their content relation

70
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,040
or their customer relationship manager, they've got to go find a keyword tool. They've got to

71
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,400
go find a site analyzer. They've got to go find programmable voice and messaging. So what happens

72
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,840
is inevitably everyone that does this business model is using three to four, at least different

73
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,440
tools at minimum, uh, that are all like scattered. And the problem with that is,

74
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,760
is the data doesn't talk to each other, right? So this was my frustration is there was not

75
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,680
anything out there. And, and, you know, there are some tools that do more things than others,

76
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,240
right? But there wasn't one that did it all. And so I found myself using a whole bunch of different

77
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,560
tools and having to manually connect that create the connective tissue and places where my data

78
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,680
needs to talk to each other. So, uh, I see we got, uh, Deb Nate on the call. Um, he said he used

79
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:37,120
version 1.0. So version 1.0 was a no-code solution connecting, uh, some of these things together,

80
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,960
where the users basically through like a sort of a mini course could go and connect these using sort

81
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,280
of off the shelf tools. Um, that was, that was great. We've got, you know, a lot of users that

82
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,360
use that, but it also had limitations that have a lot of limitations that I wanted to

83
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,840
make the next version to be a lot better. And so that's what we did. Right. So built, uh,

84
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,440
rank and run engine, uh, as it exists today. And it's got, uh, really everything that you need

85
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,680
to build an agency, no matter what level you're at. Right. So you can have, you know, be a million

86
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,240
dollar run rate, or you could be like at your first day or your first couple of sites or whatever.

87
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,520
And you've got everything you need in-house to grow and build your agency.

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,040
So I know that there wasn't like, besides Dave, uh, Dev, Nate, there was, you had at least a couple

89
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:29,120
hundred people that did this. Yeah, we've had over 300 that used it. And so it was so, it was like

90
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,680
unexpectedly popular. Like it started with just what I was using, like, Hey, this is how I built

91
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,120
my agency. And a buddy of mine, Alex, he, uh, he was like, Hey dude, you should have let other

92
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,800
people try this and see how this works. Cause this works really well. Cause I set it up for him and

93
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,920
worked great for him. And I was like, all right. And so I allowed, you know, really anyone to have

94
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,560
access to it. And a lot of people really liked it, but I also got like consistent feedback. Like

95
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,680
it was more involved to set up phone numbers. People have to set up these, you know, campaigns

96
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,240
and Twilio. And basically I looked at all of the places of version one that people said, Hey,

97
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,720
this part, can we make this better? And then built the version that we have today.

98
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,960
Yep. And like another, another person I know, uh, Mike V used it to scale. Uh, we had Mike V on

99
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,320
a couple of weeks ago. He's just hit $40,000 a month. So,

100
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,080
it was awesome. Uh, but he also set this up for me. It was, it was low cost. It was easy to use.

101
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,560
It was straightforward. And that's what we, we really enjoyed about it. So, um, I gave you co-hosts.

102
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,280
I think what we do is get in there and let's just show the tools that we have today. So,

103
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:43,040
just show the tool and show some of the things that this is going to streamline.

104
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,520
Some of the things it's going to eliminate and just kind of from a, I mean, there's going to be

105
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,320
a ton of stuff that we're not going to be able to get to, but basically, uh, this is going to be

106
00:09:52,320 --> 00:10:00,160
a CRM, a, a search volume, a due diligence, basically all wrapped into one. That's going

107
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,680
to allow you to a project. I mean, everything all wrapped into one. Yeah, that's it. So the,

108
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,320
the goal is for, not the goal, what we did is to make it an all in one platform

109
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,000
to build scale and automates the tagline, right? So you can get it at rankinronengine.com. We'll

110
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,840
talk more about that at the end of the call, but, uh, that was the point is to make it all in one.

111
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,600
And you can read about it here. If you want to see like a super short seven minute demo, um,

112
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,480
I made one for you to just click on this to see, uh, you know, top to bottom, how it all works,

113
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,640
but I'm going to walk you through it and show you guys, uh, we've already got a bunch of people

114
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,000
that are starting to sign up for it. So pretty excited about, uh, about this. So let's start with,

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,240
um, just overview of the platform. I'm going to grab some water. Keep going. Great. Do your thing,

116
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,920
man. Uh, well, I'm just going to give you guys an overview of this platform and I'm going to show

117
00:10:51,920 --> 00:11:00,240
you guys and gals, uh, what the value is for your agencies and why I built this, right? So ultimately

118
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,240
what I found is, is that a lot of people were using all these things in this left column.

119
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,240
There are free tools that were really bad or paid ones that were expensive

120
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,800
or having to use a bunch of paid tools that were expensive. Uh, and it really became like,

121
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,560
I don't know, expensive to, to run, to run an agency. And I noticed this cause I'm big on

122
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,160
running a lean agency and having like the most affordable and high performing way to do every

123
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,000
element of this business model. So, um, I'm going to walk you through this left hand column. Uh,

124
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,840
I think that you guys might be able to, uh, see this. If anyone can't see it, if I need to zoom

125
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,680
in, let me know. I'm going to make it a little bit bigger, but if you guys can't see it, let me know.

126
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,840
So, all right. I'm going to take you through each of these, uh, core features of rake and run engine

127
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,680
and show you how all these work together to build an agency. Right. The first thing is task tracker.

128
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,400
So, um, a lot of people will use things like, uh, Google sheets or notion or, uh,

129
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:08,960
monday.com or Trello, some of these organizational tools, um, that don't tie into the rest of your

130
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:16,640
agency. And so, um, I found that in my agency, I've either created or assigned 3000 tasks

131
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,800
to my team. So either ones that I've done or my team has done, and that has consistently moved

132
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:30,960
the needle forward. So I wanted to integrate that into this platform where you can keep track of

133
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,320
immeasurable, right? Anything in business needs to be measurable. So you're measuring how much

134
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,840
progress that you're making and what needs to be accomplished for your agency and allows you to

135
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,560
scale already with, you know, what's directly in here. So if you want to bring in your team,

136
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,960
you're going to bring in VA's, it's really easy to just, you know, add them as a user to your

137
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,760
company and you can, uh, keep track of that. Right? So there's four categories here. There's

138
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,800
what needs to be done now, what we're working on in progress, what's been done is complete

139
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,080
and what maybe has some kind of blocker, right? This is project management 101 stuff. So, um,

140
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:12,720
I run a, uh, a hundred million dollar project, uh, for, um, the company that I worked for.

141
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,000
And, um, this is based on those principles, right? Project management principles, right? Because

142
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,040
that's what your business is. You're managing your business and you have got to make sure

143
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,800
that you're, uh, tuned into what's most important to move the needle forward.

144
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,120
So I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this part. Uh, it's pretty straightforward,

145
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,600
right? You put in, you know, your task title, right? So to do more bill events,

146
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,840
my keyboard is super loud. So I'm going to try to type a bunch, put in details here about

147
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:45,280
whatever that task is, uh, set priority levels, uh, you know, you can add your labels.

148
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:52,640
So, you know, what's involved to do bill events. Yeah. Uh, that you can add different options down

149
00:13:52,640 --> 00:14:00,000
here, right? So we want to put new bill events and add it. There it is. Add it in, uh, task owner.

150
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,720
You can decide yourself or your team. Uh, so here I'm assigning it to me and then, uh, everything

151
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,680
matters about due dates. So we're going to do this on Halloween. And then you can all color code it

152
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,480
because I'm a nerd like that, right? So when we create this, you can, you know,

153
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,760
add images and all that kind of stuff. It's not, let me click, hold on and make this a little bit

154
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:34,400
smaller. Oh, task details is required. Um, test. Okay. And so you will begin to fill this up with

155
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,200
what's most important for your agency. So you can add images, you can, you know, like tag people,

156
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:47,840
put in comments. This is mission control. So, uh, I have used this extensively in version 1.0 and

157
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:53,120
it's been the, the most, uh, valuable thing for me to go back and measure what kind of results

158
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,640
am I getting and where am I putting my attention? Cause where you put your attention is where you're

159
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,400
going to get your results. All right. And that's what task tracker is about something that's a little

160
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,440
bigger. Real quick. Um, just, I think I might've missed this or maybe you covered it already.

161
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,440
Or if my team, I have a VA or whatever, I can assign this task to them.

162
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,080
Totally. So if I go in here and I click edit right now, I'm the only user in here.

163
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,160
Okay. You can assign people here and you can assign the owner and you as the task right now

164
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:29,040
only shows me, but you could go and you can click on your users and you can add, um, more users in

165
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,560
here. All right. So you want to add more, you want to add your team and, uh, you can add seats

166
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:43,120
basically. Yeah. So again, where you put your attention is where you can measure your results

167
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,480
and that's what task tracker is about. Right. So pretty straightforward project management stuff.

168
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,040
So now we're getting to like the meat of this. This is a due diligence and we covered this, uh,

169
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,600
over the last week. I'm not going to like deep dive into this. Uh, on last week's call, we showed

170
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,520
this Nick, you think like talk a little bit about this, but not going to the level of detail of

171
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,560
last week or you want to go forward? I definitely think we should talk about this and guys, I think,

172
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,800
um, you know, we've been taught for a long time. I mean, months, we, people have been said, you know,

173
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,800
what's the state, like what's, uh, uh, the search volume that gives us confidence to go into what,

174
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,400
what is the minimum search volume? And we've purposely not necessarily said, well, on this

175
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,480
tool, it's this because we haven't, we don't have any control over Semrash or mangles or anything.

176
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,240
Now we do. And so now we're going to be able to go in and over the next month, as we're also,

177
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,600
you know, playing around with it, putting our agencies, uh, completely on this tool,

178
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,960
we're going to be able to come up with a minimum search volume to say, Hey, if the tool says this,

179
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,840
you can, you know, with 90% confidence, be sure there's going to be enough search volumes. I'm

180
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:56,160
really excited about that. But any of you guys that are paying for Semrash and, uh, then you're

181
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,040
paying for that tool and this tool and whatever this right here is going to do everything that

182
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:10,240
you need. If it's just for this feature alone, like I realized I was paying 120 is $129 or $119

183
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,240
for Semrash. I still haven't figured out, is it SCM rush or is it Semrash? I I've gone back and

184
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,680
forth. I don't even know what the proper term is, whatever it is. Only thing I use that tool for

185
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,960
is search volume. Like from the beginning, I've probably spent a hundred bucks a month, I spent

186
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,840
let's just call it a thousand bucks a year, which is less than it is for, I probably spent five to

187
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,960
$10,000 on the search function of Semrash. And that is this one piece of this tool.

188
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,640
What am I going to talk about real quick, or I would cover it a little bit, but tell them how

189
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,640
this data is, it doesn't go through any third parties. It comes directly into this tool.

190
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:58,160
Yeah, absolutely. So, um, you're looking at due diligence records here. So, uh, you know, we'll

191
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,000
dive into this and how we get this data, but I realized that there's such a variance in what

192
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,760
data is out there. At the end of the day, uh, you gotta have the most accurate data to make decisions

193
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,520
about which markets to enter. So this is a due diligence tool that automates this process,

194
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,280
right? Where you will put in the essential information that you need to understand your

195
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,520
market. And then you're going to get it spit back out, you know, what exactly the keyword,

196
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,280
search volume, cost per click, and then your competitor analysis looks like.

197
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,520
So, um, speeds up the due diligence process tremendously. Uh, you can pretty quickly

198
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,000
assess if you've got a good market to go into, um, because it's also going to pull in population.

199
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,400
So, um, I looked at like where this data comes from and what the most accurate data is. So this

200
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,200
is being pulled straight out of a keyword planner where I'm getting it straight from the source.

201
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,680
This is coming straight from Google. And so Google is saying, Hey, this is what the search

202
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,520
volume is. This is what the cost per click is. And if you're not getting, you know, uh, a return,

203
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,240
it's basically Google saying, we don't know. We can't tell you. So one of my frustrations was

204
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,560
some of these other tools like main goals or whatever, um, would give a number for that,

205
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,160
but it was a guess. And when I would run ads, it would be like very wrong.

206
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:25,840
And so, um, having this pulled in with my due diligence into the same records, uh, for competitor

207
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,320
analysis, you know, really allowed me to see what a picture, a snapshot of that market looks

208
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,400
like. Um, so let's do an example. Um, Hey, real quick, Ryan, before we go any further,

209
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,200
just a quick question from Gina. She said, can you add attachments or documents to the task?

210
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:50,640
Yeah, sure can. So, um, you can upload files. Amazing. Yeah. So you can just add,

211
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,040
yeah, um, uh, like a PDF or something like that. You could add to it. That's awesome.

212
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,000
You have images, logos, whatever you'd add. Yeah. Beautiful. And then real quick, one more thing,

213
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,640
just so we're keeping on top of these, Daniel Kelly says, so does rank and rent engine do away

214
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,600
with the need to have multiple subscriptions? Answer is yes. Assuming that he's talking about

215
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,240
having man goals and SEM rush and these things. This is the old guys, the only tool you need to

216
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,840
scale. That's why I call it that live. That's called the live this, but anyway,

217
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,000
I think that's what he's asking. Um, yeah. Absolutely. That's the, that's how we built it.

218
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,240
This is the, this is the definitive tool that you need for this industry, right? So for local lead

219
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,680
generation, you don't need anything else to grow. Now you may have some like, you know, something

220
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,000
that you do with Adobe Photoshop for your editor images or whatever. It didn't have stuff like that,

221
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,120
but like the essentials from local lead generation are here. This is everything you need.

222
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,840
Beautiful. Okay. Sorry to cut you off. I just want to stay on top of that.

223
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:57,120
So, but real quick, I just want to say on this guys, this is this again, the cool part about

224
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,360
this from what everything that I've seen so far is each one of these, like for example,

225
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:08,240
task tracker. I remember at one point in my career, I paid for a program or a software

226
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,480
called pipe drive, right? All pipe drive does is exactly what task track tracker does, which is,

227
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,520
I mean, it does it for your clients or whatever, which we're going to show you that this also does,

228
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,480
but basically you just create these cards and you drag them. That's basically all that it did. And

229
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,360
I was, I think it was like 50 bucks a month. And that's what task trackers now due diligence.

230
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,760
I don't know about you guys, but I was one of those people in the beginning. I had stacks. I

231
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,320
used to print off the due diligence. I would print off like 50 at a time, keep them on my desk.

232
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,720
I'd take a pen and I was writing the information that I had stacks of these

233
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,200
hundreds of these due diligence sheets. And then I thought I graduated and I was so smart and I

234
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,040
went to Google drive. And now I have so many, and I've got, you know, folder inside a folder,

235
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:59,280
inside a folder, inside a folder, inside a folder to get to, you know, and I've got it by niche and

236
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,880
all this different stuff. Whereas this now I can log into my tool. I have my tasks and I have my

237
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,160
search volume and I have my due diligence cards. And I think I asked this last time, is there a

238
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,320
limit to how many of these due diligence you can have?

239
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Yeah. You've got to map out your empire, right? You've got to map out where you're going to put

240
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,280
your, your sites. So it's unlimited. Right.

241
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:28,480
And one other thing I like a lot who here has done the research on, let's say Las Vegas concrete.

242
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,200
It doesn't look good or it does look good or whatever. You decide not to do it. And then like

243
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,400
six months later, you're like, Oh, I should go into Las Vegas concrete or somebody hits you up

244
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,920
and says, you know, you get a referral or whatever. And you're like, I remember doing

245
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,240
the due diligence and you go back and you're like, Oh, I should probably do it again to see

246
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,360
if it's like up to date. Guess what? All you have to do now is push one button.

247
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:59,040
You go to it, you push refetch, correct? And it automatically runs the entire due diligence

248
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,080
right within, what is it? Two and a half seconds, three seconds.

249
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,640
It's pretty much instant. So you can refetch it or you can go in here and here's a, here's one for

250
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,120
Brick Masonry in Nashville. Click edit. If you want to switch out your keywords, right? Like maybe

251
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:18,560
we don't like retaining wall, but we like, you know, brick wall. I don't know. I'm just

252
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,600
going to make up something. And we want to update our keyword because we found that maybe it's

253
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,920
successful in other markets, right? We just go in here and we just update the location and it's

254
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,040
going to refetch that data. So brick wall is a tool. Actually it's not a bad keyword, 140

255
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,960
search volume. I don't know what the cost per click is, but you just edit that record and it

256
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,800
pulls in the latest competitor data as well, right? So their domain age, authority, backlinks,

257
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,680
page authority, citation flow, and trust flow. And it'll refresh all that for you where, you know,

258
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,320
if you're kind of waiting, kind of eyeing it, right? Maybe, you know, your work sure, like your

259
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,880
market was marked to be determined up here. And you're like, all right, I got to look at Masonry

260
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,840
in Nashville. Like, all right, this is pretty good. And you can mark it and go.

261
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,720
Um, let's just do a little math. Let's say you're, how long do you think it takes to do,

262
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,480
take this tool out? Let's say the standard way. How long do you think it takes you to do a due

263
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,040
diligence? I would guess for me, probably about 30 minutes. Yeah, that's probably right. I'll say 30

264
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,440
minutes. Let's say you're average. Let's say you're not making that much money. Your time's worth

265
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,360
$100 an hour, right? So let's say that 50 bucks every time you do one of these, what it costs you.

266
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,800
And let's say that you do, you know, for every area, you have to look at 10. So let's say to do

267
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,480
10 sites, you have to look at 100. So 10 is up by 100. That costs you $5,000 worth of your time

268
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,000
to look at due diligence. You just literally eliminated that with this tool. I mean, it's

269
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,920
insane. It takes you instance three seconds or less to get the same information. It take, it would

270
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:52,160
take you 30 minutes to get. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I mean, money loves speed, right? You said it a

271
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,240
million times. It's true. The faster that you can do this stuff, the more quickly you can make

272
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,520
accurate decisions to go into a market. Not to mention you might miss something because

273
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:09,200
you're human and you, you, you know, incorrectly anyway. So of everything, dude, the search volume

274
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,960
and the due diligence, this might be my favorite part of the entire tool, but piece of it.

275
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,440
Yeah. We spent a lot of time on the due diligence part to really make sure this is

276
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,840
going to grab what you need. I see some of these questions in the chat. So

277
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,800
I'll just talk through, when you add a record, this only works in the US for right now. We're

278
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,360
going to expand to other markets outside the US, but you know, your country is the United States.

279
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,800
You pick your state, you put in your city, you put in your niche, call driven, yes or no. That's

280
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:45,120
just a reminder, like, you know, are we in the right niche? You're putting your primary keywords.

281
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,280
This is your money keyword. Like this is the one, this is masonry, this is artificial grass,

282
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,360
this is concrete contractor, this is fence installation. And then you put up your core

283
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,000
keywords, which are the next six. So those are the ones that you're going to build your service

284
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,720
pages out of when you build service pages. These are, you know, your core keywords and it covers

285
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,360
that and the due diligence modules, right? And then you need to look at how many active

286
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,920
businesses there are. Maybe now you don't know you market TBD and then you put in your top three

287
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:18,320
competitor domains, right? So I just grabbed some URLs here. These are just kind of ones I, you know,

288
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,720
put in and you're going to put in these domains. You can put in an available domain. So this is

289
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,000
grayed out right now because I've already added it. But you'll put, you'll put in this big brick

290
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,280
energy Nashville for a brick mason, but you can, you know, edit whatever your domain is that,

291
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:40,400
you know, you check GoDaddy for to make sure you could buy the domain. Loading fruit, TBD,

292
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,960
go or no go TBD, or maybe you already have a vibe for it and then you update the location,

293
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,600
right? And it's going to pull in that data automatically. So you can see that it just

294
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,680
loaded while we've been talking here, right? So all that data that you normally have to go

295
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,560
type in domain age, like pull up domain authority, like how many backlinks, right? Like

296
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,160
that is completely unnecessary. That's one of the things that frustrate me most is

297
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,960
you just can make it the right API calls to the right services and you're going to get

298
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,360
the data that you need. Yep. Beautiful. So let's just rapid fire through some of these questions

299
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,080
because I know we're going to be just cutting it close here. So real quick, Richard said,

300
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,360
I'm doing my business with my spouse. So can I assign a task to both of us

301
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,760
or can she edit a task without being an admin? Yeah. So there's one company admin. So under users,

302
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:41,200
there's the one admin, you can add someone as a seat on there who is, you know, an administrator,

303
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,520
or you can both use the same account, you know, with the same password. If you want equal admin,

304
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,360
right? So I don't know how you feel about that, but the invited users will appear here. So if you

305
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:58,480
want to add somebody in, you can both be on the task. So this task here, you can assign, you can

306
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,200
have, you know, the owner, you can have the person that's assigned to it and all that is going to

307
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,480
appear just like RRB, right? There's my initials, Ryan Dalton. You would see here on the task who

308
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,600
it belongs to. Beautiful. So it's designed for collaborative, you know, working together, right?

309
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,360
Beautiful. Okay. So answer that one is yes.

310
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,360
Prabh says, just hopping off, can we use this for SEO? Of course you can use this for SEO.

311
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,800
LeadGen is SEO. We're just doing LeadGen. We're just doing SEO for ourselves, right?

312
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,360
Richard says, is it pulling the competitor data on its own without entering that information?

313
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,200
So I think your question is, is it pulling your top three by just virtually knowing what the market

314
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,120
is? And the answer is no, you have to go in and you have to look at what your top three are, right?

315
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,160
Because, you know, you've got to go see what those top three websites are for the ones that you want

316
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,120
to beat. But all you have to do is paste the URL in here. So which is a good thing, by the way,

317
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,440
because if not, maybe it would pull in like a home advisor and stuff like that. And we all know that

318
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,760
home advisor, even though they may be your spot number one, they're not the same type of a

319
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,360
competition as a local competitor, because Google likes to give the spot to the local. So yeah,

320
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,280
you're going to go in, you're going to just choose those three, the ones that you keep seeing over

321
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,840
and over, and boom, then you're going to have that information. So it's going to take you just a

322
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,240
second. Bo asks the same question, how is it picking the top three competitors? So that's one,

323
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,880
you're going to put in the top three competitors. Again, we can't, unless we had a formula that said,

324
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,880
get rid of home advisor, do this, do this. There's no way that we could do that, because it would

325
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,080
just be pulling the top three. And sometimes that would be the home advisor or Angie's list, which

326
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,240
in which case it wouldn't be accurate. So that you do put in the top three competitors.

327
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,560
Yeah. Yeah. There's limits to good software and automation. Like the best way to do it is to have

328
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:55,200
a human in the loop, right? You want to have a human that is looking at that data and saying like,

329
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,040
yeah, these are the top three, you plug those in and then everything else is done automatically

330
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,160
for you after that. Okay. Beautiful. I agree. Gina says, I have stuff scattered everywhere.

331
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:09,440
This is amazing. I a hundred percent agree with you. And then Bruce has said to this DD tool,

332
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,040
find your top competitors. Well, no, that's, we covered that as well. Okay. Last one, Daniel

333
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,200
Kelly says, not related to ranking or Angie, but would appreciate some input on choosing a niche.

334
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,720
I joined last week. I spent a while looking at a tree service, but it seems almost impossible to

335
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,720
rank for an ultra competitive. So I'd appreciate some ones Nick would recommend. Okay. I'll comment

336
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,840
with some of the recommended ones. So we don't have to stop on that one. Daniel, just give me a

337
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:37,840
second. I'll respond there. And then Kirk says, perhaps it could screen out. Yeah, it could. But

338
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,080
again, as Ryan said, I think having a human in the loop is the best option, but it's not something

339
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,200
that we can't update going forward. And then Raphael says, do I still need to use Google

340
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:53,440
keyword planner for ads? No, you don't. So we can jump around here. We don't have to go in order.

341
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,280
Uh, so I'm sure you keyword planner. So here's keyword planner. Uh, we're just going to do old

342
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,920
faithful. Let's do concrete. It's a contractor. By the way, let me point something out quick,

343
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,480
quick, quick. Um, everyone thinks concrete saturated literally yesterday when I was on

344
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,640
the call, uh, with, I was going to call it Jason. He had to hop off. Jason already had to hop off,

345
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,680
get on a closing call. He got on like 15 minutes later, 30 minutes later, and he closed a $1,400

346
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,160
a month deal in concrete. There are deals out there. I'm not saying that you should go into

347
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:28,400
concrete, but if you look hard enough, there's still deals. So, um, yeah, use old faithful for

348
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,520
us. Yeah, we, we can, we can switch up. We do, uh, we'll do Mason. Let's do a fresh one. Right. So,

349
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,960
um, I still get deals in concrete. Uh, we're we'll have a closing call this week for concrete. So,

350
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,400
uh, I don't think it's, well, let's, let's do another one. Let's do, uh, let's do Mason. Right.

351
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:48,640
So this data is your keyword planner, right? So think about how much time is lost hopping

352
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,640
between all these platforms. You're not only paying for them, but you're jumping between them

353
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:59,520
back and forth and it's, it's slowing you down. So, um, this is something that I felt very acutely.

354
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,720
I don't want to have to always be jumping back and forth. You also have data fidelity issues when

355
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,160
that happens, right? Like, am I making sure that I'm putting the right data in? Is my team putting

356
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:15,280
the right data in? This is pulling straight from the source. This is pure keyword and, uh,

357
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,600
calls per click and search volume data. So, uh, we did Masonry, Nashville area, search volume,

358
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:28,720
calls per click. You can see the PPC competition level, right? So, um, the, you know, low, uh,

359
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,400
and then the competition is just shown here as low, right? So, um, it also pulls your low, uh,

360
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,840
top of page bid and your high top of page bid to see what it's going to cost you to get at the top

361
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,360
of the page. Uh, and then you're obviously your average monthly search volume, uh, over the course

362
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:52,560
of the last year. And then related keywords, right? So all the Mesa Green near me, um, if it

363
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,200
doesn't have the data for that, it's not going to make up a number. This, again, this is what

364
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,440
frustrated me about some of these other tools is it will make up a number based on, you know,

365
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,600
whatever data brokers are pulling from, because that's what these keyword planners do is they go

366
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:12,800
buy data from, from places. And, um, I found this to be pretty unreliable. I want as accurate as I

367
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,640
can get. And if Google doesn't know, like, I need to know that, right? So, uh, this is a great

368
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,200
example of the, like, you know, you put in that core keyword, this is my primary keyword and,

369
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,400
you know, I'm going to get that, that search data to pull up. Beautiful. So I'm just looking at

370
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,600
comments. Uh, Mike V is a tool limited to the United States. Obviously not all the features,

371
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:41,200
but some of the, uh, the competitor analysis features, that kind of stuff. Um, of course that,

372
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:48,640
that's, this is just beta. So we're going to be working on that, but yes, it is. Um, Aaron Smith

373
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,920
said, I joined a bit late. How do we access this tool? We're going to be getting to that here in

374
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:57,840
just a moment in the next 15 minutes. So hold on one second on that. And Richard said, is there

375
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,280
a way to save previous keyword planner searches? Oh, that's a great idea. Yeah. So I've been talking

376
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,600
to the developers about that. What we'd like to do is have a keyword search history where you can

377
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,520
just select if you want to go back and look at that, that doesn't exist now, but you guys,

378
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,720
this community drives the development of this tool. This is made by people doing rank and rent

379
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,320
for people doing rank and rent. So, you know, as you guys are using this tool, I've got a,

380
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,760
you know, up here in this corner, I've got a support button that you can click and you can say,

381
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,240
hey, I've got this idea. Hey, why don't we do this? I'm going to take what the,

382
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,200
what the people want and build it. Right. So things like that, that we continually,

383
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,320
we'll make this the best in class tool for this industry. And, uh, you know, you guys are,

384
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,120
are the ones that are informing that. Beautiful. What else should we cover? We have time to cover

385
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:54,080
like, what else do you want to cover, man? We have programmable. So I want to talk about the

386
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,560
biggest thing that you need for retention in this industry. And so let me tell you in 30 seconds,

387
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,400
how I know this. I will also, in my agency, close sites for site owners. And one of the things that

388
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,800
I coach the site owners who bring sites to me, they want to get them closed and on a profit

389
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,480
split. Basically I'll say, Hey, you need to have a text message SMS notification set up in your

390
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,080
programmable voice so that the business owner knows that you're getting those leads over to them,

391
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,760
right? Where every time a call comes in, they get a text message that says you have a new

392
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,440
lead from, and it shows the number. So what I've done is, um, when you guys get a number here,

393
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,640
your first ones are included for free with your subscription. This has a full suite of programmable

394
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,120
voice and messaging. So you can go in here and you can, you know, pull up this number and this

395
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,720
one is for a little rock concrete, right? That exists. It's not a real site. I'm sure it's a

396
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,680
real site for someone under that domain, but I just put some information in here. Um, and so you

397
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,800
could put in your, you know, all this information in here, right? So you can put in your tracking

398
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,480
number. You're, um, uh, pulled in automatically. You can put in your forwarding number and then

399
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,160
down here, all of this stuff right here is about retention. So, um, when the call comes in, you

400
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,600
want to be able to enable spam filtering or not. So one of the key complaints that business owners

401
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,560
give is about spam. And they're like, Hey, I get great leads, but I've got this spam coming in.

402
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,320
All you got to do is enable spam filtering. And now when someone calls, they press, uh, one to

403
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,160
connect to the business owner, right? They hear a message that says something like, um, press,

404
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,560
thank you for calling, uh, press one to be connected to one of our team. And the call will

405
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,400
actually not go through until someone presses that input. So it saves you with one click, uh,

406
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,640
spam concerns from your business owners. Um, you can choose your whisper message, male or female.

407
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,840
It's also got state law compliance for call recordings. So, uh, you can click this right

408
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,080
here to play it and listen to it if you want to. But basically it's just that message that says

409
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,600
this call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance or training purposes, which is,

410
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,400
um, required by state law. If you do two party, uh, call recordings or one party call recording

411
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,800
or other, right? So not true for every state, but it's true in a lot of states. And so I just leave

412
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,760
it on by default to be compliant. Um, and then you can put in your whisper messages here, right? So

413
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,320
you can do, uh, there's a default one that says, Hey, you have a new call generated from Little Rock

414
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,520
Concrete, or you can do a custom one. If you want to like, Hey, Nick, uh, you have a call from

415
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,320
Little Rock Concrete, like put in my business owner's name there. Uh, do you ask, does this

416
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,760
take place a call rail? Yes. You can put in, uh, you, your numbers that exist now already,

417
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,480
if you want to, or excuse me, or you can, uh, get new numbers through program of voice SMS.

418
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:48,160
So let's say I have a call rail account. What I is there's a way to like bring all my numbers in and

419
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,320
then get rid of my call rail account. Yeah. So we're going to do a number of, uh, porting, uh,

420
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,720
in the future, right? We don't have porting set up, but what you can do is you can keep that number

421
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,440
there. You don't have to buy numbers here. Uh, your numbers are included with your subscription

422
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,160
up to a certain amount. Um, and then, uh, you can just add in your numbers here into your

423
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,920
sites, into your site portfolio, right? Where you just type in what the number is instead of

424
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,640
add a new one. So you keep that for now, your existing sites, you'd keep your call rail account

425
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,280
and keep those numbers and, uh, and then you're, but going forward, new numbers,

426
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,400
you could buy directly through this, through Twilio. And then once we, uh, add porting as

427
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,960
part of, as one of the new features, then, um, you can go ahead and, and we could get rid of that.

428
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,440
Absolutely. Yep. Yep. Um, and the cool thing about these numbers is on the backend,

429
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,760
they have got a feature that I love is that you can do, if you do Google business profile

430
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,120
verifications, you can do those through, uh, these numbers, through, uh, the call,

431
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:53,280
whereas call rail blocks that. It doesn't let you do it. So, uh, pretty neat little, um, difference

432
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,880
there. Here's the real moneymaker for me. I would not even do local lead generation if not for what

433
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,720
I'm about to show you guys. Like I would not do it. It would be too frustrating for me.

434
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,880
And that is SMS notifications. So, um, when the call comes in by default, this is enabled.

435
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,880
It's going to show you have a new lead from, and then it shows the site name automatically

436
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,680
pulled in and then the caller's number. And so that business owner, every time they get a call,

437
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,280
uh, it says you have a new lead from, and it shows that, that phone number. And so it keeps you

438
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,720
top of their mind. They are thinking like, okay, I'm getting these leads. They're still coming in.

439
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,360
We've already blocked out the spam because we turned on spam filtering and they're getting

440
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:39,360
this text message. And every time that they get that new lead coming in, they're seeing the value

441
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,240
of your service. So this has been like the number one most valuable thing for me in my agency.

442
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,040
I've baked it into a rank and run engine. So just from the jump, you've got access to it.

443
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:57,040
I love that. That's it's so valuable because it, um, you like, even if you, even if it's only 10

444
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,720
leads or 15 leads or whatever, just constantly reminding them, you know, that you're there,

445
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,640
Hey, you know, it's like, you're poking them and say, Hey dude, that's me. That's me. That's me.

446
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,240
Cause a lot of times these business owners, even though it's coming from you, they want to assume

447
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,840
it's from their own stupid little go daddy site. And, and they would do everything to be like,

448
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,480
Oh, I don't think so. I don't think so. Right. This is going to show them that like, this does,

449
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,440
this does indeed come from you. So this is a great retention tool. And for those of us that

450
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,720
have done nothing for retention and still retained people, imagine this is just going to be one more,

451
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:39,280
you know, a nail in the coffin to keep these people just locked in with us. So, um, and by

452
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,040
the way, uh, did you enable that or is that default? By default, they have this, you could

453
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:51,040
customize it and change it, right. You put in, you know, a name or whatever, right. But by default,

454
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,360
they get an SMS lead notification. I could see really buttering up the business owner and be

455
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:02,080
like, hello, boss. Uh, here's a little call. Yeah. Something like that. Anyway. Yeah, man.

456
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,760
Yeah. So, uh, you get all your tracking numbers in here. You can get a new one straight through

457
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,920
the platform, right? So, you know, if you want to get, you know, your, your new tracking number,

458
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,240
you can get it, configure it just like I showed you guys a second ago. Right now it's just the

459
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,080
U S my idea. Love you, man. Sorry. It's not there for New Zealand yet, but we'll get you hooked up.

460
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,520
Um, and then you'll, uh, be able to get those numbers, but, uh, right now it's just the U S

461
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,640
but it's, it's, you know, it's everywhere in the U S so, uh, you can get those numbers and you can

462
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,800
see your first ones are included for free on your account. Beautiful. How many, how many are included

463
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:46,080
for free? Uh, your first five on your, if you do ignition, if you do full throttle, sorry, ignition,

464
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:51,040
it's five turbo charges, 20 in full throttle. It's 50. Those are the three different levels.

465
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,680
Okay. Beautiful. And then you can, you can add your own, uh, as well, right? So you can do add

466
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:05,040
on numbers, uh, very affordably. So, uh, let's co can we cover one more, one more, uh, feature

467
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,920
and then we can do a few questions and we can, uh, let anyone, we can share the beta information

468
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,840
that want the people that want to, uh, get on the beta for a discount.

469
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,640
For sure. Yeah. So, uh, we're going to cover this last one here, but, you know,

470
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,560
I'm just going to run through these. You can do site portfolio. All your sites are in one spot,

471
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,160
uh, put in all your sites, prospects, put in all your prospects, clients, all your clients show

472
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,800
up here, right? You can put in the service type SEO lead generation paid advertising,

473
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,320
your subscription type, et cetera, uh, put in all your leads. You can check all your leads here,

474
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,560
and then you can see all your calls and the recordings. But the one I'll show you guys is

475
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:52,560
this one. Uh, this is site analyzer. So this will allow you to go in and look at the performance of

476
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,160
your own sites or look at your competition sites. So I put in, you know, one of my Legion sites here

477
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,320
and, you know, you can see all the essential metrics at these cards, the top citation flow,

478
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,560
trust flow, domain authority, page authority. Are you improving at these metrics over time

479
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,440
to outrank your competition? Um, you can see your backlink profile, right? Like how many are you

480
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:18,560
gaining the last 12 months? Uh, how many of you gained a loss over the last 12 months, right? Uh,

481
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,720
here, this gets a little bit technical. I'll probably don't have time for all this, but

482
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,080
gets into your referring IPs, your referring subnet nets and your external backlinks, and then, uh,

483
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:34,000
your top referring domains, which you want some diversity on. So, uh, referring domains, uh,

484
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,760
all times showing all the, the top ones where you're getting backlinks from basically and what,

485
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,880
their trust flow and citation flow looks like. And then your anchor texts, right? Like how much

486
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,360
anchor text diversity do you have and, uh, what kind of referring domains, all the essential

487
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,720
information that you need that will give you an insight into the performance of your own

488
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,920
lead generation site. And, you know, you can put in competitors too, right? So you can do your own

489
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,240
or you can do another one, but, um, all that data gets piped into this, this one, uh, dashboard for

490
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,920
you. Is it safe? You analyze it and then does it just read, when you put the new one, it doesn't

491
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,960
get rid of this. Is it just like a standing tool or does it save past searches? Yeah, it'll put

492
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:24,560
a new one in. So let's do, uh, oh, I didn't do that commonplace. Um, this is for like, uh,

493
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,560
assessing a site at a time. If you want to do a due diligence record, you could pull that in

494
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:34,000
for due diligence, right? So if I go back, it's just gonna, it's gonna refresh it. Um, but we'll

495
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,520
add a, um, search history, like, uh, you know, here's the ones that you've done, the results

496
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,400
that they got. So we'll add that in the future. Yeah. Beautiful. Okay. I think that's something

497
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:52,720
we should add. I think it'd be nice. Concrete. One thing I want to mention guys is you can finish,

498
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:59,920
you can finish this. Let me, so each one of these tabs is basically replacing a software tool,

499
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,560
right? Like that's how, like I was just looking at it. Task tracker. Um, we, I mean, we've used all

500
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:12,640
kinds of different stuff. I told you, we used to use, uh, like, what's this? There's notion,

501
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:19,200
right? We use notion for task tracker, then the due diligence. We used Google sheets and we used

502
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,920
SEMrush and then the site portfolio. We would use, uh, we used everything from Asana

503
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:33,360
to Google sheets to pipe. Like I don't know what else we use. We said that was prospect pipeline.

504
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:41,760
I used pipe drive client list. We use Entraport, like lead tracker, call rail. It's like every

505
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,160
single one of these I was paying or using a different tool. Even if I wasn't paying,

506
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,520
I had to go and toggle between all these tabs. And now each one of these little tabs on the

507
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,760
left here is replacing a piece of software, putting it into one place that you can just,

508
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,120
you know, scale your entire agency from, which is incredible. Money loves speed.

509
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,240
That's the goal, man. Put it all in one spot. It doesn't need to be in 10 different places.

510
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,720
It just creates inefficiencies. Here's the most important part. Can I put my own profile picture

511
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:17,840
in the corner? For somebody like me, that's real. You can put it in the goofy avatars, right?

512
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,560
Okay. But you can actually upload a picture. Yeah, you can upload your picture.

513
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,160
Amazing. Obviously guys, that's not the most important thing, but I thought it's kind of a

514
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,280
nice little touch. Okay. So let me look at this really quick. We have a few minutes. I'm super

515
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:38,240
pumped to get my team in playing with it, me getting in playing with it.

516
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,880
Let's just do a couple of questions. Then we're going to share the information on the beta. Okay.

517
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:53,840
So let's see. Man, we got so many questions. Let me start at the bottom, actually.

518
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,120
Jahil says, I joined late, but I have a question about the site portfolio section. Is there some

519
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:02,560
type of filtering system where we can split sites we have rented from the sites we don't have rented?

520
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:11,200
Yeah, for sure. So you could show ones that are in development, right? And those are basically

521
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,960
unlimited, right? You could put just tons of in-development ones in there. And then when

522
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:22,320
the development status is complete, you could put a market is complete and then edit whatever

523
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,720
details you need to in here, right? So you can do your service type by lead generation, SEO,

524
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,040
paid advertising, whatever your site is, and then indicate whether you actually have a client on it.

525
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,680
So under your client list, you can tie it to a website, right? So that website will be assigned

526
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:42,320
to a client and then they'll know if it's rented. Beautiful. Okay. Jeremy says, hey Ryan, congrats

527
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,480
on building such a promising tool. It looks really great. Sorry if they've already been asked. I'm on

528
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,920
the job. So you got a couple of questions. Let's rapid fire. And I know some of the answers,

529
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:56,480
so I'll answer them. Can we bring in our own Twilio numbers, bring your own key style or

530
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,120
must we purchase them in rare? They'll eventually be able to be ported in. In the meantime,

531
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,720
what you can do is you can, when you create a site, you can just put in the phone number,

532
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,200
the number you like to tracking number, or you can just add your own.

533
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,160
Perfect. Number two, he says, if not, can we pour our tracking numbers in out of rare?

534
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,920
Not yet, but that is, that has been asked a couple of times. So that's going to be at the top of what

535
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:24,400
we want to, we want to update the next update. Okay. Does it have a web browser dialer in it

536
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,360
so we can call the leads via the website tracking number? I don't think so right now.

537
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,200
No. Okay. And again, guys, as it's crazy, because as you guys are asking these questions, it's,

538
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:44,800
it would be really impossible to cover like from, remember this is version like, you know, 1.0,

539
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,800
it's a version 2.0 of rare, but this is version 1.0 of this being an actual tool. And I think

540
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,200
you've covered basically everything. So of course, there's going to be these little teeny

541
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,440
things that are nice, whatever, but just keep in mind, there are going to be a lot of updates

542
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,320
coming. This is just where we're starting at. Okay. One more question. He asks, he said, I see

543
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,520
on your website, it says you only support USA number at this time. Do you have an estimated

544
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,880
timeline for Canada and other countries? I don't know if we have a timeline, but of course,

545
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:19,120
by popular demand, it's probably the order that we'll tackle. It'll probably be Canada slash

546
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:24,240
Australia would be the second one. And then of course, Mike V, we got to hook up Mike V. He's

547
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,600
over there just carrying the whole country on his back over there in New Zealand. New Zealand love.

548
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:37,040
Yes. Okay. And then let's keep just a couple more and then we're going to have to go through

549
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,400
and just answer these. Bruce says, one last question. Will you be doing a bit further

550
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,040
training inside of the rare Facebook group? Yeah. So I made a ranking or an engine Facebook group.

551
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,200
We can share that here, basically for this community, people using this platform. So if you

552
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,920
guys want to join that, just search ranking or an engine and jump in. There's not much there right

553
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:04,640
now, but I intend to share more trainings and more product roadmap and things like that. So you guys

554
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,280
are constantly getting the latest from me in there as well. Let's answer one more question and we'll

555
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,040
get into beta stuff. Luke Hill, and I think this is important, he says, so why wouldn't Google give

556
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,840
that on Google Keyword Planner or why wouldn't other tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush use the same

557
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:23,600
API? Why do you think that is? Because we're talking about how this data isn't going to third

558
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:29,520
parties. Why do you think they're not using that? Good question. I can't speak for why other

559
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:35,360
platforms were built the way that they were. Every keyword tool has its little nuances,

560
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:42,160
has its differences, right? For our industry, we are very focused on the local search volume,

561
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:48,800
the local keywords. There's nothing built for that. It's like, what is the fastest path to

562
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,600
knowing in that local market what that search volume is, what that cost per click is, right?

563
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:59,760
So I chose like, hey, the gold standard for this after running, you know, I've ran probably $300,

564
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:06,960
$400,000 of ads now is going to come from Google, right? That is the place to get the gold standard

565
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,600
of information and data for me. And so I wanted to tie that in, right? I can't speak to some of

566
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,440
these other choices for the way they build theirs. They're catering off into much bigger

567
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,760
corporations, right? Like how many people are searching for sneakers by Nike, right? You know,

568
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,960
that's not what we're doing. And so I built our tool bespoke for our use case.

569
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,600
Which I think is super interesting because a lot of people with tools, they want to, they're like

570
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,400
thinking, well, I want to, I want to build this tool so that we can get people in this industry,

571
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,120
in this industry, in this industry want to make. And of course, this is a moneymaking product.

572
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:45,600
Ryan's isn't just a charity. However, Ryan makes his money from doing rank and rent. And so this is

573
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,320
not only, of course, it's a way to make money, but it's also a way to scale his rank and rent

574
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:55,120
agency even further. And so I think the best products, the best tools always come from people

575
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:59,360
inside that industry because they know the pain points. Whereas somebody from the outside coming

576
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,840
in to build it just to make money, it's never going to cater exactly because they don't know

577
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:08,800
those pains. So anyway, let's, we only have a couple of minutes, right? How do people,

578
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:15,680
and I'm going to try it. We'll try our best maybe to either do like a Q and a session later,

579
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,560
or just go in and answer these questions. But how do people, if they want to get on the beta

580
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,840
discount, how do they sign up? And what does that look like price wise, et cetera? We have 38 people

581
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,320
on, let's show them that really quick. Give them the link and let them go start playing around with

582
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:37,040
this amazing tool. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. Nick hooked it up. You guys are getting early access.

583
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:43,440
So you go to rentandrentengine.com. You can click create a free account. And then for the first 50

584
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:52,720
people that use Ignition 24, so all capitals, no spaces, Ignition 24, one word, will get 20%

585
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,600
off. So the first tier is 97 bucks a month. You can cancel your main goals. You can cancel your

586
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:02,160
SEM rush, right? Like you're going to go in here and see that, you know, this is very much a cost

587
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:10,000
savings tool for you guys. And you're getting 20% off on top of that. What's the code? Ignition 24.

588
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:19,040
That's the first two months at 20% off. So IGNITION24. We can put it in the, in the chat

589
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:25,520
or 24, all lowercase, all uppercase. So you know, it's case sensitive, but I just put it in.

590
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:33,840
Oh, I misspelled it. Time too fast. I don't delete that comment. All right. Ignition 24,

591
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,520
like starting a car night. Beautiful.

592
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:46,480
Also real quick, Daniel Kelly. Okay, good. I spelled it correctly too. Okay. Daniel Kelly,

593
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:52,560
go look at your previous comment. I dropped the recommended niches for you specifically. I

594
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,560
spent some time to write that comment out. So guys, if you are interested

595
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:02,480
on a 20% discount for the first, I think it's 50 people is what it's capped at. What we're,

596
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,720
and by the way, this is coming to you guys first. We haven't taken this to the free group. We haven't

597
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,120
taken this to, you know, whatever. We're going to be doing an official, official, official, official

598
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:20,000
launch next, probably in about a month, depending on how this beta test goes. Could be as early as

599
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:30,560
two weeks, but most likely first of November. But yeah, go in, play with this and just know that

600
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,720
you guys are, you guys are our people. We're excited. We want to get as much feedback as

601
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,400
possible. If people have feedback, where would be the best place? Should they go in the Facebook

602
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,800
group and drop a comment? Because I don't want to make a huge mess here, like DMing you and stuff

603
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,840
like that. Where should they go for support? Should they go to the Facebook group and drop a

604
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,760
question, comment? Like what would be the quickest way to give feedback?

605
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,520
Yeah. If they want, it's only positive things that I accept. No, I'm just kidding. If you want to go

606
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,760
to ask feedback, you could talk about it in the Facebook group, but if you want it the

607
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:08,880
most direct and organized way that I'm categorizing this stuff is when you create an account in this

608
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,680
top corner, you'll get your user profile information, click on support. It's going to pull up this form.

609
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:25,840
And so this form is going to be refreshed. Here we go. It's your rare user support request form.

610
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,960
So you put in anything that you see in here, hit submit. It's a super short form. It'll go straight

611
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,800
to me, into my email. And so I can see anything going on. And you're also free to DM me as well.

612
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:42,080
Just find me on Facebook and send me a DM. If you guys would though, I mean, for the benefit

613
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:46,800
of the community, if you could do that form, it would make it easier for Ryan to address

614
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:52,880
these things and also update. So I know sometimes you get frustrated when a fire off a message

615
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,560
and, you know, whatever, but if you guys will do that, maybe you do both. If you're really,

616
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:04,160
it's a really quick thing you want to get answered, but this is going to allow Ryan to continue to

617
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:10,160
make this tool even better and better. Okay. So one more time. Okay. Shane real quick says,

618
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,160
awesome. Can you increase your package at any time? Sure can. Yep. You can also do add on sites. So

619
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,520
if you've got 10 sites, you can do add on sites as well without having to upgrade your package.

620
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:26,800
Or you can, you know, choose the highest tier if you want to. Right. So anytime that's available

621
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:32,080
for you guys. And then Jahil has a good question. He said, how does the search volume, how does the

622
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:37,440
search volume do when searching for Metmo? That's exactly, well, guys, this tool, as of last week,

623
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,440
right when we went live, that was like when we started basically being able to play with it as

624
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,920
well. So that's one of the things that I'm going to be looking at in the next few weeks

625
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,640
is when we type in a Bentonville concrete, when you type in that, that key site, what is that minimum

626
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,920
search volume? So, uh, stay just a little bit patient with me as we figure that out. I don't

627
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:03,040
want to come out and say, Oh, when it says this, you know, then that's a, uh, for sure, because I'm

628
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,080
not a hundred percent there yet, but this is now I'm confident because we have control over the tool

629
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:13,920
that we can give you that with a 90% confidence rating type of thing. So, um, again, guys,

630
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:21,120
if you are interested in the beta, go to rankandrentengine.com and choose your package.

631
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,960
And then the ignition all caps, we think ignition 24, maybe not case sensitive. I don't know to get

632
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:34,160
20% off, uh, for the first, how many months? Two months, first two months. And then one more thing,

633
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:42,800
Matt says, could an overseas VA team call using the tracking numbers? Uh, there's not anything to

634
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:51,440
have, uh, those dial out right now. Um, but I've got some ideas for that. So stay tuned. Beautiful,

635
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:58,400
beautiful. Okay. I think we, I mean, I think that's pretty much it guys. Um, go test it out,

636
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:06,480
play with it. Uh, if you guys are like the lowest package is 99 bucks, 97, you get a 20% discount.

637
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:13,600
We're at, let's call it 80 bucks, 80 bucks a month. SEM rush is 129 a month, just for the search

638
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:19,120
volume. Like it's at the lowest package, it's, it's a no brainer, especially with the, with the

639
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:27,920
discount. Okay. Um, you can use it for SEP. Okay. Anyway, um, Kirk says just registered,

640
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,280
but it's us only, do we lose out on the offer? Any idea on the UK feature?

641
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:39,200
Uh, so let's see, just registered. That's right. Yep. So it's, it's still just us only, right? So,

642
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:44,720
um, if you're, if you're in the UK or Canada, Australia, like we've heard you guys, you know,

643
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,080
we want to keep building this out for you guys. We're starting with the U S and then we're going

644
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:52,960
to expand it out from there. Um, Kurt messaged me when, when that time comes, we'll do something

645
00:58:52,960 --> 00:59:01,840
special for every guy and, uh, gal in the UK. Um, one thing on, uh, dial outs, there are third

646
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:08,960
party programs that you can use like talking to that you can actually plug in your, uh, SEP

647
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:15,760
and SID. Oops. Um, this SID, I haven't tested that with this yet. Um, but you guys might be able to,

648
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,560
do it that way, right? So, um, that's, that's a possibility in any case, in the future,

649
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,960
we'll be able to make it to where you guys can use your numbers for dialing out using tools,

650
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,120
um, either natively built in or third party, but, um, that doesn't exist right now.

651
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:35,520
Beautiful. Ryan Dalton, you've done, you've done miracles, my friend. I'm excited to, uh,

652
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:42,800
get in play with this myself, get our entire agency over here. And, uh, yeah, anybody else guys,

653
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:48,160
again, Marcus just shared it one more time. Ignition 24, go to rankinventag.com sign up for

654
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:53,680
the package and let's, let's, let's go, let's go test this thing out. Let's go and give Ryan

655
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:59,440
as much feedback as possible and, and start, um, building our agencies on this. Yeah, man,

656
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,960
go build scale and automate. Let's do it. Thanks, Ryan. See you.
