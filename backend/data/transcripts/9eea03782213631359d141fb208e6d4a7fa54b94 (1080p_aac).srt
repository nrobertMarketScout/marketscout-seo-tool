1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,280
I love talking business. I love helping people make money because it helps me make money.

2
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,680
Okay. I'm not the philanthropist. I'm not the guy that's going to say I like to help people.

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,240
I like to help people make money because that's how I make money. So let's just clear that out of

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,200
the way. But what I want to share with you really quickly to give you a little bit of confidence

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,000
that you did make the right decision and I do want to thank you and tell you right now

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,960
that I will make sure that you get far more value than you will ever spend with me. That is my

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,520
commitment to you because I know how this works. I know that I need to help you get deals. You're

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,840
here for one reason and that is to make money. You are here to get deals and if I can help you

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,080
get deals, I'm therefore going to make money. Okay. But I want to give you a little bit of

10
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,200
confidence and say this does work and I'm not talking about the case studies, which is social

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,920
proof. I want to just tell you how this came to be really quickly. This is not something that a

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,760
couple of months ago I sat down and went, you know what? There's a huge opportunity to make money

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,880
and I'm going to develop this system and I'm going to sell it. No, what happened was in 2019,

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,720
as you guys may or may not know, I was $60,000 in debt. I had two cars. I lived in a different

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,600
house. I had a house payment. I had three kids and I had a really upset wife who didn't even

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,200
know about that debt. I sat down and I looked at my situation and I looked at my goals and I was

17
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,040
like, I want to make $100,000 a month. I can't do this. I can't work for somebody else. I have to

18
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,520
own the thing. I have to own the business. I had been doing some version of a digital agency for

19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,000
years and years and years and I couldn't scale. What this is, what you're about to watch, what

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,360
Flat Fee Mastery is, is it is the product of how I was able to go from a situation that was very

21
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,840
dire to doing seven figures in a 12-month period. That is what this is. This is something that came,

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,080
this was the solution to my problems. This is the solution to how do I scale up and hit the

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,040
$100,000 per month goal that I had set for myself and that is how this came. I want to make sure

24
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,400
that you understand this did not come as a way to make money. This came because I needed to get

25
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,960
out of that really terrible situation and I figured out this thing called results in advance

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,040
and this thing called running ads to a landing page and all these different little pieces of

27
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,560
the puzzle and I started testing and I started tweaking and I started refining and I developed

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,400
this process. I just want you to know that the reason that I can assure you that this works is

29
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,920
yeah forget about the case studies, forget about all the people that I've already shown

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,520
you that have tried this and made this work but this is exactly what I used to get out of my

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:03,200
situation that was the catalyst to get me to where I am today. I believe the best products are those

32
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,480
that were made as solutions. There were those that were made to solve problems, not the ones

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,080
that were created, not products that were created just to make money and I'll tell you

34
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,880
that this what you're about to jump into, what you're about to see, what you're about to go

35
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,360
through was the solution that I came up with to my problems.
