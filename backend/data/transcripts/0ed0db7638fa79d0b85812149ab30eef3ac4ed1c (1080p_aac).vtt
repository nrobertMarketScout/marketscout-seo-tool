Guys, welcome to module four and we're going to talk about the finish work.

00:09.160 --> 00:13.880
We're going to talk about on page SEO and we're using the metaphor or we're using the

00:13.880 --> 00:16.720
example of doing this with physical real estate.

00:16.720 --> 00:23.320
So if we had a house or let's say that we had two houses, exact same square footage,

00:23.320 --> 00:30.160
exact same bedrooms, exact same everything and one of these homes had nice finishes.

00:30.160 --> 00:37.520
One of them had, you know, upgraded tile, upgraded fixtures, maybe it had heated floors,

00:37.520 --> 00:40.360
maybe it had like a sauna inside.

00:40.360 --> 00:45.880
That house, even though it's the same structure, could potentially sell for a lot more.

00:45.880 --> 00:50.360
So though I think it's kind of a funny example because our websites are not that pretty,

00:50.520 --> 00:54.480
I'm just giving you an example because what we do with our on page SEO, we can have two

00:54.480 --> 01:00.640
different websites, one with spectacular on page SEO that can generate way more calls

01:00.640 --> 01:06.280
than the exact same website that looks basically the same, almost identical, that does not

01:06.280 --> 01:09.000
have the on page SEO done correctly.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.960
And therefore the first one would generate almost infinitely more leads.

01:13.960 --> 01:17.560
And why is that for those of you that are still wrapping your head around this?

01:17.560 --> 01:21.880
Because if we do the on page SEO correctly, we're going to rank our website and if we

01:21.880 --> 01:25.520
rank our website, we're going to get organic traffic as long as it converts.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.720
But I know it's going to convert because I'm showing you guys exactly what these websites

01:28.720 --> 01:29.720
need to look like.

01:29.720 --> 01:35.280
Long story short, guys, SEO, there are two different sections or two different parts

01:35.280 --> 01:36.280
to SEO.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.320
There's the on page and then there's the off page.

01:38.320 --> 01:42.520
And we are going to talk about the on page SEO, which is exactly as it sounds, the things

01:42.520 --> 01:44.640
that you do on the page.

01:44.640 --> 01:48.120
So a couple of those things, and I'm just going to mention a few, and then we're going

01:48.120 --> 01:53.760
to have individual sections, individual lessons talking about each one and showing you exactly

01:53.760 --> 01:55.480
how to do each one.

01:55.480 --> 01:59.120
Some of the elements to on page SEO.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.120
Page titles.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.680
And we're going to go into that, but that is what we actually title the page when you

02:03.680 --> 02:08.600
are on your browser and you hover over the tab, what is that thing that pops up?

02:08.600 --> 02:09.600
What is the page title?

02:09.600 --> 02:14.240
Or when you go to Google and you type in concrete near me, what is that title that's underlined?

02:14.720 --> 02:16.320
That's the page title.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.120
We're also going to talk about the descriptions.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.180
What do we put in the description?

02:20.180 --> 02:21.800
How do we get people to click?

02:21.800 --> 02:23.400
How many characters can we do?

02:23.400 --> 02:25.400
We're going to talk about H1s.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.400
We're going to talk about image optimization.

02:26.400 --> 02:30.000
We're going to talk about a lot of different elements of on page optimization.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.160
For some of you that might be junkies with this stuff, we're not going to go into every

02:35.160 --> 02:38.600
little teeny thing, but we're going to talk about the most important things, the things

02:38.600 --> 02:42.360
that have helped us and they have worked again and again and again and again.

02:42.520 --> 02:48.440
These are the things that we do, always keeping in mind that if we do the job correctly with

02:48.440 --> 02:53.640
what we talked about in module one of part one, looking for layups, we can eliminate

02:53.640 --> 02:56.640
competition.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.480
That is why I stress so much that we choose the right city and the right niche because

03:00.480 --> 03:07.000
if the competition is not that great, we don't have to do all this stuff perfect.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.240
We're going to do it as best we can and you're going to get better as you go, as you do this.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.800
We're going to show you step by step exactly what to do in future videos.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.200
Guys, get ready.

03:18.200 --> 03:23.840
Let's figure out how we can master the elements of on page SEO and we'll see you in the next

03:23.840 --> 03:24.340
video.
