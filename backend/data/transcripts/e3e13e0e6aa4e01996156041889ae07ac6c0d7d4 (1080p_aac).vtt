00:00.000 --> 00:03.420
["Take Me By Your Side"]

00:10.460 --> 00:11.600
Guys, welcome to the setup.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.820
I wanna talk about what the setup actually is.

00:14.820 --> 00:16.820
Okay, first of all, most people,

00:16.820 --> 00:18.100
when they train you sales,

00:18.100 --> 00:20.140
no matter what sales training you go into,

00:20.140 --> 00:21.440
no matter who you talk to,

00:21.440 --> 00:24.540
most people just train you to wait for the objection

00:24.540 --> 00:26.300
and then how to overcome that objection

00:26.300 --> 00:27.900
or how to try to overcome that objection.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.700
For example, when the customer says,

00:29.700 --> 00:31.180
I wanna think about it, you say this.

00:31.180 --> 00:32.900
When the customer says I need to talk to my spouse,

00:32.900 --> 00:34.700
you say that, okay?

00:34.700 --> 00:37.080
And that's exactly how I was trained.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.700
But I realized that they're testing

00:38.700 --> 00:39.740
a couple of different things

00:39.740 --> 00:42.860
and just trial and error,

00:42.860 --> 00:46.940
that the times when I brought up the objection first,

00:46.940 --> 00:49.100
it always seemed to be a non-objection

00:49.100 --> 00:50.980
when I got to the closing table, okay?

00:50.980 --> 00:52.820
And I learned this very early on.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.420
And so I wanna relate this to,

00:54.420 --> 00:57.460
if you have kids or just think back to when you were a kid,

00:57.500 --> 00:59.940
and I'm guessing this is probably the situation.

00:59.940 --> 01:03.260
But for me, for example, if my kid does something stupid,

01:03.260 --> 01:05.860
first of all, I'm gonna be mad no matter what, right?

01:05.860 --> 01:08.700
But if I find out from their own mouth,

01:08.700 --> 01:10.700
they come to me and say, hey dad, look man,

01:10.700 --> 01:14.020
I broke the iPad, I'm gonna be ticked, right?

01:14.020 --> 01:16.020
But I'm gonna be a lot less ticked

01:16.020 --> 01:19.400
than if I just find a broken iPad lying on the ground.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.140
So it's the same exact thing.

01:21.140 --> 01:22.900
We know the objections are gonna come

01:22.900 --> 01:25.900
and we're never gonna be able to avoid them,

01:25.900 --> 01:27.780
whether it's now, whether it's later,

01:27.780 --> 01:30.340
the objections will always come.

01:30.340 --> 01:34.100
So why don't we just go and meet the objection?

01:34.100 --> 01:36.380
Why don't we just offensively go meet the objection,

01:36.380 --> 01:40.260
overcome them all in the setup phase

01:40.260 --> 01:42.380
so that we don't have to deal with objections?

01:42.380 --> 01:44.460
That's an interesting way to think about it, right?

01:44.460 --> 01:46.660
And so I've heard something along the lines of,

01:46.660 --> 01:47.940
and I've heard this from multiple people,

01:47.940 --> 01:51.460
it's like the better your questions are,

01:51.460 --> 01:52.860
the better the results that you're gonna get.

01:52.860 --> 01:54.380
Something, I think I know I butchered that,

01:54.380 --> 01:56.340
but whatever, you get the point, right?

01:56.340 --> 01:59.460
And so instead of asking how do I overcome

01:59.460 --> 02:01.260
I wanna think about it,

02:01.260 --> 02:04.820
let's start asking how do we just avoid objections

02:04.820 --> 02:07.860
or how do we just not have objections

02:07.860 --> 02:09.660
during the Zoom close?

02:09.660 --> 02:11.800
Well, I found a way and that is

02:11.800 --> 02:14.060
we're gonna meet the objections head on

02:14.060 --> 02:16.620
and we're gonna overcome them before they even come up.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.460
So the setup, just to define it,

02:18.460 --> 02:22.420
is the period from the moment you call and do the hook

02:22.420 --> 02:24.860
until the moment you jump on the Zoom close

02:24.860 --> 02:27.040
and do the close, okay?

02:27.040 --> 02:30.080
During that entire period, that is the setup.

02:30.080 --> 02:35.020
So guys, the close should and actually does happen

02:35.020 --> 02:37.460
during the setup for a couple of reasons, okay?

02:37.460 --> 02:39.460
And it should happen for a couple of reasons

02:39.460 --> 02:40.300
during this period.

02:40.300 --> 02:41.620
Number one is that it's not expected.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.980
Everyone expects you to get on the Zoom close

02:43.980 --> 02:46.660
and to have your spiel and get to the end

02:46.660 --> 02:49.060
and do the hard close and have all these sales techniques,

02:49.060 --> 02:52.060
but what they don't expect is to be closed

02:52.060 --> 02:53.900
during these initial calls.

02:53.900 --> 02:57.540
They don't expect to be closed during that initial hook.

02:57.540 --> 03:00.300
They don't expect to be closed during a screencast.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.100
They don't even know what a screencast is, right?

03:02.100 --> 03:03.300
So they definitely don't expect it.

03:03.300 --> 03:06.740
So number one is they don't expect

03:06.740 --> 03:08.300
to be closed during this period.

03:08.300 --> 03:12.260
The next thing is the business owner has their guard down

03:12.260 --> 03:13.460
during this period, okay?

03:13.460 --> 03:15.120
When they get on the Zoom close, make no mistake,

03:15.120 --> 03:16.300
they're expecting to be sold,

03:16.300 --> 03:18.340
they're expecting to be pitched something,

03:18.340 --> 03:20.740
but during this phase, they're really open,

03:21.540 --> 03:24.060
they're casual, they just don't expect it.

03:24.060 --> 03:25.180
They're watching a screencast

03:25.180 --> 03:27.060
and they're not expecting to be closed, okay?

03:27.060 --> 03:29.520
And so without them even knowing,

03:29.520 --> 03:32.280
we are overcoming objections in our conversations

03:32.280 --> 03:34.880
on the phone and our text messages during our screencast,

03:34.880 --> 03:36.620
they don't even realize it, okay?

03:36.620 --> 03:39.220
And the last thing is what I love about this,

03:39.220 --> 03:43.120
and this is why the deal should be closed during this phase,

03:43.120 --> 03:46.540
is this is gonna take the pressure off of that last call.

03:46.540 --> 03:48.580
That last call should be enjoyable.

03:48.660 --> 03:51.060
Last call should be quick and easy and breezy,

03:51.060 --> 03:52.580
and it should just be a matter of you getting

03:52.580 --> 03:54.900
the credit card and you guys getting excited

03:54.900 --> 03:56.340
about working together, okay?

03:56.340 --> 03:58.460
So it's going to take the pressure

03:58.460 --> 04:01.380
off of that big, scary, hard close,

04:01.380 --> 04:03.500
and that is why it should be,

04:03.500 --> 04:06.700
that is why the close should happen during the setup.

04:06.700 --> 04:11.500
The objective of the setup, very, very, very simple, okay?

04:11.500 --> 04:15.320
The objective is one thing, and that is to overcome

04:15.320 --> 04:19.680
all the objections that you could potentially have

04:19.680 --> 04:23.400
or that you know you will potentially have during this step.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.240
And then we're gonna do it strategically,

04:25.240 --> 04:27.220
we're gonna do it so it just makes sense,

04:27.220 --> 04:29.000
there's no pressure, that's it.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.820
The objective of this step is that we are going

04:32.820 --> 04:36.720
to overcome all the objections offensively,

04:36.720 --> 04:38.440
or what they used to teach me this word,

04:38.440 --> 04:39.480
I don't even know if this is a word,

04:39.480 --> 04:42.280
but we used to use the word preemptively,

04:42.280 --> 04:44.180
meaning before it actually comes up.

04:44.180 --> 04:46.700
The goal, the objective, is very simple.

04:46.700 --> 04:50.540
Overcome the objections before they ever become objections.
