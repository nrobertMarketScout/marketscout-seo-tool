What would you do if you happen to have a client in an area where search volume for any keyword is 10?

00:04.400 --> 00:07.440
Only way I was able to make it work was by expanding radius to 30 miles around the city.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.480
Do you just focus on surrounding area service pages? What is the best strategy to rank to

00:10.480 --> 00:14.240
get enough volume? That's going to be a tough one, especially because I don't even know,

00:14.240 --> 00:18.080
like 10 is going to be extremely tough. Biggest thing you're going to have to do is set expectations.

00:19.360 --> 00:24.240
And then I assume because there's only 10 that the city size is not that big,

00:24.240 --> 00:28.160
which means it's probably not super competitive unless it's carpet cleaning,

00:28.240 --> 00:33.840
which means you should be able to build a website in the main city and service page, or sorry,

00:33.840 --> 00:39.040
location pages in the surrounding cities and rank those fairly easily. So picture it like this,

00:39.040 --> 00:43.440
right? Let's use a city like Nashville because it's easy to explain. Although this wouldn't be

00:43.440 --> 00:46.640
the case because these surrounding cities are actually bigger, but just so you guys can picture

00:46.640 --> 00:53.280
this. Let's say that Nashville only had a search volume of 10 for carpet cleaning,

00:53.280 --> 00:57.040
which would never be the case, but let's just say it. Or we can even say something else. We

00:57.040 --> 01:00.880
could say excavation, which again, wouldn't be the case. Nashville is huge, but let's say it did.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.800
And you're like, crap, I need to figure out how to get more leads in some of these outskirts in

01:04.800 --> 01:13.440
Clarksville and excuse me, Murfreesboro in Lebanon and whatever the case is, right?

01:15.600 --> 01:20.240
What's some of the other cities? Why am I having a brain funk here? What's the other one after?

01:20.240 --> 01:25.680
Anyway, it doesn't matter. What I would tell you is that assuming that this city that you're

01:25.680 --> 01:31.040
targeting only has 10 volume, I'm guessing it's not a huge city. And I'm guessing the outskirts

01:31.040 --> 01:35.680
cities are not big either, which means they're probably not competitive. So what I would do is

01:35.680 --> 01:41.440
I would build the site. Let's say it's tree service Nashville. Maybe we should use it as a

01:41.440 --> 01:45.200
different example. Let's use a different example actually, because everyone's going to go and

01:45.200 --> 01:52.960
think this is the case. Let's use something everyone would know. I'll use Salt Lake City.

01:52.960 --> 01:57.440
You guys won't know what that is, but I can explain it to you. So Salt Lake City,

01:57.440 --> 02:02.640
I'm going to pull up a map here to explain this. And you guys can do the same thing.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.840
Type in Salt Lake City and go to a map. And I'm going to show you what I mean.

02:06.560 --> 02:11.200
So if I was trying to do this in Salt Lake City, what I would do is, and let's say Salt Lake City

02:11.200 --> 02:17.600
was only 10, right? The volume was 10 in whatever it is, excavation. What I would do is I'd build

02:17.600 --> 02:23.760
the main website as saltlakecityexcavation.com, whatever. And I would focus tons and tons and

02:23.760 --> 02:30.240
tons of energy on ranking there. Now, what I'd also say, Shane, is that if this deal is not a

02:30.240 --> 02:34.880
guaranteed done deal, I wouldn't mess with it, right? Is this a deal you're pre-selling or

02:34.880 --> 02:39.120
somebody came to you? Because if somebody's coming to me, it's one thing, but I'm not going to go

02:39.120 --> 02:43.760
into a city on my own dime that's only got 10. But let's say somebody did come to you.

02:43.760 --> 02:47.520
What I would do is I'd build the website in that main city that has a search volume of 10.

02:47.520 --> 02:54.160
And then I would have location pages. So it'd be saltlakecityexcavation.com forward slash

02:54.160 --> 03:01.520
bountiful. And in bountiful, I would treat Salt Lake City's excavation.com forward slash bountiful.

03:01.520 --> 03:06.160
That URL, I would treat it as its own homepage, right? That would be like a homepage because you

03:06.160 --> 03:11.760
are going to be ranking that page against everyone else in bountiful that's doing excavation.

03:11.760 --> 03:18.000
Then I'd have another location page would be saltlakecityexcavation.com forward slash west

03:18.000 --> 03:23.120
valley. Now, for those of you that know Salt Lake West Valley is not somewhere I'd build a website

03:23.120 --> 03:28.800
in because it's just not the spot. But just to give you an example, and I mean that because

03:28.800 --> 03:34.720
it's kind of a sketchy city, west valley, you know, west valley, saltlakecityexcavation.com

03:34.720 --> 03:39.360
forward slash west valley. And I have another one that was saltlakecityexcavation.com forward

03:39.360 --> 03:45.760
slash, let me zoom in a little more, we could say West Jordan, Salt Lake City, you know, and

03:45.760 --> 03:49.120
I'm looking at all these little pockets and I'm trying to do research the best that I can. You

03:49.120 --> 03:55.840
could have one forward slash Kearns forward slash Murray forward slash Woods Cross forward slash

03:55.840 --> 04:01.280
North Salt Lake. That's how I would do it to try and, you know, get as many leads as possible. But

04:01.280 --> 04:07.680
again, I wouldn't even go into the city knowing there's only 10 volume unless somebody came to me

04:07.680 --> 04:11.200
and was like, hey, I really need leads in the city because if somebody came to me and said they

04:11.200 --> 04:15.840
just need leads, I would just say, well, what other areas do you cover besides this city?

04:15.840 --> 04:20.480
Because it doesn't have that much volume. I'll do it for you. But can you do other cities? Can

04:20.480 --> 04:24.240
we look at something else? That's what I would do. Okay. Hopefully that made sense. Sorry,

04:24.240 --> 04:27.040
I get a little long-winded trying to explain that. I want you guys to understand where my

04:27.040 --> 04:30.160
thought process is, but that's what I would do. And that's from experience.
