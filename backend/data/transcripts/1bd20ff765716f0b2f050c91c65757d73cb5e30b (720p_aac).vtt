Marcus says, what type of ROI do you like to see on your ad spend?

00:02.560 --> 00:09.440
If you spend 10K in ad spend, what do you want to see come in for revenue?

00:09.440 --> 00:20.320
So Marcus, I am willing to spend up to about 60% of my total deal size on ads.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.840
So if it's a thousand dollar deal, I'll spend up to 60%.

00:23.840 --> 00:24.720
So do the math on that.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.880
But if I get a thousand dollar deal, I'll spend 20 bucks a day

00:28.880 --> 00:34.320
because then that gives me enough to spend money on content writers and employees and etc.

00:34.320 --> 00:35.680
And still make a profit.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.480
Anything above that, it's too thin.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.480
The margins are too thin and I don't like it.

00:40.480 --> 00:44.480
So about 60%, I'll spend up to 60% on my ads.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.720
Yeah, that's what I would recommend.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.120
Okay.
