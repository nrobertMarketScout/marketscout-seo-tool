00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
What about when the client says for us it's all about conversion and to win the and then they through that

00:06.240 --> 00:09.640
Let's see what happens with the free leads you sent us. That's a great question

00:09.640 --> 00:14.320
I've covered this and I'm gonna cover this again. So one I've had this happen. I had this happen recently

00:15.160 --> 00:20.420
In fact, I'll tag you in a video one. There's a video that I'm gonna share with you. So client says

00:21.800 --> 00:26.280
They say hey, let's see what happens these leads. Okay, I did a

00:26.920 --> 00:32.480
Specific lie for this thing was on a Friday two Fridays ago. So here's what I say is I say hey look mr. Business owner

00:33.520 --> 00:36.360
If I sent you let's so let's say you've sent in three leads

00:36.360 --> 00:40.400
I say hey if those three leads that I sent you if you close all three of those

00:40.400 --> 00:43.440
Is it safe to assume you're gonna close a hundred percent of them?

00:44.080 --> 00:50.360
Well, no, of course not. Okay. Well if you close zero of those three leads

00:50.360 --> 00:53.520
Is it safe to assume that you're gonna close zero leads? Well, no

00:54.080 --> 00:56.360
Okay, so the reason I'm bringing that up because

00:57.520 --> 01:03.560
We can't base this off of three leads unless you're a hundred percent closer basing us off of three leads is the most

01:03.760 --> 01:05.960
Short-sighted move we could ever make in the world

01:06.600 --> 01:12.240
because and I say that say I work I've worked with some people in the past where I sent them ten leads they've closed zero and

01:12.240 --> 01:17.360
Then the next ten leads they closed seven out of ten and they average almost 40% close rate

01:17.600 --> 01:22.800
So I'm not sending you like that. I hope you didn't misunderstand me. Mr. Business owner

01:22.800 --> 01:28.440
I'm not sending you guys this just so you could like and so I'm not gonna keep sending you leads for you to close the

01:28.440 --> 01:34.720
Deal I'm sending you these leads so you can see the quality of the lead knowing that it is a numbers game

01:34.760 --> 01:38.920
Okay, so I just don't want you to get confused. I'm sending you a couple whether you close them or not

01:38.920 --> 01:42.320
That's on you. You don't have to pay me. Those are free. That's on you

01:42.720 --> 01:47.160
But we need to talk in three days something like that because guys it's ridiculous

01:47.560 --> 01:50.920
Like think about that think about like and I'm glad you brought this up dude

01:51.080 --> 01:55.280
Like the people like what kind of balls these people have hey, thanks for the free

01:56.160 --> 01:59.280
Like think about this. Hey guys

01:59.960 --> 02:02.520
Hey one appreciate the free leads

02:04.000 --> 02:11.360
Let me see if I make any money from those free leads to add further value to what you've already given me for free and

02:11.800 --> 02:18.080
Then and only then will we talk then and only then will we do business on screw that person

02:18.120 --> 02:24.360
Okay, so to me what that that might be like if you're getting that a lot and some people just have that in their mind

02:24.360 --> 02:27.320
If you're getting that a lot, that's probably something that you're you're doing in the call

02:27.840 --> 02:32.120
That first call where you need to kind of you need to do that pullback

02:32.120 --> 02:36.640
You need to do what we talked about today with like this is a perfect example from today

02:36.640 --> 02:44.080
Hey, like in your own way, you need to let them know that this this is not this isn't contingent upon them closing leads period

02:44.600 --> 02:47.080
I'm sending you the leads so you can test them out

02:47.720 --> 02:50.480
But this is a numbers game and I send you 20 leads

02:50.760 --> 02:56.640
Okay, how many how many you how many free leads you want? Right? You're in business. I don't run a non-profit neither do you?

02:56.840 --> 02:58.120
I'm gonna send you a couple

02:58.120 --> 03:02.820
I'm happy to send you a couple more but we can't wait like if that's the game you're playing this isn't gonna work like

03:03.280 --> 03:08.680
Be bold know your worth like that person right there if they say oh, well then this doesn't work. Cool

03:08.680 --> 03:12.320
Walk away from that deal. This is a that's a perfect example of what we talked about today

03:12.760 --> 03:17.960
Is this the kind of shit people pull I had that's it was Ricardo Ricardo's the one that did that shit to me

03:17.960 --> 03:19.960
He's like hey, man. Yeah

03:20.440 --> 03:23.840
We'll see what comes to these leads and then and then we'll talk no, no, no

03:23.840 --> 03:28.600
That's not how so this does not work like that Ricardo wrong guy wrong place wrong time

03:29.160 --> 03:32.160
And I said that exact thing I just said and I said no we're gonna talk

03:32.160 --> 03:35.600
I'm gonna send you one more thing. We're gonna talk and then he goes to me cool

03:35.960 --> 03:38.860
Go smell you want Ricardo, but I'm not doing business with you
