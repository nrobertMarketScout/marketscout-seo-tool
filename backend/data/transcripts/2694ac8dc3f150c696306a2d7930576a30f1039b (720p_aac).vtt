WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
Website, running it out, lead generation.

00:03.320 --> 00:03.840
Oh, there we go.

00:03.840 --> 00:09.560
Recording started lead generation, building a website and ranking it is the

00:09.560 --> 00:14.800
exact same skillset as having an SEO client who you build a website for and

00:14.800 --> 00:17.480
do the SEO you don't own the website.

00:17.480 --> 00:23.520
The client does, but in my mind, I wanted to make, you know, I wanted to make

00:23.520 --> 00:29.200
lead gen work, but then I saw opportunities coming my way for easy wins.

00:29.760 --> 00:34.360
And, you know, business owners, I knew connections I had, Hey, can you do my

00:34.360 --> 00:39.680
website for me now that they knew I had that skillset and I was like, man, I

00:39.680 --> 00:43.440
would way rather work for you than work for my job, right?

00:43.760 --> 00:45.600
So I'm like, okay, I can do that.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.600
And we structure a deal.

00:47.960 --> 00:48.440
Okay.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.480
500 bucks a month.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.560
I'll build you a new website and I won't charge you for the new website

00:53.560 --> 00:56.440
build, even though it's a website development.

00:56.480 --> 01:02.640
Like I can do it so well with employees worldwide, so cheap.

01:02.840 --> 01:06.080
I can build a website for $40 is my cost.

01:06.440 --> 01:10.840
I'll do that for free and you just pay me 500 bucks a month and you'll get the

01:10.840 --> 01:13.280
website, you'll get the SEO work, you'll get everything.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.160
And now I have these cash reserves.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.360
And so once that clicked for me, I was like, wow, I just need to take those

01:19.400 --> 01:23.200
easy wins and yeah, lead gen is awesome.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.360
Keep building that, keep building those sites, keep ranking those things.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.400
But I want to get out of my job ASAP.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.440
And that's what clicked for me.

01:29.440 --> 01:33.720
And I was like, okay, if I can do it once, you know, I bought this program,

01:34.160 --> 01:37.960
um, your program and another program to learn.

01:38.560 --> 01:42.760
And it took me like four months and I was grinding, grinding, making no money

01:43.040 --> 01:44.880
until that first deal kind of came my way.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.360
And I was like, okay, I have the skillset.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.080
I'm going to do it.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.800
And I took that first one.

01:50.200 --> 01:55.600
And then I was like, wow, if I can just once the sites built and they're on,

01:55.760 --> 01:59.520
it's just like mailbox money, 500 bucks a month, 500 bucks a month.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.440
Um, and my team would just handle it.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.160
And it was easy.

02:03.480 --> 02:07.200
So I was like, man, if I can just stack those and get a hundred of those, get

02:07.200 --> 02:10.840
150, get 200, that'll be life changing.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.160
And that's exactly what happened.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.520
So that's been the big breakthrough.

02:14.520 --> 02:19.280
Like I think the main concept is like going from zero to one.

02:19.320 --> 02:24.200
That's where people that are at jobs struggle with is getting the first client.

02:24.680 --> 02:29.240
And so in my mind, I want to make getting the first client as easy as possible,

02:29.560 --> 02:33.360
because once you have that first client, then the flood gets open because now the

02:33.360 --> 02:35.120
pressure is on to deliver, to learn.

02:35.360 --> 02:39.560
You'll learn way faster, get two, three, four, five, and your business will grow.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.840
But you just got to go from zero to one.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.040
So many people get stuck at that zero stage.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.960
If you can get one, then you're rolling.

02:46.040 --> 02:46.560
You're going.

02:46.880 --> 02:47.160
So,

02:47.600 --> 02:52.520
so the, the, the thing that is that Zach's kind of alluding to is that.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.200
He was smart and he started targeting people.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.240
And we're going to get into that a little bit, but he started targeting people who

02:59.240 --> 03:01.720
already were paying for SEO services.

03:01.720 --> 03:02.600
He wasn't going in.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.800
My problem was I was trying to sell everyone SEO.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.280
I was trying to sell the water bottle company, the restaurant, you know,

03:08.280 --> 03:11.000
cause everyone technically could benefit from SEO, right?

03:11.000 --> 03:15.600
Every single company, the Kleenex brand, everyone can benefit from SEO.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.640
And I was trying to go and sell people on SEO and on why they should use me.

03:19.920 --> 03:24.320
And Zach realized there's a subset of the market out there that are already paying

03:24.760 --> 03:30.560
300, 500, $700 a month, and all he's got to do is switch them over to his service.

03:30.560 --> 03:35.080
Give them a much pre, a much more premium service for the same price, or

03:35.080 --> 03:38.560
even a little bit less, and dude, these people are set it and forget it.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.480
These people are going to be paying this bill forever.

03:41.640 --> 03:47.840
So, uh, Zach, how does somebody go from the zero to one?

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Like, let's just use an example, um, Killpot 5000.

03:52.160 --> 03:56.000
I'm not sure what your real name is, but let's just say Killpot's sitting in a

03:56.000 --> 04:00.720
nine to five job and is tired of freaking trading their time for dollars,

04:00.720 --> 04:05.840
waking up, punching the clock, barely making it work, not able to go to the

04:05.840 --> 04:11.080
gym because they're tired, coming back depressed, no money, no, nothing's

04:11.080 --> 04:15.080
exciting about their situation and they want to go and they want to make that

04:15.120 --> 04:16.120
first deal.

04:16.520 --> 04:19.400
How does somebody go from zero to one if they want to start today?

04:21.720 --> 04:22.640
Awesome question.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.960
When I started, I thought, what is the lowest hanging fruit?

04:26.960 --> 04:28.360
What is the easiest sale?

04:28.880 --> 04:30.600
And it's through your network.

04:30.960 --> 04:36.240
So any business owner that you know, you just, you don't want to go in pitching,

04:36.440 --> 04:38.360
but you want to just go and ask him questions.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.680
You want to learn, you want to ask him questions.

04:40.680 --> 04:41.760
Hey, how's your business doing?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.080
How are you guys doing online?

04:43.080 --> 04:44.160
How do you like your website?

04:44.840 --> 04:45.960
How are you guys ranking?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.440
What would you like to do better online?

04:47.880 --> 04:51.840
And you just start the discussion and they'll just be honest with you

04:51.840 --> 04:52.800
because they trust you.

04:53.280 --> 04:57.840
So you have your network, but then a step further is anybody, you know,

04:58.240 --> 04:59.400
that knows a business owner.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.040
So then once I talked to someone, I'd be like, awesome.

05:02.040 --> 05:02.120
Yeah.

05:02.120 --> 05:05.120
Do you know any other business owners I could talk to that might be

05:05.120 --> 05:06.320
wanting to grow their business?

05:07.040 --> 05:11.600
And of course, tons and tons of business owners want to grow their business.

05:12.080 --> 05:16.360
So if you just work your network, you can usually get anywhere from

05:16.360 --> 05:18.800
three to 10 deals right there.

05:19.160 --> 05:22.240
And those initial deals are really important because it'll build your

05:22.240 --> 05:24.360
confidence and you can go from there.

05:24.920 --> 05:29.880
Once you've kind of worked your immediate network, their network, then

05:30.080 --> 05:36.000
it's like just people around you in your, in your city, in your neighborhood,

05:36.360 --> 05:39.760
business owners that where it's easy, like, Hey, yeah, I live right down the street.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.800
You know, I'm in, I live in queen Creek, Arizona.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.680
I'm like, yeah, I'm right here in queen Creek.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.280
Um, I'd love to just, you know, kind of talk to you about your

05:48.280 --> 05:50.040
business a little bit, like, how are you guys doing?

05:51.040 --> 05:53.920
And since you have a tie to them, you have a connection.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.600
It's an easy conversation starter.

05:57.160 --> 06:02.400
Um, especially when you're new, people get nervous, but essentially if you're

06:02.400 --> 06:06.520
able to get someone to open up and you ask these questions I'm talking about,

06:06.920 --> 06:10.480
they open up and then you just say, Oh, cool.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.040
You want to do this thing.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.800
I actually have the skills to do that thing.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.760
How much are you currently paying for your current thing that you're getting

06:18.760 --> 06:20.640
now for your website, for your SEO?

06:21.080 --> 06:22.920
Oh, 300 bucks a month.

06:23.400 --> 06:23.720
Awesome.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.480
I'll do it for that same price and I'll give you way better service.

06:27.520 --> 06:31.920
And I'm here local and you know, list goes on and on and I'm a small business

06:31.920 --> 06:33.960
instead of that big company that you're with.

06:34.360 --> 06:39.240
So those are some initial thoughts for dual from zero to one network, their

06:39.240 --> 06:42.480
network, people in your neighborhood, and then just calling businesses.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.040
Like you got to put in the reps.

06:45.440 --> 06:49.880
So if you have zero clients and you're trying to get the first one, talk with

06:49.880 --> 06:51.400
five business owners every day.

06:51.880 --> 06:57.080
And that consistency will get you one client, two clients, you'll get better

06:57.080 --> 07:00.440
at it, three clients, four clients, and it'll start building and that momentum

07:00.440 --> 07:01.560
will just carry you forward.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.840
So that's kind of what I'd say to go from zero to one.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.520
So that's what I did.

07:06.840 --> 07:11.200
Did you just make a list of all like being pretty practical here on steps?

07:11.200 --> 07:14.000
Did you just sit there and go, okay, here's all the people that I know that

07:14.040 --> 07:16.920
are owned businesses and then let me send them a message.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.720
Let me call them.

07:18.720 --> 07:19.560
Like, what was that?

07:19.560 --> 07:20.680
What would that look like?

07:20.720 --> 07:23.680
Was it just like, here's every single person that owns a business in

07:23.680 --> 07:25.280
general or these types of businesses?

07:25.280 --> 07:27.520
Or how did you, did you just compile a list?

07:28.040 --> 07:28.720
Great question.

07:28.880 --> 07:33.320
I literally pulled up a Google sheet with my free Gmail, pulled up a Google

07:33.320 --> 07:40.440
sheet and I wanted business owners that were like service businesses, which I

07:40.920 --> 07:44.360
don't really know many other business owners that aren't like providing a

07:44.360 --> 07:48.400
service, maybe there's like an e-commerce business, I wouldn't focus on that.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.440
Maybe there's manufacturing, wouldn't do that.

07:50.560 --> 07:54.800
But most business owners that, you know, in your neighborhood are going to be

07:54.800 --> 07:57.120
small business owners and that those are great people to talk to.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.640
So I just pulled up a Google sheet and I just started writing names,

08:00.680 --> 08:01.600
just brainstorming.

08:02.080 --> 08:06.040
Once I ran out of names, I pulled up my phone and I just started slowly going

08:06.040 --> 08:09.560
through the hundreds of contacts in my phone and adding somebody, adding

08:09.560 --> 08:10.720
somebody, adding somebody.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.080
And that was my simple first, like CRM to track what was going on with everybody.

08:17.400 --> 08:17.680
Right.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.480
So the first column was everybody's name.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.440
And then I went through my Facebook friends and I went through the

08:23.440 --> 08:28.480
whatever and got my list and maybe I have 20 to 30 people and I'm, it

08:28.480 --> 08:32.360
doesn't sound like many, but you start talking to them and you start realizing

08:32.360 --> 08:36.960
there's all these needs, all these unmet needs and people are generally

08:37.360 --> 08:40.720
unsatisfied with who they've worked with.

08:41.480 --> 08:46.160
Generally big marketing companies don't do a good job and don't care enough

08:46.160 --> 08:47.880
about each individual client.

08:48.120 --> 08:51.960
And so people are usually upset when they see a client that they don't

08:52.400 --> 08:56.600
usually upset, which makes an easy, easy sale to slide in and help them out.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.160
Or people don't understand things.

08:59.440 --> 09:04.160
So if you just have the knowledge and just teach people, um, they will kind

09:04.160 --> 09:08.000
of come to you as the expert, Hey, yeah, even if you don't work with me, I

09:08.000 --> 09:12.320
would recommend doing this, this, and this, um, you can do it on your own.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.680
I can help you do it and you can pay me to do it for you.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.040
Like, and that's the conversation that's get started.

09:17.400 --> 09:23.520
So I think like simple scales, the more simple you can make it, especially in

09:23.520 --> 09:27.040
the beginning, the more you're going to scale if you overcomplicate it and you

09:27.040 --> 09:31.560
start worrying about like, Oh shoot, how am I going to do, um, blog posts and

09:31.560 --> 09:33.960
back linking and all this complicated stuff is like, who cares?

09:34.000 --> 09:34.800
You don't have a client.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.800
Just make a very simple list.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.720
Start talking to those people.

09:40.040 --> 09:44.960
If you don't know the answers, pull up chat GPT and type in, Hey, what do I do

09:44.960 --> 09:45.280
here?

09:45.440 --> 09:47.880
And you can tell the person, Hey, yeah, that's a great question.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.440
I've actually haven't come across.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.160
So before, let me look it up real quick, figure it out.

09:54.200 --> 09:54.920
And you're like, okay.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.600
And live while you're talking to them, you're solving their problems and

09:57.600 --> 09:59.000
showing that you want to work with them.

09:59.360 --> 10:03.200
So I think just keep it really simple, build the list, use free works

10:03.240 --> 10:04.840
resources like Google sheets.

10:05.240 --> 10:08.440
And now, you know, you have the names, then you have your notes in the next

10:08.440 --> 10:13.320
column, this date, talk to them, make sure to call them again on Friday.

10:13.480 --> 10:13.800
Right.

10:13.800 --> 10:17.520
It's so basic, but that's why it's effective because you actually use it.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.920
So that's how I got started.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.920
Did you find that a lot of the people that you were reaching out to on your

10:22.920 --> 10:26.440
list were already paying for a similar type of service?

10:26.440 --> 10:31.080
They were paying somebody to host their website or were you basically, you

10:31.080 --> 10:35.360
know, having to, to get them to pay you something they weren't already paying?

10:37.920 --> 10:38.720
Awesome question.

10:39.280 --> 10:46.400
Um, almost everyone was paying for their website and is it's pretty rare for a

10:46.400 --> 10:52.000
business owner and an electrician, a plumber, a carpet cleaner to build their

10:52.000 --> 10:54.320
own website, it just takes too much time.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.320
Like they don't, they're focused on making money, doing plumbing, doing

10:58.320 --> 11:00.000
carpet, me doing whatever their thing is.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.400
And they don't think about it.

11:02.360 --> 11:08.120
When I, I, it always comes back to me to, in college, when I did sales, I

11:08.120 --> 11:10.400
sold door to door selling direct TV.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.920
And it was so hard.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.360
It was a gnarly experience.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.400
Like I was in Houston in the summer.

11:16.640 --> 11:19.600
It's like 105 degrees and humid.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.240
I'm just sweating like crazy.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.120
But in a hundred days, it was like a three month summer.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.040
I made $70,000 as a college kid.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.680
And I don't watch TV.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.680
Like I don't care about TV.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.640
It's it's I've never really cared about TV.

11:37.640 --> 11:40.080
And so you're like, man, how, how was that even possible?

11:40.880 --> 11:42.160
I didn't believe in the TV.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.480
What I believed in was saving people money.

11:44.800 --> 11:48.400
And I could save people money by switching them from dish network or

11:48.400 --> 11:50.840
AT&T, you verse to direct TV.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.680
And that switch was so easy.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.600
If they were paying $150 a month, I could get them all the same channels

11:58.600 --> 12:01.520
plus NFL Sunday ticket for $70 a month.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.840
So less than half the price.

12:04.400 --> 12:08.920
And they get every single football game the next fall and they get all the

12:08.920 --> 12:09.440
channels, right?

12:09.440 --> 12:11.760
So that switch was so easy.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.720
And that summer in a hundred days, I did 300 switches and made $70,000.

12:17.200 --> 12:22.200
So when I was learning Legion and learning websites and learning SEO, it

12:22.200 --> 12:23.720
kind of clicked all of a sudden.

12:23.840 --> 12:28.200
And I was like, Whoa, how could I get people that are already paying for

12:28.200 --> 12:33.080
this to just switch to me and I can give them more channels and NFL Sunday

12:33.080 --> 12:34.200
ticket, right?

12:34.640 --> 12:39.440
I was like, okay, I'm just going to find the people that are paying 300, 500,

12:39.440 --> 12:43.520
700 bucks a month, a thousand, whatever they're paying and match their

12:45.040 --> 12:48.600
bit and over deliver on the services.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.800
So, okay, you're paying $500 a month for your website and SEO.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.160
I'll do 500 bucks a month for your website and SEO.

12:56.480 --> 13:01.080
And I'll also help you with a Google review strategy and make you a custom

13:01.080 --> 13:05.040
link you can use, and you can call me anytime I'm way more accessible.

13:05.360 --> 13:09.880
And we actually write high quality content, you know, like all these things.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.320
They're like, Oh yeah, that's a no brainer.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.600
And when you're starting out, it's a no brainer for them.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.200
It's, it's no additional money.

13:16.440 --> 13:21.120
But for you, you just went from zero to making 500 bucks a month with one

13:21.120 --> 13:24.160
client, and that is a huge game changer.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.960
That's what I love seeing and love helping people do is like go from that

13:27.960 --> 13:31.560
zero to 500 to a thousand to 10,000.

13:31.560 --> 13:35.080
And when you hit 10,000 months, recurring revenue, most people are

13:35.080 --> 13:38.000
basically free to quit their job and just scale.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.520
And it's so fun to, to a lot to happen and help people do that.

13:41.600 --> 13:41.880
So,

13:42.320 --> 13:47.360
so for those that just jumped on, for those that aren't following, basically

13:47.360 --> 13:53.200
the strategy from a high level is using SEO, which is taking people's websites,

13:53.240 --> 13:57.920
ranking them on Google, you are going to go to your contact list, the people

13:57.920 --> 14:02.040
that you know, your warm network, especially, and specifically the home

14:02.040 --> 14:06.560
service businesses, you're going to go in with a wit, like it, with the mindset

14:06.560 --> 14:09.160
of I'm going to add value, I'm going to help, I'm going to see how I can add

14:09.160 --> 14:12.280
value and sure, if they want to pay me great, if not, I'm still going to be

14:12.280 --> 14:14.120
that person that's like adding value.

14:14.680 --> 14:18.120
You go in most likely, you're going to be able to offer them the exact same

14:18.120 --> 14:22.000
thing, plus one or two additional things, more value for the same price or less.

14:22.360 --> 14:27.360
And doing that strategy, you're going to be able to stack your first one, two,

14:27.360 --> 14:29.280
three, four, five, 10 clients.

14:29.640 --> 14:34.360
That's from a, from like, uh, that's a very simple, simplified way to say it,

14:34.360 --> 14:36.000
but that's essentially what strategy is.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.400
Right.

14:38.880 --> 14:39.200
Yeah.

14:39.240 --> 14:42.320
And then you just, um, always are improving that.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.080
So once you have a couple of clients and you're like, Whoa, these switches are

14:46.080 --> 14:52.680
easy, you start hearing more names of like, Oh, wow, this big marketing

14:52.680 --> 14:54.000
company does a terrible job.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.520
These people do a bad job.

14:55.520 --> 15:01.640
This software is expensive and I can, you know, pull clients or cross sell.

15:01.640 --> 15:04.760
You know, they could have that software and use me for their site.

15:05.480 --> 15:11.480
Um, and you start, you know, getting lists and like attacking easy went.

15:12.200 --> 15:16.920
And that's how I just really start snowballing is you're like, wow, I can

15:16.920 --> 15:21.720
just hone in on exactly who I want to target for some people it's, it's

15:21.720 --> 15:25.720
niches like, Ooh, I'm, I'm really good with carpet cleaners because my dad owns

15:25.720 --> 15:28.320
a carpet cleaning company, I'm going to focus on carpet cleaners.

15:28.480 --> 15:32.800
I can speak their language or other people, you know, find a company.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.520
This big marketing company is terrible.

15:35.960 --> 15:36.840
No one likes them.

15:36.840 --> 15:37.840
They have terrible reviews.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.200
I'm just going to pull people over.

15:39.760 --> 15:44.360
Um, and so figuring out those strategies has been huge.

15:44.760 --> 15:45.240
Yeah.

15:45.560 --> 15:48.800
So the, the initial few clients is just hitting your network.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.240
And then from there, you've got to have a bigger strategy.

15:51.240 --> 15:54.080
That's something that you can, you could turn into a system.

15:54.320 --> 15:58.160
And that's what Zach, the reason that Zach's been able to get to $56,000 per

15:58.160 --> 16:02.160
month is not because he's got a network with that many people, but his initial

16:02.160 --> 16:05.080
clients in that, I think you're right, dude, it's the same thing with digital

16:05.080 --> 16:05.880
real estate, right?

16:06.160 --> 16:10.960
Going from zero to one gives you all the confidence in the world to, Oh my

16:10.960 --> 16:12.560
gosh, this is actually going to work.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.800
And then the second deal becomes easier.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.520
And the third deal and the fourth deal and the fifth deal.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.920
And so guys, the reason why.

16:20.240 --> 16:26.280
I didn't do SEO correctly is first and foremost, I was targeting big juicy

16:26.280 --> 16:28.960
retainers because that's what I like to do with digital real estate.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.880
I like to get thousand 1500.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.640
I had a client, an SEO client.

16:32.840 --> 16:35.160
It was paying me $4,000 per month.

16:35.760 --> 16:39.440
And honestly, that was the same client that caused me to stop doing SEO.

16:39.440 --> 16:44.200
Because while I was on vacation, that same individual called me and canceled

16:44.200 --> 16:49.440
and it like completely just ruined my vacation because it took like 40% of

16:49.440 --> 16:52.840
my 40 or probably like 50% of my revenue at that point.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.800
And what Zach does is he goes in strategically and goes to people that

16:56.800 --> 17:01.440
are already comfortable paying a small micro bill and they have been, and

17:01.440 --> 17:02.600
he's just switching them over.

17:02.600 --> 17:06.080
Instead of selling someone on this new concept, he's taking people that are

17:06.080 --> 17:09.880
already paying in general and just funneling that money into himself.

17:10.000 --> 17:10.200
Yeah.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.400
He does a little bit of work upfront.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.200
And then after that, a lot of it set it and forget it.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.920
The second thing that he did really well, it's genius.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.800
And if you guys are like, man, this might distract me guys.

17:19.800 --> 17:24.280
If you do what Zach's doing, which is targeting home service businesses, you

17:24.280 --> 17:28.400
can literally go target your future digital real estate clients.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.880
Like you could go in and say, Hey, I'm only going to target clients in tree

17:31.880 --> 17:35.600
service or concrete or spray foam insulation, and I'm going to go get their

17:35.600 --> 17:38.800
SEO, get in the door with their SEO at 500 bucks a month.

17:39.040 --> 17:39.720
And guess what?

17:39.720 --> 17:42.360
The only reason they want SEO is because they want leads.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.920
So now I got their trust.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.760
Now I'm going to take some of that money.

17:45.920 --> 17:50.480
I'm going to go set up a strategy using what Nick talks about, put up a landing

17:50.480 --> 17:55.280
page to put an ad up, run some ads, get them additional leads and say, Hey, Mr.

17:55.280 --> 17:59.360
business owner, what do you think about buying these leads from my project as

17:59.360 --> 17:59.840
well?

18:00.160 --> 18:03.120
And now all of a sudden you have people that already trust you and it's the

18:03.120 --> 18:06.320
easiest sell in the world to go for that second, third, fourth money.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.360
So I wish I had done this.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.600
I was an idiot.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.160
I was literally taking, I had a.

18:12.440 --> 18:15.840
A client that had a restaurant, a Mexican restaurant.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.560
I had a client that did like wedding performances, like wedding bands, like

18:21.560 --> 18:24.800
they would go and do like the, they like that type of a thing.

18:24.840 --> 18:27.960
Great clients by the way, but they just, I was so spread out, dude.

18:28.200 --> 18:32.800
And then I had like this foundation repair client that I had, uh, what else

18:32.800 --> 18:33.680
did I even have at the time?

18:33.680 --> 18:34.960
I had so many different things.

18:34.960 --> 18:38.840
I didn't know how to speak the language and guys, all these people did not have

18:38.840 --> 18:41.720
SEO, so I was a bill, right?

18:41.760 --> 18:44.920
Zach's going in and he's like, look, you already have a bill.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.680
Let me just, you just pay it to me instead.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.200
I'm going to give you a way superior service.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.560
And by the way, Zach, it's funny because I did door to door.

18:52.680 --> 18:57.000
I sold home security systems, not direct TV, but I had the exact same strategy

18:57.280 --> 19:01.360
is I realized really early on, dude, just go target the people that are already

19:01.360 --> 19:05.800
paying the whoever sold them the security the first time they did the hard work.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.040
They convinced them that they needed the bill.

19:08.280 --> 19:12.040
Now I just got to show them that my product, my offering is a better

19:12.040 --> 19:17.640
offering than theirs, simple, easy sale, no emotion, 20 minutes in and out.

19:17.640 --> 19:18.520
Boom, boom, boom.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.120
And I just made my commission.

19:20.120 --> 19:25.120
So, um, the beautiful thing about SEO, the beautiful thing about lead gen is

19:25.120 --> 19:27.000
that it's recurring, right?

19:27.200 --> 19:29.360
You get paid again and again and again.

19:29.520 --> 19:33.280
And Zach, I don't even think you've even gone and cashed in yet and went and

19:33.280 --> 19:35.600
sold the, the lead gen on the backend.

19:35.880 --> 19:40.280
But when you do, I think you're going to increase your revenue 10 to $20,000

19:40.280 --> 19:43.760
overnight, because you probably are sitting on, uh, I don't know how many

19:43.760 --> 19:46.640
clients and projects that you could go and sell, but I know you have such a

19:46.640 --> 19:47.480
good system right now.

19:47.480 --> 19:51.080
You're like, let me just keep, keep adding these on, but, um, let's talk

19:51.080 --> 19:52.040
about your business really quick.

19:52.040 --> 19:56.080
How many, how many clients is your $56,000 made up of?

19:58.520 --> 20:01.000
Um, we have like 170 clients.

20:01.560 --> 20:05.760
So your average clients between like, what, about three to 400 bucks?

20:06.320 --> 20:07.920
Three, three to 400 bucks.

20:09.240 --> 20:13.400
And a lot of them honestly, um, just stay forever.

20:13.400 --> 20:17.200
So if you look at like the lifetime value of a client, it's like over

20:17.200 --> 20:23.120
five, six, 7,000, because they just stay and pay that for so long.

20:23.520 --> 20:29.600
And like the clients that we lose over time, some people like will retire or

20:29.600 --> 20:34.440
like things like that or some, you know, it's like, it's like, Oh, are you

20:34.440 --> 20:36.600
going to like give your company to your son?

20:36.600 --> 20:38.120
One guy is actually, Hey, I'm retiring.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.120
And he's like, Oh, actually I'm going to give my business to my son.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.880
But now we still have him as a client.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.920
And he was just like, goes and goes and goes.

20:44.760 --> 20:52.880
And so over time, it's pretty crazy to see how like an easy sale and a system

20:52.920 --> 20:56.600
where it's just like, my team just takes care of these people and does their stuff.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.000
Very easy to set up that team.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.400
And now I never think about it.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.640
I never have a call.

21:02.800 --> 21:03.960
They don't have my phone number.

21:03.960 --> 21:08.280
They, they can email our support line or email my support team.

21:08.880 --> 21:12.720
And I don't even know when we lose clients anymore or get them.

21:12.720 --> 21:16.840
It's like, it's just so fractional small that we just keep adding them.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.320
And then here and there, someone retires, whatever happens.

21:19.320 --> 21:19.520
Right.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.760
But there's not the stress.

21:21.760 --> 21:25.840
There's the complete freedom of like the systems are going really well.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.480
And now I just think about the big picture stuff.

21:28.760 --> 21:31.520
How can I hire someone really cool to do this thing?

21:31.800 --> 21:35.280
How can I think of a new strategy for sales?

21:35.280 --> 21:36.360
And then my sales team does it.

21:36.360 --> 21:43.880
So it's been very, very fun to grow it and then just plug people in that are

21:43.880 --> 21:47.200
phenomenal at building websites, phenomenal at whatever they do and, and

21:47.200 --> 21:52.120
just watch it compound over time since people are so sticky and stay so long.

21:52.200 --> 21:52.960
It's really cool.

21:53.560 --> 21:54.720
Yeah, that's dope, dude.

21:54.960 --> 21:55.560
And you know what?

21:55.560 --> 21:59.360
I used to hate the idea of having a ton of clients like that, but what I love

21:59.360 --> 22:04.160
about having 150 clients is you have a business that's built brick by brick by

22:04.160 --> 22:10.280
brick that you literally placed each one and it took a while to build, but it's

22:10.280 --> 22:12.080
not going to crumble overnight, right?

22:12.160 --> 22:16.520
You don't have one huge client that's like literally got you by the fricking

22:16.520 --> 22:19.720
throat that's saying like, Hey, you better give me a better price or I'm going to

22:19.720 --> 22:24.320
quit, dude, you could lose five clients tomorrow and you really wouldn't actually

22:24.360 --> 22:24.800
feel it.

22:24.960 --> 22:25.720
You know what I'm saying?

22:25.720 --> 22:28.440
So that's, I like that strategy a lot.

22:28.560 --> 22:31.760
The other reason I like it is because again, dude, when you decide to monetize

22:31.760 --> 22:36.320
on the backend and you go and sell them lead generation, dude, if you can get 10%

22:36.320 --> 22:41.360
of those people at a thousand dollars a month, you know, 15% of those people,

22:41.360 --> 22:44.360
you're just increasing five, $10,000 per month right there.

22:44.440 --> 22:45.160
You know what I'm saying?

22:46.160 --> 22:46.440
Yeah.

22:46.800 --> 22:51.720
And the thing is like, I already know which people are perfect because there's

22:51.720 --> 22:55.600
trust there and they come to us and say, Hey, we want more leads.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.760
We want to run ads or do whatever.

22:58.200 --> 23:02.480
It's like, that's an inbound lead to sell.

23:02.520 --> 23:06.520
So you're perfectly positioned to do that.

23:06.880 --> 23:07.480
For sure.

23:07.840 --> 23:15.200
So tell everyone real quick, because dude, one thing that I realized when I started

23:15.240 --> 23:19.920
doing this, you know, my, my dream was like, dude, I want to become a millionaire

23:19.920 --> 23:21.600
by, you know, 30 years old.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.160
I think that's such a cliche answer.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.760
Everybody has, but that was me.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.440
I've been writing that down in my little journal since I was 18.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.080
And, and then when I hit it, it was like, okay, let's go bigger.

23:32.080 --> 23:32.840
Let's go bigger.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.160
And I've always like, I, then it's like, I want to be, I want to get

23:36.160 --> 23:37.000
a million dollars a month.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.520
Like that's, you know, the goal.

23:38.880 --> 23:42.520
And I thought like, and I was always speaking to this and dude, it was literally

23:42.520 --> 23:46.800
like a couple of weeks ago, I did a poll and I did it on here.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.480
I did it in the Facebook group.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.440
I did it to my digital landlords community.

23:50.440 --> 23:53.600
And I just asked everyone like, what do you guys want?

23:54.080 --> 24:01.680
And I put some options and it was like, uh, security, respect, um, whatever.

24:01.720 --> 24:06.120
And then somebody, I didn't even put this and somebody added freedom.

24:06.960 --> 24:09.600
And dude, everybody wanted that answer.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.440
And so I started like thinking about it and I was like, you know what?

24:13.240 --> 24:17.320
I think that like all that people want is they want to be able to make enough

24:17.320 --> 24:23.880
money to be free from their freaking job and from what they're doing right now

24:23.880 --> 24:25.920
and to go and do what they like to do.

24:26.160 --> 24:30.600
And so Zach, I want you to tell everyone, like what, when you started, tell

24:30.600 --> 24:32.360
everyone what, how your life was.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.400
The job that you had, what your schedule was like.

24:35.560 --> 24:38.400
And then I want you to tell everyone, like, and I know you're very humble, so

24:38.400 --> 24:41.520
you would never say much, but like, tell everyone, like some of the cool stuff

24:41.520 --> 24:46.800
you've done over the past in 2024, cause you're getting as bad as me, dude.

24:46.800 --> 24:50.200
Every time I call you or text you, you're in some other country surfing

24:50.200 --> 24:51.120
or something like that.

24:51.280 --> 24:55.040
So, but yeah, tell it really, we're kind of going backwards, but tell everyone

24:55.440 --> 25:00.680
your story as far as like where you were a couple of years ago, when you were

25:00.720 --> 25:05.000
still in the J O B and then tell everyone like what this year's looked like for you.

25:07.680 --> 25:12.840
Yeah, that is pretty interesting to think about that contrast and go back and

25:12.880 --> 25:16.920
enter that space of like December, 2021.

25:17.160 --> 25:18.160
Um, I still had a job.

25:18.160 --> 25:26.240
It was a sales job and, um, our manager, new manager was like, okay, you got to

25:26.240 --> 25:29.800
make a hundred cold calls a day because we don't have enough leads coming in.

25:30.080 --> 25:35.560
When I was just used to like closing deals and I was like, Whoa, wait a

25:35.560 --> 25:37.800
second, that's crazy.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.320
And I had a conversation with my wife.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.760
I was like, I really, really don't want to do this.

25:45.600 --> 25:51.120
If I'm going to call a hundred people a day to sell this software that the

25:51.120 --> 25:54.400
software company I was working for, if I'm going to do that, why don't I just

25:54.440 --> 25:57.360
call a hundred people a day for my own company?

25:58.040 --> 26:00.960
And I quickly was like, get me out of here.

26:01.160 --> 26:05.280
Like I'm hustling so hard building someone else's dream.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.800
It was a cool software, but I'm not, I don't truly care about it.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.080
Right.

26:09.080 --> 26:12.560
What I care about is helping small business owners like my dad that are

26:12.560 --> 26:15.720
target cleaners and small businesses succeed.

26:15.720 --> 26:17.120
So that was my mindset.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.520
And I was like, I have to get out of here ASAP.

26:20.040 --> 26:24.400
So, um, you know, it was like, it was like the handcuffs, like you had to, like,

26:24.600 --> 26:27.800
there was like check-in meeting 8 AM, check out 5 PM.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.840
Like it was remote.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.800
I was in my house, but it was like, it was like handcuffs.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.440
You had to like be on and your calls were being tracked.

26:35.440 --> 26:38.960
And I was just like, Whoa, this is the new manager came in and it was

26:38.960 --> 26:41.600
intense tons of calls to make every day.

26:41.920 --> 26:47.120
And then like, you know, everyone in the company ranked and just,

26:47.640 --> 26:48.680
just pretty intense stuff.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.200
And I was like, it was just heavy.

26:51.920 --> 26:56.440
And so then once I committed, I was like, my wife supported me and we're like,

26:56.440 --> 26:59.360
okay, I'll just like grind and hustle and build my own thing.

27:00.880 --> 27:05.000
What I did more and more over time is just essentially buying back my time.

27:05.320 --> 27:09.160
You know, most people, when you're working for income, you're

27:09.160 --> 27:10.480
trading your time for money.

27:11.440 --> 27:14.760
Um, once I owned my own company, I was making more money.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.720
I could trade my money for time.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.400
I could employ people.

27:19.480 --> 27:22.880
I could pay somebody and now they take care of all that work.

27:22.960 --> 27:24.840
And I would buy myself back my time.

27:25.160 --> 27:30.240
And so I just kept doing that month after month after month to now this year.

27:30.360 --> 27:36.640
Um, I mean, last year, beginning of 2023, I was still closing deals.

27:37.160 --> 27:39.160
Um, and then I was like, okay, I've hit a point.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.720
I no longer need to close deals for my company.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.320
And I hired a salesperson.

27:43.720 --> 27:50.200
I hired a customer support, hired an SEO team, hired, um, SDRs like.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.960
I hired everybody website builders and you know, it was, it was step by step.

27:55.280 --> 27:58.640
And then the last couple of key hires were like a salesman

27:58.640 --> 28:01.000
to completely take over sales and the sales team.

28:01.920 --> 28:04.920
And now that I have a sales team in place, all the systems in place,

28:05.000 --> 28:11.320
all the fulfillment in place, essentially, um, my day to day is.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.360
I could honestly do whatever I want whenever I want.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.360
I enjoy working and adding value.

28:18.360 --> 28:22.720
So like I still work and I, I love training my team, helping them up skill.

28:23.040 --> 28:28.040
I love hiring new people, um, going after new ideas and basically just

28:28.040 --> 28:30.080
leading the team to crush it.

28:30.640 --> 28:31.520
And that's what I'm all about.

28:31.520 --> 28:34.800
Now is just helping people grow, helping other businesses grow.

28:35.160 --> 28:39.960
Um, but yeah, like this year I went, it was kind of the last second thing.

28:40.680 --> 28:45.800
Some buddies were going to Nicaragua on a surf trip and they were like, um,

28:46.400 --> 28:49.280
they had their crew set, then someone dropped out and they're like, man,

28:49.280 --> 28:50.280
who could go last second?

28:50.320 --> 28:52.000
They called me and I'm like, yeah, I'm in.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.240
So then I just can all of a sudden pick up and go to Nicaragua.

28:55.840 --> 28:56.680
And it was epic.

28:56.680 --> 29:01.560
Like we just were in Nicaragua on the beach would swim out with our surfboards

29:01.560 --> 29:05.200
to a boat and the boat would drop drive up and down the coastline to the different

29:05.200 --> 29:05.840
surf spots.

29:06.040 --> 29:09.840
And we would just surf these different breaks that were incredible along the

29:09.840 --> 29:11.440
cliffs in Nicaragua.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.240
So that was, that was a fun trip.

29:13.280 --> 29:18.240
We went to Hawaii for like over a month and got an Airbnb on the beach.

29:18.440 --> 29:23.320
So our kids every day, we just wake up and walk out to the sand for a month.

29:23.320 --> 29:26.440
Like that was pretty life changing.

29:26.880 --> 29:32.080
Um, but I still feel like I was adding value because I was on the beach in

29:32.080 --> 29:35.000
Hawaii or I was in the house and I was reading good books, you know,

29:35.000 --> 29:36.120
and my kids is taking a nap.

29:36.120 --> 29:37.600
I'm reading a good book.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.040
And then I'm like, whoa, I'm just the idea guy now.

29:40.040 --> 29:43.720
So I get this idea and boom, I just train, train the team, teach the team and

29:43.720 --> 29:45.280
they, they take care of it.

29:45.280 --> 29:51.760
So the super fun spot to be, um, when you say freedom, that's what everybody wants.

29:51.760 --> 29:55.160
That's what I feel like this business model allows.

29:55.480 --> 29:56.840
Yes, you need to grind.

29:57.160 --> 30:02.040
You need to like hustle and get the first client, get that confidence, help those

30:02.040 --> 30:08.200
stack, but there is a huge piece of mind knowing you have over a hundred clients,

30:08.880 --> 30:13.160
plenty of money, plenty of savings, a team that's totally capable that you've

30:13.160 --> 30:17.280
trained and now you can kind of do what you want with your day to day.

30:17.720 --> 30:23.520
And one of the things that lights me up, like I have new goals now, like my

30:23.520 --> 30:29.920
lifetime vision, my 25 year goal is to help thousands of business owners grow

30:29.920 --> 30:31.920
their businesses and grow as people.

30:32.640 --> 30:36.280
So that's what I'm all about is just helping other businesses grow,

30:36.320 --> 30:37.720
helping other people grow.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.000
And so I love studying self-improvement business growth.

30:41.400 --> 30:45.120
And that's what I do now is just basically coach my team and then coach other

30:45.360 --> 30:47.000
business owners on how to grow fast.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.160
And it's so fulfilling.

30:49.200 --> 30:49.640
I love it.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.120
So that's kind of been a long answer to what this year's looked like for me,

30:53.120 --> 30:54.720
but it's been an amazing year.

30:55.200 --> 30:59.120
And when you were doing the job, you were making, I think I remember it was

30:59.120 --> 31:01.400
like, what was it after taxes?

31:01.400 --> 31:02.400
What was your take home?

31:04.840 --> 31:07.280
I would take home each month 4,600.

31:07.280 --> 31:11.520
I had like a 70,000 a year salary, but after taxes, you have 4,600 a month.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.160
$4,600 a month, dude.

31:14.240 --> 31:19.920
Um, can you imagine like now that you've experienced making $56,000 a month,

31:20.320 --> 31:26.720
dude, I do not know, and this is all due respect, but like, I don't know how

31:26.720 --> 31:29.400
people can live on less than like 15.

31:29.400 --> 31:30.680
Like, obviously I do.

31:30.680 --> 31:36.800
You cut the stupid stuff, but like when you're used to like not checking prices

31:36.800 --> 31:41.120
at the grocery store or on the menu and stuff, like it's, it's, it's mind blog.

31:41.120 --> 31:46.400
I don't know how at 4,600 bucks a month in 2024, how in the world people with it,

31:46.400 --> 31:51.520
with kids, with a spouse, dude, I couldn't even live on that single, bro.

31:51.840 --> 31:52.520
You know what I mean?

31:52.520 --> 31:55.440
Like it's, it's, it's bananas, dude.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.360
So, um, it's crazy.

31:58.360 --> 32:02.800
What I'm getting at is it's crazy that you're just at your six months away,

32:03.160 --> 32:08.000
six months away at any time from like completely buying your freedom or

32:08.040 --> 32:09.360
completely getting your freedom.

32:09.360 --> 32:14.360
And dude, there is nothing better than like, I always say this.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.600
It's like when your mom asks you to clean your room, it sucks.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.160
It sucked when you're a kid, right?

32:19.160 --> 32:20.760
My mom doesn't ask me to clean my room anymore.

32:20.760 --> 32:21.320
Thank goodness.

32:21.320 --> 32:25.360
I have, I, I, I do that myself or I pay somebody to do that.

32:25.720 --> 32:29.480
But when you, as a kid would go and like, Hey, I'm going to surprise my mom

32:29.480 --> 32:31.720
and just clean my room on my own, dude.

32:31.720 --> 32:32.880
It was amazing, right?

32:32.880 --> 32:34.160
You've got the, the energy.

32:34.160 --> 32:34.960
It's just like work.

32:34.960 --> 32:39.560
Like even though you and I don't have to work, I still wake up, dude, it's

32:39.560 --> 32:43.640
seven AM in Dubai, like I should probably be on a boat, you know?

32:43.840 --> 32:49.000
Uh, but I, I, I'm choosing to work and I don't have to work, but I enjoy it.

32:49.320 --> 32:51.480
And I like to build and I like to see that.

32:51.760 --> 32:55.240
But so when you're doing it because you want to, it's so much more fulfilling.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.160
You have energy to do it.

32:57.360 --> 33:00.560
So I know it's just like, when you're in a job and you have to go, dude,

33:00.560 --> 33:03.000
it freaking sucks, it freaking sucks.

33:03.280 --> 33:08.840
Um, like for example, uh, uh, Jersey shore devil, he actually just joined

33:08.840 --> 33:10.040
our digital landlords program.

33:10.040 --> 33:10.840
We were talking about this.

33:10.880 --> 33:14.960
He's, he does furniture sales and he's like, he makes really good money, but

33:14.960 --> 33:19.960
he has to travel to different locations and he has to go and he'd be, he said

33:19.960 --> 33:23.640
he would be in like Columbia and he would have to come and do it.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.600
And like, so we talked about this exact same thing.

33:25.600 --> 33:31.840
So, um, anyway, dude, it's, uh, the, the exciting part is for anyone listening

33:31.840 --> 33:37.520
right now, you are, I would say if you would put your head down, turn off the

33:37.560 --> 33:41.600
distractions, quit, get in quick, like chase and all this different stuff,

33:41.800 --> 33:47.080
pick one thing and do it for a solid six months, six months.

33:47.200 --> 33:50.240
I think that anyone in this stream could become free.

33:51.240 --> 33:54.560
Some people sooner, some people it's going to take them longer to learn.

33:54.560 --> 33:59.360
But I think six months is not unrealistic to think that by June, by

33:59.360 --> 34:04.480
mid summer of next year, not even by June, by May, by April, end of April,

34:04.480 --> 34:09.440
by freaking April fool's day, you could, you could completely have a different

34:09.440 --> 34:11.320
life or you don't have to answer to a boss.

34:11.320 --> 34:15.160
And then like there's a clear path that we're giving you guys.

34:15.160 --> 34:22.160
So anyway, um, dude, killer killer, uh, training today, bro.

34:22.240 --> 34:24.880
Hopefully this inspires some people, hopefully gives us some ideas.

34:24.880 --> 34:29.320
Again, guys, the business model of digital real estate is building

34:29.320 --> 34:32.560
sites, ranking them on Google with SEO.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.800
And then renting out the leads.

34:35.120 --> 34:38.440
So what Zach's doing is he picked one part of the process.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.280
He's just focusing on the SEO.

34:40.320 --> 34:43.600
He got really good at it and he's getting, he's stacking clients,

34:43.600 --> 34:45.080
he's stacking clients, he's stacking clients.

34:45.080 --> 34:48.960
So, um, if you are somebody like in a job, you're like, let me get out

34:48.960 --> 34:52.160
as soon as I possibly can, you're in a situation like Zach was, or I was in

34:52.160 --> 34:58.160
whatever, um, what we're going to do, Zach, I will put the link once this

34:58.160 --> 35:01.520
video goes live, I think I can go and edit the description.

35:01.880 --> 35:05.160
Um, let me see if I still have, actually, you know what I can do.

35:05.160 --> 35:06.160
I'm going to put your website.

35:06.160 --> 35:07.080
What is your website?

35:09.200 --> 35:14.960
Zach Kyle.co Z A C K P O W E L L dot C O.

35:15.720 --> 35:22.280
One thing I'll add on that thought too, is like, um, I had to kind of figure

35:22.280 --> 35:26.720
this all out on my own and it was the slow way it was the grind.

35:27.120 --> 35:27.480
Oh yeah.

35:27.480 --> 35:31.960
Now people that I teach and coach up, it's just like, dude, here

35:31.960 --> 35:33.400
is the exact way to do it.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.720
And it's insane.

35:35.880 --> 35:40.280
I even thought when I started helping people, Oh, this might take a year for them,

35:40.640 --> 35:42.920
but people have done it in three or four months.

35:42.920 --> 35:48.560
So the six months is like totally reasonable to go from zero to 10,000

35:48.560 --> 35:49.480
months recurring revenue.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.600
People have done it in four months.

35:52.320 --> 35:56.280
Like six months, many multiple people have done it in six months.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.440
It's totally possible.

35:57.840 --> 36:06.000
Where, like you're saying by April, like the, they say focus is follow

36:06.000 --> 36:07.600
one course until successful.

36:07.880 --> 36:12.720
If you just focus and do this for six months, your life is completely different.

36:13.040 --> 36:18.480
You go and you have, you now have that freedom to do what lights you up.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.080
Do whatever you're passionate about.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.760
Like it's amazing.

36:21.800 --> 36:26.240
So I would just encourage you, if you're on the fence, like just go from zero to

36:26.240 --> 36:30.960
one, you go from zero to one, that's the biggest sale of your life.

36:31.560 --> 36:36.480
Go from zero to one, and then it'll just start snowballing and you'll look back

36:36.480 --> 36:41.640
in April at today and be like, Whoa, Zach and Nick were telling me, and it's been

36:41.640 --> 36:44.960
six months and I've earned my freedom.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.080
It's like Braveheart, man.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.160
Everyone wants freedom.

36:48.160 --> 36:51.240
We don't actually realize like jobs aren't freedom.

36:51.880 --> 36:55.040
When you're an entrepreneur at heart, like you want that freedom, just go out

36:55.040 --> 36:56.560
and get it and commit.

36:56.840 --> 37:01.880
And it's just that daily consistency that your daily standard right now, your

37:01.880 --> 37:05.720
daily standards here, what you need to do is raise it and maybe your daily standard

37:05.720 --> 37:08.080
now becomes talking with 10 business owners every day.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.320
That's your new standard.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.480
You have to abide by it in six months.

37:11.680 --> 37:13.040
You've committed to that new standard.

37:13.040 --> 37:15.720
You'll see the results of that higher standard you committed to.

37:16.120 --> 37:17.880
So it's totally possible.

37:17.880 --> 37:19.760
I just hope everyone will do it.

37:19.920 --> 37:20.960
It's, it's amazing.

37:21.480 --> 37:22.000
Yeah.

37:22.040 --> 37:29.360
And, uh, I should add this, um, when I started digital landlords and, and, you

37:29.360 --> 37:33.280
know, all my free, my free pro my, sorry, my free group and everything.

37:33.280 --> 37:38.880
I'm I've been very, very cautious to not let people just come into my groups and

37:38.880 --> 37:44.800
start like trying to sell stuff or, you know, check this out because everyone's

37:44.800 --> 37:45.440
full of crap.

37:45.440 --> 37:45.960
You know what I mean?

37:45.960 --> 37:48.920
Like I see this happened inside of our free Facebook group, which by the way,

37:48.960 --> 37:56.080
you guys, we, we have a free Facebook group at, uh, art of Dre art of D re.com.

37:56.640 --> 37:59.200
Anyway, if I see somebody trying to sell something, dude, I kick them out.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.240
I don't even give them a warning.

38:00.680 --> 38:02.040
Um, because I hate that.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.400
Like they're just getting there like little snakes in the grass.

38:04.880 --> 38:10.680
Um, and so it's, there are very few people that I let onto my lives.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.160
Uh, there are very few people that I let, uh, become like an admin of my group.

38:16.040 --> 38:20.320
There's like a, the list is like two, um, because I want to make sure they actually

38:20.320 --> 38:23.840
know what they're talking about and they're actually making money doing what

38:23.840 --> 38:24.760
they're saying they're doing.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.520
And so Zach is one of those people.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.720
I would never just let somebody come on my life.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.920
And this is like the fourth or fifth time we've talked.

38:30.960 --> 38:34.720
Um, so obviously people know that I've, I've seen your stuff.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.120
I know that your numbers are real.

38:36.120 --> 38:38.240
You're not a, you're not a snake in the grass.

38:38.240 --> 38:41.680
So anyway, what I would encourage you guys to do, if you just hopped on, go and

38:41.720 --> 38:42.280
watch this.

38:42.280 --> 38:46.560
As soon as we hop off, this thing will post to my, the community section on

38:46.560 --> 38:51.760
YouTube and, uh, you guys go watch this from the beginning and go check out Zach's

38:51.760 --> 38:58.400
website, zachpal.co we've had quite a few people, um, inside of who's misunderstood.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.360
It says, hi, misunderstood.

39:00.560 --> 39:03.440
Uh, you missed us, but this is going to be live here in just a second.

39:03.680 --> 39:04.560
Um, go check it out.

39:04.560 --> 39:05.640
Go check out Zach's site.

39:05.640 --> 39:09.160
He, I've seen him take, and I've, I've talked to these people personally.

39:09.160 --> 39:12.760
I've seen him take a handful of people to 10, 20.

39:12.840 --> 39:14.440
There's one of the people that you train.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.840
That's like, like, like at your heels, like almost to pass you.

39:17.840 --> 39:18.320
Right.

39:20.200 --> 39:20.640
Yeah.

39:20.720 --> 39:20.960
Yeah.

39:20.960 --> 39:24.200
52,000 monthly career revenue.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.240
He's like, I'm going to catch you.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.320
I'm like sick, dude.

39:27.800 --> 39:31.560
It's like, there's the Jedi, the apprentice and boom, you're going to,

39:32.480 --> 39:36.840
bro, it's like, uh, inside of digital lines, we have Ryan Dalton.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.920
He's at like 87,000 a month.

39:39.480 --> 39:44.080
And I'm like, dude, this dude's coming at for me, but it's the best.

39:44.120 --> 39:47.640
It's like the best compliment in the world that somebody that you train

39:48.040 --> 39:50.880
passes you, but, uh, it still gives you a little fire.

39:50.880 --> 39:53.800
Like, dude, no, no, no, I want to be at the top guy, you know?

39:55.160 --> 40:00.120
So, but, um, so yeah, guys, I'm going to link up Zach stuff.

40:00.160 --> 40:02.400
Um, I'll get his socials and everything.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.480
But yeah, check out his website, Zach pal.co.

40:05.160 --> 40:09.720
He started just like you guys had a JLB wanted to have freedom.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.240
And, uh, he's basically living the, the Tim Ferris life, going to

40:13.240 --> 40:15.280
Nicaragua, going to Hawaii.

40:15.720 --> 40:15.960
Yeah.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.120
They just built him and his wife.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.480
He wouldn't tell you guys this, but he just built a new house.

40:19.800 --> 40:23.200
Um, all this is since we met and since he started doing this.

40:23.200 --> 40:26.040
Cause I think when we met, dude, you were making like six, I think you

40:26.040 --> 40:30.960
had started the business, but you were making like sub 10 K and now you're,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
it's like your entire life has changed, dude.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.040
It's crazy thinking how much your life could change in a

40:35.040 --> 40:36.040
couple of years, you know?

40:38.080 --> 40:38.320
Yeah.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.360
It's mind boggling looking at that timeline.

40:41.000 --> 40:41.280
Yeah.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.480
Um, a lot can change quick, man.

40:43.480 --> 40:47.240
If you just commit daily consistency, you guys will get there.

40:47.240 --> 40:49.040
So let me ask you one more question.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.440
This is the last thing I'm going to ask you.

40:50.440 --> 40:54.520
How did you get, what did, did your wife believe in what you were

40:54.520 --> 40:56.360
doing when you first started?

40:56.360 --> 40:59.920
And if so, how did you get her to, if not, how did you get her to it?

40:59.920 --> 41:03.880
This is something I hear all the time is like, you know, in a lot of times

41:03.880 --> 41:06.600
people have their spouse that doesn't believe in them because they have a

41:06.600 --> 41:10.000
previous mess up where maybe they decided they're going to do something

41:10.000 --> 41:14.840
and they completely flop, but how, how was your wife's support and how did

41:14.840 --> 41:16.080
you get her on board with you?

41:16.440 --> 41:19.080
Cause I'm of course now she's proud of you.

41:19.080 --> 41:23.080
She's like, yeah, my husband's the man because like she, he's going to take

41:23.080 --> 41:26.280
care of us, we have a great lifestyle and all this stuff, this brand new house.

41:26.280 --> 41:28.240
But when you started, was that the case?

41:30.360 --> 41:31.640
That is a great question.

41:31.640 --> 41:39.320
Um, I think it's just like any relationship where trust builds over time.

41:39.800 --> 41:45.080
And so ever since we got married, before we were married, my wife

41:45.080 --> 41:47.280
saw my consistent effort.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.760
We were dating when I was doing sales, selling direct TV, and she saw me put

41:51.760 --> 41:58.680
in the work, put in the work, put in the work, and then it was a long time.

41:58.760 --> 42:00.600
And there was this big investment, right?

42:00.640 --> 42:02.640
To invest in a course.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.160
I'd never bought a course before.

42:04.160 --> 42:05.400
I never bought a group before.

42:05.600 --> 42:08.960
It was a lot of money when you're making only 4,600 bucks a month, right?

42:09.200 --> 42:11.360
I'm like, dude, I'm going to invest in this.

42:11.360 --> 42:13.720
I better, I better make this work.

42:14.200 --> 42:18.400
And my wife was like, you're about to drop thousands of dollars on this.

42:19.080 --> 42:19.920
Are you serious?

42:20.480 --> 42:26.600
And I was like, yes, I absolutely am going to, and it's going to be the best

42:26.640 --> 42:27.680
decision we ever made.

42:27.680 --> 42:33.600
I was so set because my mindset was, it wasn't, oh, I'm going to buy this

42:33.600 --> 42:35.800
thing because I have some savings and give it a go.

42:35.800 --> 42:38.360
It was like, I am going to do this.

42:38.840 --> 42:43.120
I am committed and I will gain my freedom.

42:43.520 --> 42:44.680
This will happen.

42:44.920 --> 42:48.480
And so when I explained it in that way, I was like, babe, look,

42:49.280 --> 42:50.640
people are doing this.

42:50.960 --> 42:55.360
Other people have made this possible and I can hustle in that way.

42:55.640 --> 42:57.240
I can hustle in that same way.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.320
They're not any smarter than me.

42:59.840 --> 43:03.360
Um, I can figure this out and I'm going to grind.

43:03.400 --> 43:06.480
If it takes, I was committed for multiple years.

43:06.480 --> 43:09.760
I was like, if I have to grind and I don't make money doing this for one

43:09.760 --> 43:12.120
year or two years, that's okay.

43:12.120 --> 43:18.800
I'm committed for the long haul because I have this vision of in five years, I'm

43:18.800 --> 43:22.360
going to own a business like these other people, but I could see their timelines

43:22.400 --> 43:26.520
and I could see people who were doing this in a year, two years.

43:26.520 --> 43:31.840
And I was, okay, I'm going to commit for two years and see where I'm at.

43:31.840 --> 43:34.240
I'm just going to grind, push every day, push every day.

43:34.680 --> 43:37.920
And so when she saw that commitment, she was like, okay, we've never spent

43:38.720 --> 43:44.280
this many thousands of dollars on anything, but like you have my trust

43:44.920 --> 43:46.480
and you're going to do this.

43:46.480 --> 43:47.200
It's going to be great.

43:47.440 --> 43:50.720
So she gave me the green light and I'm like, so grateful that she did, you know,

43:50.720 --> 43:51.320
she's a nurse.

43:51.320 --> 43:55.960
And so she basically had all of our savings and was investing it in me,

43:56.240 --> 43:59.640
which was an honor, but also like a responsibility.

44:00.080 --> 44:07.800
So, um, that mindset going in to just be like, I'm going to make this work.

44:08.640 --> 44:11.880
Um, I think it's kind of what you want to have.

44:12.720 --> 44:16.440
Um, and that's how, like, if you're not, I guess on the other side, if you're,

44:16.440 --> 44:18.880
if you're thinking right now, like, Oh, I'm not consistent.

44:18.920 --> 44:20.400
I've said things and I don't do them.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.520
Like that's okay.

44:23.360 --> 44:25.320
The past is irrelevant.

44:25.360 --> 44:29.480
All that we care about is now and each day moving forward.

44:29.760 --> 44:35.320
So build the self-confidence in yourself day by day with those little decisions.

44:35.640 --> 44:37.440
What are you going to commit to today?

44:38.200 --> 44:40.960
Are you going to commit to waking up at a certain time?

44:41.280 --> 44:42.440
Like start doing that thing.

44:42.720 --> 44:48.160
Are you going to commit to go work out for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes a

44:48.160 --> 44:50.600
day, what level are you willing to commit to?

44:50.880 --> 44:54.680
And if you do it every single day, you'll build that trust in yourself.

44:55.240 --> 44:59.040
But the people around you, your wife, your spouse, they'll start seeing that

44:59.040 --> 45:01.400
and they'll trust you more.

45:01.640 --> 45:03.080
And they'll be like, he keeps his word.

45:03.400 --> 45:04.640
He keeps his word to himself.

45:04.640 --> 45:06.440
He keeps his word to his family.

45:06.600 --> 45:11.320
I trust him with this big investment because he is consistent in all these

45:11.320 --> 45:14.280
other areas, of course, he's going to be consistent in this too.

45:14.720 --> 45:15.840
So I think it's just like a muscle.

45:15.840 --> 45:17.360
If you feel like, Oh, I'm not consistent.

45:17.360 --> 45:18.320
I don't trust myself.

45:18.600 --> 45:19.960
Like you got to build that.

45:19.960 --> 45:23.600
Start where you're at and just like little by little, boom, keep stacking

45:23.600 --> 45:24.880
wins, keep stacking wins.

45:25.320 --> 45:30.120
And once you're consistent with one thing, add another until now you're unstoppable

45:30.360 --> 45:33.920
and you're just able to achieve everything that you want to super quickly.

45:34.480 --> 45:37.200
So that's kind of my thought on that is build the trust.

45:37.200 --> 45:40.840
If you don't have it work today on just building that little trust, you'll

45:40.840 --> 45:43.440
strengthen your relationship with your spouse, you'll strengthen your

45:43.440 --> 45:48.160
confidence in yourself and you'll get your results step by step, brick by

45:48.160 --> 45:50.080
brick building over time.

45:51.160 --> 45:52.040
Oh yeah.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.000
I mean, dude, I had the same thing.

45:54.000 --> 46:00.800
Like I was doing door to door and I proved myself, you know, and my wife was

46:00.800 --> 46:02.720
like, yeah, okay, this guy knows what he's doing.

46:02.720 --> 46:06.280
Like, and so then when I made my next decision, which was to start a software

46:06.280 --> 46:08.720
company, I didn't even have to ask her.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.120
But then of course that failed and it kind of lost her trust.

46:12.120 --> 46:16.120
So then I was back on like, you have to continually make sure that people

46:16.120 --> 46:17.800
around you know that you're going to take care of them.

46:17.800 --> 46:22.920
It's like this big thing, especially I feel like with, uh, with, uh, oh shoot.

46:22.920 --> 46:23.720
Can you still hear me?

46:23.800 --> 46:24.240
Oh, there we go.

46:24.240 --> 46:24.880
You're still good.

46:26.920 --> 46:27.160
Okay.

46:27.160 --> 46:29.280
My internet shake anyway.

46:29.320 --> 46:34.120
Um, but then guys, the point being is that if you guys are having an issue

46:34.120 --> 46:37.880
with your spouse or with your significant other, like having that belief in you,

46:37.880 --> 46:41.240
it's probably because you don't, you've never given them a reason to trust you.

46:41.600 --> 46:45.480
And so for me, when I got into this business, ultimately, like I had made a

46:45.480 --> 46:46.160
mistake or two.

46:46.160 --> 46:47.680
I had lost money in the stock market.

46:47.680 --> 46:50.880
I w you know, I lost like $50,000 on a stock.

46:50.880 --> 46:52.840
I didn't really properly check out.

46:53.160 --> 46:59.120
And so I had to just make the, like, I, I tried to get her blessing and she's

46:59.120 --> 47:01.200
like, basically it was like, no.

47:01.400 --> 47:05.160
And I had to make, I had to, I had to just make the, uh, the presidential

47:05.160 --> 47:09.160
decision that even though it was a no, I had to, I still had to do it.

47:09.160 --> 47:14.320
So I went ahead without her permission with the mentality, like I have to make

47:14.320 --> 47:18.160
this work or I'm going to be toast for my entire relationship.

47:18.160 --> 47:20.720
So, um, and that's exactly what I did.

47:20.720 --> 47:24.280
And we had a little day or two where she was upset, but I was like, look, I'm

47:24.280 --> 47:26.200
the one that's in charge of making money for this house.

47:26.440 --> 47:27.600
I'm going to make this work.

47:27.880 --> 47:34.520
And what, to your point, when you change your mentality from like, you know, I'm

47:34.520 --> 47:38.160
going to give it a couple months or whatever, and you're like, I am going to

47:38.160 --> 47:42.040
make this work because Zach Powell made it work, I can make it work, which

47:42.040 --> 47:44.680
means it's possible and I will do it 10 years.

47:44.680 --> 47:47.080
If it takes it, I'm not thinking about anything else.

47:47.080 --> 47:48.000
I'm just going to focus.

47:48.400 --> 47:49.520
You can make anything work.

47:49.520 --> 47:51.120
You can go make money in an MLM.

47:51.120 --> 47:54.680
You can make money selling fricking lotions and potions or door to door.

47:55.120 --> 47:56.920
It's just that you have to change the mentality.

47:56.920 --> 48:00.280
Like I'm going to do it until it works and remove all the distractions.

48:00.720 --> 48:02.320
Um, and you can make it work.

48:02.320 --> 48:05.920
So any of you guys that are hesitant about starting an SEO business, starting

48:05.920 --> 48:10.880
a Legion agency, doing digital real estate, you, you can make money in anything.

48:10.880 --> 48:13.680
You just have to do it long enough and you have to just say, I'm going to do it

48:13.720 --> 48:16.360
until and the, and it will work.

48:16.360 --> 48:16.840
It will work.

48:16.840 --> 48:17.560
It's that simple.

48:17.560 --> 48:22.240
So anyway, Zach Powell, I know it's like nine 15 to where you're at.

48:22.280 --> 48:24.440
It's eight to eight 13 in the morning, dude.

48:24.440 --> 48:26.040
Day's just getting started for me.
