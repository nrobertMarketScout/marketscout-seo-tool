1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What social media accounts do you create, like Facebook business page, Instagram page,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,520
Yelp, to increase your chance of getting a GMB as part of creating a new city niche account?

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,880
In other words, what are things you do to help improve Google acceptance?

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,920
Guys, I don't spend a bunch of time with GMB anymore, okay, because to me,

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,880
can you? Yes. Is it still possible? Yes. We actually recently got a GMB in the last two weeks,

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,880
trying some new strategies, but I have not found anything that's tried and true that I'm

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,760
confident saying, hey, here's the new strategy. What I've kind of opted to do instead is that

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,520
I am going to focus on getting better at ads and getting better at organic rankings faster,

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,400
okay, because guys, think about it like this. I've said this before, but you got to realize that

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,160
when we have with Google, right, you can get leads from paid ads, you can get leads from

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,600
the Google My Business or the local, and you can get leads from organic, and if you can get two of

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,880
those three, you're going to be just fine. Back in 2020, when I was just trying to figure things out

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,280
on more than half of my websites, or at least half of my websites, I didn't even have a GMB

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,200
because it didn't click to me. It didn't occur to me that I could use the business owner's address.

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,160
I didn't understand all this stuff, and so I was going along getting deals scaling up to $100,000

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,520
a month, not realizing that I even needed a GMB. You don't need a GMB. Now, if you can get one,

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,320
does it help? Sure, but even if I have them, I don't like to rely on them for leads because I

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,960
feel like they're always problems. You're falling off, you're doing this, you're getting suspended,

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,640
you're checking, checking, checking. So for me, I just decided, you know what, I'm going to focus

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,880
on getting better at the things that I know how to do, which is ads and organic, and if we can get

21
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,720
the GMB, great, if we can't, then whatever. However, I will tell you that yes, the Facebook

22
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,480
business page does help, the Yelp page does help, but me personally, I'm just focusing on,

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,520
I told you guys, I'm in simplification mode. I'm in, hey, these are the things I know that work,

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,240
so I'm going to focus on them, and so that's what I've tried to put my effort on. That doesn't

25
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,920
mean you can't, doesn't mean that's not a possibility, but that's where I'm putting my focus.
