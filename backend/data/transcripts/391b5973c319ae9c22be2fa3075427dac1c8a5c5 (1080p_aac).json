In fact, I think that that doing hard shit and being confident is the thing that makes you attractive it's not being attractive that makes you confident okay. It's not about driving a fancy car. It's not about being in, you know, prime shape, all these things help and all these things are things that I do because they add to it. If you're sitting there right now and you're at a four. If you're at a six if you're at not a 10. The number one thing that you can do to build confidence is consistently do hard shit. That's going to move the needle that you know you need to do when you said you were going to do it and again, defining the hard shit as those things that you know you need to do that the things that need to be done to move the needle.
