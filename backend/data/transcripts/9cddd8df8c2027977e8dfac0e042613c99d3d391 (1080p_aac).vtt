00:00.000 --> 00:14.200
Thinking like Uncle G aka Google. As I've said before in a previous video, the more that

00:14.200 --> 00:18.800
we can put ourselves in Google's shoes, the more we can understand what benefits them

00:18.800 --> 00:25.360
and what they're trying to accomplish, the better job we can do at SEO. So I want to

00:25.360 --> 00:28.760
have you guys just think about something really quick and maybe it's something you've asked

00:28.760 --> 00:32.240
yourself before. Maybe it's not. But I want you to ask yourself this question. It's a

00:32.240 --> 00:38.120
rhetorical question. How does Google actually make money? We see them all over. We know

00:38.120 --> 00:42.320
they're worth billions and billions of dollars. They might even be worth a trillion at this

00:42.320 --> 00:47.760
point. I don't even know. They make phones. I mean, it's such a big company. It's such

00:47.760 --> 00:53.600
a popular thing that it's a verb now. Like, did you Google it? It's actually a verb. But

00:53.600 --> 00:57.840
how do they make money? What is their main revenue source? Well, I'm going to give you

00:57.840 --> 01:03.000
the answer, and that is through this little thing called AdWords, which all of us are

01:03.000 --> 01:07.120
familiar with because we've all dealt with it. We've all spent money on it. We've all

01:07.120 --> 01:14.280
used it and abused it, et cetera. And so the reason I'm bringing that up is you then need

01:14.280 --> 01:19.760
to ask yourself, okay, well, how does AdWords work? Why does AdWords work? Well, AdWords

01:19.760 --> 01:26.280
works because so many people go to Google. They have so many searches that they can charge

01:26.280 --> 01:32.600
for it. Well, why do they have so many searches? Okay, we're just going down the rabbit hole,

01:32.600 --> 01:36.200
but think about it. If you have a question, if you're looking for concrete, if you're

01:36.200 --> 01:40.080
looking to extend your pool deck or you're looking to put in a sidewalk or you're looking

01:40.080 --> 01:45.080
to pour a pad for your basketball hoop for your kid or whatever, right, what are you

01:45.080 --> 01:49.880
going to do? You're going to go to Google and you're going to search concrete contractors

01:49.880 --> 01:54.360
near me or concrete contractors Las Vegas, Nevada or concrete contractors St. George,

01:55.320 --> 02:03.840
right? Why? Because in the past, every time you've searched anything, Google has given

02:03.840 --> 02:09.640
you results that are very, very accurate and they almost know exactly what you're looking

02:09.640 --> 02:14.800
for. And we have gotten so accustomed to, if we have a question, we don't even need

02:14.800 --> 02:20.640
to really type it in correctly. We can honestly just type in a part of a lyric or somebody's

02:20.720 --> 02:26.200
name that's spelled incorrectly or somebody is famous plus their husband and it will pull

02:26.200 --> 02:33.200
it up. Their search engine is so good and is so accurate that we have relied on Google

02:33.560 --> 02:40.360
to answer all of our questions. But for Google to keep charging exorbitant amounts of money

02:40.360 --> 02:46.680
like they do for AdWords, that has to stay true. What does all this mean, Nick? What

02:46.680 --> 02:53.680
this means is Google needs us as customers to trust them. And so they need to put the

02:54.520 --> 02:59.160
top, the people that they put at the top of Google in the maps, in the organic and even

02:59.160 --> 03:06.160
in the ads, they have to be relevant to what people are looking for, aka they need to get

03:06.900 --> 03:12.040
their questions answered. Okay? So what I just need you to wrap your head around is

03:12.040 --> 03:17.000
as you're doing SEO, as you're doing content, as you're doing your ads, as you're doing

03:17.000 --> 03:21.480
everything related to Google, keep in mind how Google makes money. And think about it

03:21.480 --> 03:28.000
as you go to put something on your website, ask yourself is this related to somebody that's

03:28.000 --> 03:33.280
searching for concrete contractors? Would they also search this thing? Somebody that's searching

03:33.280 --> 03:40.280
concrete contractors is probably also searching for how much does concrete cost? Can you pour

03:40.640 --> 03:47.640
concrete in the cold? Top rated concrete contractors near me, concrete company, right? And there's

03:49.560 --> 03:54.960
all these different things that are related to it. So let's use another example, right?

03:54.960 --> 03:58.840
People that are searching for Kanye West, and I'm using him because right now he's getting

03:58.840 --> 04:04.560
blown up in the media, so it's on top of everybody's minds, okay? If you're, somebody or you that's

04:04.560 --> 04:09.280
searching for Kanye West is also probably searching for other things, right? They might

04:09.280 --> 04:14.680
be searching for Kanye's net worth. They might be searching for Yeezy's. They might be searching

04:14.680 --> 04:21.680
for Kim, right? They might be searching for some crazy comment that he made. And so the

04:23.280 --> 04:27.440
companies that understand this, the companies that write the blog articles and the regular

04:27.440 --> 04:34.440
articles and the pages that talk about all of those things that are the most authoritative

04:34.640 --> 04:38.960
around that subject matter are the ones that are going to win. So when we're doing sites

04:38.960 --> 04:41.960
and we're doing content and we're doing our on page SEO, which we're going to get into

04:41.960 --> 04:48.360
all that, I just need your frame of mind realizing that we need to be the most authoritative.

04:48.360 --> 04:52.120
We need to be all encompassing. If we're talking about concrete contractors, we also need to

04:52.120 --> 04:56.040
be talking about concrete companies. We also need to be talking about concrete cost. That's

04:56.040 --> 05:00.440
why we do the keyword list so thoroughly. And there are some things we don't care about

05:00.440 --> 05:04.460
ranking for, right? We don't care about cheap concrete near me because those are not customers

05:04.460 --> 05:10.060
that we want. But I just want you guys, as you're going through this, if you can drill

05:10.060 --> 05:14.440
this into your head and every time you're about to put something on your page or choose

05:14.440 --> 05:18.400
an anchor text, which all these terms I'm going to get into. If you don't know what

05:18.400 --> 05:24.060
somebody is talking about, it's coming. But I'm just giving you a little precursor. Just

05:24.060 --> 05:30.660
think like Google. Think like Uncle G and for them to continue to charge for ads, which

05:30.700 --> 05:35.660
is their main revenue stream, they have to continue to be trusted. And the way that they

05:35.660 --> 05:41.660
are trusted is because when you search something, they put results at the top that answer your

05:41.660 --> 05:48.660
questions.
