00:00.000 --> 00:14.600
Guys, before we go any further and before we get, you know, jump into this, get started,

00:14.600 --> 00:20.920
I want to explain to you and stress the importance of the fact that the money is actually made

00:20.920 --> 00:24.480
in picking the city and the niche combination.

00:24.480 --> 00:27.240
And I really, really mean that it's super, super important.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.840
And so I'm going to use an example from physical real estate.

00:29.840 --> 00:35.680
The reason I like to use examples from physical real estate is because we are doing the exact

00:35.680 --> 00:39.360
same thing, but doing it digitally or doing it online.

00:39.360 --> 00:42.440
We want to become digital landlords.

00:42.440 --> 00:47.720
So there's a saying in physical real estate, and they always say this, okay, and by they

00:47.720 --> 00:52.680
I'm talking about the books, the experts, the gurus, the investors, and they always

00:52.680 --> 00:59.080
say the money is made in the buy, not in the sell, okay?

00:59.080 --> 01:00.080
What does that mean?

01:00.080 --> 01:05.240
It means that if you're going to go purchase a, let's call it a duplex or a single family

01:05.240 --> 01:07.960
home for $200,000, okay?

01:07.960 --> 01:14.600
If you go and you buy a property, a duplex, let's say, that's worth $200,000, but you

01:14.600 --> 01:21.200
purchase it for $160,000, you immediately are going to win.

01:21.200 --> 01:26.240
Even if you turn around and you sell it for market value or below market value, you're

01:26.240 --> 01:30.500
going to win because you immediately got $40,000 of equity, right?

01:30.500 --> 01:33.720
You bought it for $160,000, it's worth $200,000.

01:33.720 --> 01:39.600
You're going to win no matter what, and likewise, with digital real estate, if you pick the

01:39.600 --> 01:46.160
right city and the right niche combination, you are almost guaranteed success, okay?

01:46.160 --> 01:50.920
So there's a couple of reasons why this is super, super, super important.

01:50.920 --> 01:56.200
All right, reason number one, by choosing the right city and the right niche, you are

01:56.200 --> 02:02.360
going to be able to avoid very competitive, heavy SEO.

02:02.360 --> 02:06.320
Nothing gets more tiring, nothing burns you out quicker, nothing is more frustrating than

02:06.320 --> 02:12.480
just chugging along and doing backlinks and content and this and that and the rest.

02:12.480 --> 02:17.600
It's very, very frustrating, and especially when you know you could put the same amount

02:17.600 --> 02:23.040
of time into another niche and city combination and yield much higher results.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.500
You could get ranked much quicker.

02:24.540 --> 02:30.740
Number two is by not having to do heavy SEO, it's going to allow you to rank your site

02:30.740 --> 02:36.140
quicker, and the quicker you can rank your website, the less money you're going to have

02:36.140 --> 02:39.420
to spend on ads, the less money you're going to have to spend on ads, the more money you're

02:39.420 --> 02:42.940
going to put in your pocket, and I think, at least me, the reason I'm here is I'm trying

02:42.940 --> 02:43.940
to make money.

02:43.940 --> 02:51.020
All right, number three is by picking the right city and niche combination, you are

02:51.100 --> 02:57.420
going to be able to find areas where your cost per click on Google Ads, and we're going

02:57.420 --> 03:01.340
to get into this, don't stress it, don't freak out if you don't know what that means, and

03:01.340 --> 03:04.300
that's called CPC, but this is very, very simple stuff.

03:04.300 --> 03:08.060
I'm not going to go into it right this moment, but you're going to be able to find cities

03:08.060 --> 03:15.820
and niches where the cost per click is very inexpensive, and what that means is if it's

03:15.980 --> 03:23.500
inexpensive for you, it's going to allow you to get more leads, in theory, for less money

03:23.500 --> 03:29.340
out of your pocket, which means the business owner is going to get more leads by you spending

03:29.340 --> 03:33.900
less money, which means they're going to be happier, and you're going to be able to retain

03:33.900 --> 03:35.460
them longer.

03:35.460 --> 03:40.780
So a huge benefit of picking the right city and the right niche combination is you're

03:40.780 --> 03:46.060
going to be able to find those combos where you're going to find inexpensive ads, and

03:46.060 --> 03:48.060
that is going to make all the difference in the world.

03:48.060 --> 03:52.220
Trust me, and I have done this correctly, and I've done this incorrectly, and when you

03:52.220 --> 03:55.980
do this correctly, it is night and day difference, okay?

03:55.980 --> 04:00.620
Lastly, by doing this correctly, and it kind of goes back to what I said in the beginning,

04:00.620 --> 04:04.300
doing this correctly almost guarantees your success.

04:04.300 --> 04:09.740
If you can pick a city and you can pick a niche where there's low competition, there's

04:09.740 --> 04:15.660
good search volume, meaning people are looking for that service, there's low cost per click,

04:15.660 --> 04:21.100
means inexpensive advertising, and there's people that are willing to pay for your advertising,

04:21.100 --> 04:26.780
say willing to pay for your leads, let me say it that way, you are almost guaranteed success.

04:26.780 --> 04:30.940
Now, obviously, you have to put in the work because I can't do it for you, but these are

04:30.940 --> 04:34.940
going to eliminate all the pitfalls that most people run into, okay?

04:34.940 --> 04:40.540
And I will tell you this, I have done this incorrectly, and when I first got into rank

04:40.540 --> 04:46.140
and rent, I took a couple of programs, and these programs, they told me how to pick my

04:46.140 --> 04:52.220
city and niche, and maybe at the time that was more up to date, maybe I didn't listen

04:52.220 --> 04:57.740
100% correctly, but I do a pretty good job of doing that, of actually paying attention

04:57.740 --> 05:02.780
and doing stuff exactly, and I did it the way they taught, and I'll tell you that about

05:02.780 --> 05:07.740
four weeks ago from the time of recording right this moment, I went through and audited

05:07.740 --> 05:16.060
all my sites, and I went and I got rid of 125, 125, 125 of my websites that I built years

05:16.060 --> 05:23.740
and years and years ago, that it's going to take me months, if not years, of just solid,

05:23.740 --> 05:28.540
heavy SEO to even consider getting ranked. On top of that, my advertising is going to

05:28.540 --> 05:35.260
be expensive, and for me, it just wasn't worth the squeeze, okay? So, from somebody who's

05:35.260 --> 05:40.220
made the mistakes, do not make the same mistake, do not make the same mistake, take your time,

05:40.220 --> 05:45.180
I don't care if you need to look at 100 city and niche combinations to pick one, I do not

05:45.180 --> 05:49.340
care, it is worth your time, because if you can pick these winners, if you can pick these,

05:49.340 --> 05:54.540
what I call layups, it's going to make everything easier, okay? And I'm going to show you an

05:54.540 --> 06:01.020
example of a project I did, this has been a couple of years ago, and this thing has made me

06:01.020 --> 06:05.820
an incredible amount of money, I put very little work into it, and it continues to produce over

06:05.820 --> 06:11.260
and over and over. Okay, so guys, the project that I did, it was in a city called Bentonville,

06:11.260 --> 06:17.420
Arkansas, and this is a city where it's the headquarters of Walmart, but what's interesting

06:17.420 --> 06:22.380
is this only has a population of 52,000, and we're going to get into the population metrics

06:22.380 --> 06:26.220
and all that kind of stuff and why it doesn't really matter, but it doesn't have a ton of

06:26.220 --> 06:30.380
people that actually live there compared to other cities, right? So anyway, I just wanted

06:30.380 --> 06:37.500
to point that out, but I went in and I built a project in a city called Bentonville for concrete,

06:37.500 --> 06:43.340
okay? And as you can see, I am ranked number one for this term, at least, right? I'm not

06:43.340 --> 06:47.740
probably not ranked for every term, but pretty dang close to it. I'm ranked number one here,

06:47.740 --> 06:54.220
I'm also the number one in the maps, and you can see there's so few competition in this,

06:54.220 --> 06:59.980
there's so few competitors, sorry, that I'm the only one ranking, okay? And so this is what's

06:59.980 --> 07:05.420
crazy is if you look at this website, it's a very, very simple website, but if you actually look at

07:05.420 --> 07:09.660
the backlink profile, you look at the content, you look at what actually went into this, this

07:09.660 --> 07:16.460
isn't that impressive of a website. And what I'm trying to show you, if you do this correctly,

07:16.460 --> 07:23.820
you can skip a lot of the other work, and you can make a ton of money. And from this website

07:23.820 --> 07:32.060
alone, I have made over $20,000 over the past couple of years with the same exact client

07:32.060 --> 07:41.420
paying me every single week on auto pay. So guys, I'm telling you right now, do not, I repeat,

07:41.500 --> 07:47.980
do not breeze through this, skip through this, rush through this. This is so crucial that we

07:47.980 --> 07:52.300
get this piece right, because it's gonna make all the difference in the world between being profitable

07:52.300 --> 07:55.340
and wanting to bash your head through a wall.
