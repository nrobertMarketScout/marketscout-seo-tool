00:00.000 --> 00:01.760
I say exclusivity agreement as well,

00:01.760 --> 00:02.600
and I explain what it means.

00:02.600 --> 00:04.560
If they say they don't do contracts, I call BS.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.060
We have credit cards.

00:06.060 --> 00:07.360
We hand credit cards to teenagers

00:07.360 --> 00:08.960
in drive throws all the time.

00:08.960 --> 00:10.640
The exclusivity agreement is for the protection of the BO.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.440
Yeah. Good point, Mahmood.

00:12.440 --> 00:13.280
It is true.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.280
You don't need to call it a contract.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.680
Call it an exclusivity agreement.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.520
If they say, hey, can I cancel?

00:17.520 --> 00:19.760
Then you can say, no.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.320
You can say however you want, but no, obviously not.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.120
But if you want to find somebody to replace you

00:24.120 --> 00:25.440
for the rest of those months, you can.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.400
But no, we don't do that.

00:26.400 --> 00:27.660
You know, that kind of a thing.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.060
But guys, just be confident.

00:29.060 --> 00:30.820
When you say something, be confident,

00:30.820 --> 00:33.320
and they'll be confident if you're timid.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.220
Well, yeah, there is, but then it's not gonna work.

00:36.220 --> 00:37.060
Okay?

00:37.060 --> 00:37.900
Call it an exclusivity agreement.

00:37.900 --> 00:38.740
Call it a contract.

00:38.740 --> 00:39.660
Nobody cares.

00:39.660 --> 00:42.100
Just be confident with what you say.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.540
Got it? Francesca, you got it?

00:44.540 --> 00:45.360
I got it.
