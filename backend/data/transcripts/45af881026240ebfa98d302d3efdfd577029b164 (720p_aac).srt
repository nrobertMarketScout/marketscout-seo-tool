1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,280
Guys, let me know if you can hear me in the chat, please.

2
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,760
I don't see anybody on, but let's go ahead and just wait a second here, see if I'm actually

3
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
live.

4
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,680
Okay, we've got one person on.

5
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,680
Maybe that's me.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,880
I'm going to wait a second.

7
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,960
My chat, Facebook's terrible.

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,160
I can't even see who's on.

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,240
It's awesome.

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,160
If you can see me, hear me, please comment below, okay?

11
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,160
In the comments.

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,160
I'm going to be quick on this.

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
I'd like to have a few people on live.

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,080
If not, I'll just go anyway, but let's go ahead and see.

15
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,480
I'm going to wait one, two minutes and I'm going to hop on.

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,080
Can you hear me?

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Let me know in the chat.

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,440
If you can, make a comment, make an emoji, do something, but I just want to, just real

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,400
quick, I'm going to be five, 10, 15 minutes.

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,280
If you're lucky, it's going to be much less than that, okay?

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,800
Can you hear me?

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,720
Okay, see a few people on.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
Beautiful.

24
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
All right.

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,880
Unfortunately, I can't see your comments come in real time, but I do see some comments

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,880
that keep refreshing.

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,240
Kevin, what's up, dude?

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,800
Nicholas Kudlick, what's up?

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,560
Kevin says, what's up, homie Nick?

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
What's going on?

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Laura Shepard can hear me.

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
Guys, welcome to the call.

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,640
This is going to be a quick little live.

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,040
I hadn't even planned on doing this.

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,760
I had planned on doing something else, but I just want to say something as a follow-up.

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,560
Jason Allred, what's up, dude?

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,680
Guys, it is, what is today, March 19th.

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,800
For me, it's almost 5 p.m., it's 4.48.

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,960
We're almost done with quarter one, which is pretty wild, pretty exciting, also scary

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,200
if you're not doing anything with your business or your life, but guys, I was thinking about

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,240
this the other day and I've been thinking about it and I want you guys to really put

42
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,320
yourself in this frame of thought and then also I'm going to tell you why I'm bringing

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:35,280
this up to you right now, but imagine if the deal structure that you had, imagine if there

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,680
was no flat fee, if there was no paper lead, if there was no commission, if there was no

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,320
joint venture.

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:49,360
Imagine that the only way you got paid as a marketer, as a lead generator, as somebody

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,160
who owns a lead generation agency, imagine if the only way that you got paid was if

48
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,280
and when your customer made money.

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,920
Not when they got the lead, not at the first of the month, not on the 15th of the month,

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:12,040
not every week, only when your clients made money.

51
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,640
If that was the case, how differently would you attack it?

52
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,320
How differently would you treat the relationship with your business owner?

53
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:28,560
How differently would you be in your selection of the people that you choose to work with?

54
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,120
It would be radically different.

55
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,200
For me, if I think about that, it would be radically, radically different.

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,400
What would you expect out of your business owner?

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,280
Would you tolerate your business owner not answering the phone?

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,140
Would you tolerate your business owner or even think about working with somebody that

59
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,920
didn't show up to the Zoom meeting or show up or respond back to a phone call or treated

60
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,960
a customer like, crap, would you do that?

61
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,360
No, because the only way that you would be getting paid is if they made money and so

62
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,480
you would hold them to a certain expectation.

63
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,920
Guys, the reason I'm bringing this up is this is kind of going back to last week's live

64
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
that I did.

65
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,480
If you guys didn't see it, go check it out, guys.

66
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
Last week I went live.

67
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,840
I can't even remember what I called it.

68
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,920
I think I called it Porter's step-by-step guided 10th, 11,700, whatever it was.

69
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,080
Basically, I just went on a rant about what the heck are you guys doing?

70
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,280
Why is no one making money?

71
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,920
Why is no one doing anything?

72
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,960
And thank goodness from that I saw a bunch of people make posts.

73
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,060
They are doing stuff.

74
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,640
For some reason people just don't want to talk about it.

75
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
By the way, thank you.

76
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
Shout out to AJ.

77
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Shout out to Gina.

78
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
Shout out to Vaughn.

79
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Shout out to Porter.

80
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,560
Shout out to all these people that are actually posting their deals and doing stuff.

81
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,360
The point is, guys, is that basically, well, not basically, going off of that live that

82
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,200
I did, I'm sitting here and I'm not thinking about this as much with my rank and rent clients.

83
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,320
I'm not thinking about this as much as my agency.

84
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,640
But I'm thinking about that with you guys is I'm sitting here going, sometimes I let

85
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,080
you guys come in here and, of course, you guys pay to be here.

86
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Thank you.

87
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
I appreciate you putting your trust in me.

88
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,000
I appreciate you giving me your hard-earned cash.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And I will not disappoint you.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I will show up.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I will be here.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't care if I have to miss something.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,440
Tonight I've got to get on an 11 o'clock thing because of the time zone.

94
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
I chose to be here.

95
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,600
That's part of the game.

96
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,120
I will deliver.

97
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,240
But then once I let you guys in, I haven't been that good about holding you accountable.

98
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,120
I haven't been that good about sticking it to you guys.

99
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,880
And I think part of the reason is because I'm like, well, they paid and it's really

100
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,080
their decision if they want to make money.

101
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,400
And I'm just tired of that, right?

102
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm super, super tired of that.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,580
And I want to start treating you guys as if I don't get paid until you make money.

104
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:42,040
And maybe I'm going to start charging that once you get in for the first five deals,

105
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,880
I don't know, maybe we'll start restructuring the payment.

106
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,680
You're going to pay the same amount to get in, then you're going to give me a percentage

107
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,840
of the, I don't know, well, I don't know.

108
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
Maybe not.

109
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Maybe probably not.

110
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Okay.

111
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
But I don't know.

112
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:02,080
But I'm just, I just want you guys to hear me and hear my enthusiasm and also my frustration

113
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,080
that I'm guys, we're adults.

114
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
We're adults.

115
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,320
I've read every one of you that's on here right now, every single person that's commented.

116
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Thank you.

117
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
I read your application.

118
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,360
I probably got on your call.

119
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,400
I saw the pain that you were going through, the reason why you're in this group, the reason

120
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,400
why you want to become financially free, the reason why you want to make money renting

121
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,000
out simple websites so you can stop letting your kids down, so you could take care of

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,160
your mom, so you can stop having regret and you're not going to wake up one day and have

123
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,480
a bunch of things that you wish you would have done.

124
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
You told me all these things.

125
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh, I just have to make a change.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,760
I can't be under someone's thumb and I'm tired of the nine to five and blah, blah, blah.

127
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,400
What are you doing about it though?

128
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
What are you doing?

129
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,120
I know some of you guys that heard my other live here are like, oh, here he goes again,

130
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,920
but guys, what have you done in the last week and a day?

131
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,160
What have you done in the last eight days since I came on here and tried to blast everyone

132
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,440
and said, what have you guys done?

133
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,640
How many times do you have to be reminded?

134
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,360
If you guys didn't see that, please go watch it.

135
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,880
I'm talking to grown ass adults and I swore I wasn't going to curse, but I'm talking to

136
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,000
grown ass adults here.

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,240
You guys aren't kids.

138
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,560
You're not in high school.

139
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,060
You're not forced to be here.

140
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,120
You guys paid to be in this group.

141
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,600
You guys forget that?

142
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,600
You paid me money to be in this group and now you're not doing shit with it.

143
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,920
What have you done?

144
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,200
What have you done in the last week?

145
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
I want to know.

146
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,640
I want to know somebody that's brave enough.

147
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,760
Tell me what you've done in the last eight days to make money.

148
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,440
It doesn't include dicking around on Weebly and doing this.

149
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,880
I'm talking about how many people have you asked for money?

150
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,480
Last week, Porter asked somebody for money Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

151
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Saturday.

152
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,640
He asked people for money six days of the week.

153
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,240
No wonder he's at $11,700.

154
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,880
Francesca, if you guys didn't know this, was it last Thursday?

155
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,160
I can't remember.

156
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
No.

157
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Sorry.

158
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Monday, she got on a call.

159
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,560
She lost the deal.

160
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
She lost.

161
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
Tuesday, she got another call.

162
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,120
That one went sideways.

163
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,080
Yesterday afternoon, she got on another one and got the deal.

164
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,080
It's little wonder that she's landed deals three of the last four weeks and she will

165
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,880
land another one this week because I will make sure that she does.

166
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
What are you doing?

167
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,400
This is a rhetorical question, but I also would love for somebody to be brave enough

168
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
to answer the question.

169
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,280
By the way, I can't see your comments, so whatever you're commenting, I'm going to try

170
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,620
to refresh it here in a second, but what are you doing?

171
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,960
What are you doing?

172
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,620
What are you doing with your business?

173
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,880
When is enough going to be enough?

174
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
When are you going to stop?

175
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,760
Are you going to really see how pathetic it is that you not only paid money to be in here,

176
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,120
but you're actually not doing anything?

177
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,280
You're actually not ... What I think I should start doing is when you come in, you pay the

178
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,920
money and you give me some ridiculously embarrassing piece of information that I can blackmail

179
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,200
you with, and if you don't hit your damn goals, I'm going to post it online.

180
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,120
Maybe that would be the thing, but guys, it's like every day I'm sitting here and I'm looking

181
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,640
at certain people that keep talking, I'm going to do it.

182
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,560
I saw a bunch of comments, oh, I got the kick in the pants from Nick.

183
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,040
Cool, what have you done?

184
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,960
What have you done?

185
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,400
I hope you understand, some of you guys are probably sitting there going, well, Nick,

186
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
what does it matter?

187
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
You've already gotten paid.

188
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
It means everything.

189
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,920
How do I keep growing this group?

190
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:29,280
How do I get feedback on what's working, what's not, if you guys aren't doing anything?

191
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,800
To be honest, I feel like I'm like my football coach back in high school when everyone just

192
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,080
wanted to grow their hair out and be cool and they didn't really want to hit the gym

193
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,080
and eat good and they cared way more about being cool than they did about actually winning

194
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
football games.

195
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,360
I was like, dude, this guy's psycho.

196
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,800
I'm the psycho now.

197
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Read the slide edge.

198
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,120
Read 10 pages of the slide edge every single day.

199
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,040
Do that and implement what it says in that book.

200
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,720
I gave you guys the book.

201
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,320
I know Porter's reading it because I'm following up with him.

202
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
I hit Kyle up today.

203
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,960
I said, Kyle, are you reading your book?

204
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Yes.

205
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Are you doing your sales training every day?

206
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Yes.

207
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Are you hitting the gym every day?

208
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Yes.

209
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Boom.

210
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Little wonder.

211
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
He's only lost three deals this entire month.

212
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,440
He's closing above 90%.

213
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,960
Go figure.

214
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Go freaking figure.

215
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,480
Paul King says he converted two commission clients to flat rate, got a referral, charged

216
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,200
them a set up fee to build himself.

217
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Beautiful.

218
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Paul King doing work.

219
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,600
Post it, bro.

220
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Post that crap, bro.

221
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
I want to know.

222
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,360
By the way, for these that are shy about posting, people are going to judge who cares.

223
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,800
It's way ... You're going to get ... That's awesome, dude.

224
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
You're making moves.

225
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
You're shaking moves.

226
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
Some of you guys are like, oh, I want to get a post.

227
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,080
By the way, most of the deals that we've been landing lately are just smaller deals.

228
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,240
Guess what?

229
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,040
We're building that muscle of asking people for money on landing deals.

230
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Paul, great job.

231
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Make a post about it.

232
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Let's let people know about it.

233
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,040
Let's get people excited.

234
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,240
What are you guys freaking ... I'm so glad that Paul said something.

235
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,480
I'm going to give Francesca a shout out.

236
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm going to yell at her for not posting about it if she hasn't already, haven't checked

237
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,760
the group.

238
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Francesca's doing work.

239
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
Porter's doing work.

240
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,000
Kyle's doing work.

241
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,840
My inner circle's doing work because I'm making them.

242
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,320
I'm not making them, but I'm hopefully inspiring them.

243
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,080
I'm telling them, like, hey, I'm going to hold you accountable.

244
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,600
I texted Kyle this morning, like I said, and I'm like, I'm holding you accountable, bro.

245
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,480
Have you done this, this, and this?

246
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,160
I have a group chat with my two brothers, not just Porter, my other one.

247
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,800
I'm like, hey, are you guys reading ... They're also reading the book.

248
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,280
What are you doing?

249
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,040
You paid to be here.

250
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,840
You paid great money to be here.

251
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
I'm showing up every single week.

252
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:38,120
I'm constantly giving you guys new things to think about, new things to work on.

253
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,320
We have amazing support.

254
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,680
You guys have somebody that helps you with ads.

255
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,520
You guys have somebody that helps you with all tech issues.

256
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
You guys have Kyle.

257
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
You have myself.

258
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
You have Ashley.

259
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
You have Porter.

260
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,440
You have Jason.

261
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:55,560
You have the exact blueprint that we used to close three other last four weeks closed

262
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,960
deals that Porter's using.

263
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,840
He's at $11,700 per month.

264
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,800
What are you doing?

265
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
What the heck are you doing?

266
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,880
I want you to think about it like that.

267
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Before you get angry or get frustrated that I keep coming at you, I'm going to keep coming

268
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,360
at you because I want you to feel bad.

269
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,480
I want you to feel like scum because if you're in this group and you're not doing anything,

270
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,920
then you should.

271
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,200
If you didn't ask somebody for money today, if you didn't prospect, guys, every single

272
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:30,400
one of you, if you're not on the phone every single day, Monday through Friday, go ahead,

273
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
take the weekend off.

274
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
I don't care.

275
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,160
I know when I was coming up, I was working Saturday mornings minimum and I have kids

276
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,640
and I got other stuff too, but I was working Saturday mornings doing sales calls.

277
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,600
I was doing something sales related every single day of the week.

278
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,080
You may not have the ability to ask somebody for money every single day because you don't

279
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,040
have enough deals in the pipe.

280
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,840
Every single one of you should be on the phone doing prospecting calls every single day,

281
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,160
but Nick, I don't have a campaign that's generating leads.

282
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
Who cares?

283
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,360
Go pick a random city and practice.

284
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,320
Get good at doing it while you're waiting or go hook somebody in advance.

285
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,320
Find the area that you want to go into and hook somebody while you wait for the leads

286
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
to come in.

287
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,640
I mean, heaven forbid.

288
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,000
Guys, the work that actually moves the needle is talking to business owners, doing sales.

289
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,260
That's the work that matters.

290
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,220
How much have you done this week?

291
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,380
My guess is that 99% of you guys haven't done jack shit.

292
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,500
That's the truth.

293
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
That's the truth.

294
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,020
Well, I watched some training videos.

295
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,700
I watched the live.

296
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,260
I spent an hour looking at due diligence.

297
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,260
Cool.

298
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,260
Good job.

299
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,620
Go do 100, then outsource it.

300
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,060
Go do 100 due diligence.

301
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,920
Master the process of finding a city and niche.

302
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,100
Go hire someone for pennies in the Philippines and get that off your plate and focus on sales.

303
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,900
Oh, but I wrote content.

304
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,900
Awesome.

305
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,780
Get 20,000 words of content for your first five websites.

306
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,860
Train somebody for the Philippines or Africa or whatever.

307
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,860
Create a process.

308
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,860
Outsource it.

309
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,860
Spend more time on sales.

310
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,860
You want to make more money?

311
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,500
Spend more time on sales.

312
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,180
Don't sit there and think that you're doing work because you're watching videos or you're

313
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,340
listening to freaking Joe Rogan or you're listening to Jocko Willink talking about

314
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,720
getting in the ice bath.

315
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Do sales.

316
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,460
Call people.

317
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,060
Knock on doors.

318
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,060
Do anything.

319
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,580
Listen to Facebook group.

320
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,580
Call your dad who's a real estate agent.

321
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,360
Call your uncle who's a real estate agent.

322
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Go do something.

323
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Okay?

324
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
But don't sit there.

325
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
Oh, my campaign.

326
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
I'm just waiting for my campaign.

327
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,260
Just waiting for you to come in.

328
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,460
Let me message Fix It Felix and ask another question.

329
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,460
Go do some work.

330
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,460
Okay?

331
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,460
It's been a long 10 cents.

332
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,400
I dropped the F word on this and I'm getting close on this call.

333
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,220
Go do some actual work and quit talking about the work you're going to do and start doing

334
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,220
the actual work.

335
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,100
I'm going to start treating this as if I have not made any money and then until you guys

336
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,980
get a deal, I have not made any money.

337
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,020
I'm going to have to frame my mind like that and that's how I'm going to start treating

338
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
you guys.

339
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:01,940
And the reality is that the way that most of you are acting and if I had structured this

340
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:07,740
program as I only get paid if you guys make money, 90% of you I wouldn't have let in this

341
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,740
program.

342
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,420
90% of you I wouldn't have let in here because you're not doing shit.

343
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,420
You're not doing anything.

344
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,820
And I would have known from the beginning that you weren't going to do anything because

345
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,140
it's a bunch of fuzz.

346
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,420
It's a bunch of just talking.

347
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,820
Most of you guys don't actually have enough pain that you want to get out of your situation.

348
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,660
You're just comfortable being in freaking mediocre-ville.

349
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,660
Awesome dude.

350
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,660
Congrats.

351
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
Congrats.

352
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,660
Go ahead and keep doing it.

353
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,660
And blame me.

354
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,660
Blame me.

355
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,660
Program doesn't work.

356
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,660
Works for Porter.

357
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,660
Works for Kyle.

358
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,660
Works for Francesca.

359
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,660
Made me millions.

360
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,660
Made Ryan Dalton a millionaire.

361
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,140
But it doesn't work for you because you have a special scenario.

362
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,140
I get it.

363
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,140
I get it.

364
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:52,820
90% of you, yes this is you, I wouldn't have let in this program if I only got paid on

365
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,300
you getting deals.

366
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,180
And not because it doesn't work, but because you're not doing anything.

367
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,180
Because you're not doing anything.

368
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,620
And it's sad.

369
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,820
It's a damn shame.

370
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,820
That's the truth.

371
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,980
Raphael, pitch the business on last Friday.

372
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,980
Great.

373
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
Post it, dude.

374
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
I love freaking hearing that.

375
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,540
Raphael, pitch it.

376
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,540
That's work.

377
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,540
Pitch the deal.

378
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,940
Call the business owner.

379
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,940
That's work.

380
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,940
Pitch the business owner last Friday.

381
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,740
Waiting for lead to offer him.

382
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,740
Great.

383
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,900
Google CPC was too expensive for me so I started Facebook.

384
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,900
That's great.

385
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Cool.

386
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Doing work.

387
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Jason says we need to be held accountable.

388
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,900
Thanks, Nick.

389
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,900
We'll have to be called out.

390
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,900
Jason, somebody who's at $13,000.

391
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,340
Of course, it's always the people that are actually doing work that don't mind being

392
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,620
called out because they're actually doing the work.

393
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
Go figure.

394
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,620
Okay.

395
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,780
It's funny that the people that are always sitting at the front of the meetings, when

396
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,380
you have the meetings that you're supposed to be at when no one sales, the bagel meetings,

397
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,340
you don't even have to be there if you got sales.

398
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,480
The people that got the sales are the ones on the front row with the pen and paper, ready

399
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
to learn.

400
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
That's Jason Allred.

401
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:59,660
That's why he's going to be a millionaire with his business, okay?

402
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,620
I wish we were in person so I could freaking just like ring some necks, okay?

403
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,420
Anyway, guys, I'm not giving up on you.

404
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,300
I want to just be like, hey, I'm done.

405
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,300
I'm tired.

406
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,300
Like, screw you guys.

407
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
You don't want to make money.

408
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,780
But I'm not going to do that because I know that you guys have the right model.

409
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,140
I know you guys have the right vehicle.

410
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,340
I've seen it change my life.

411
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,380
It's literally completely transformed my entire world.

412
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,360
It's allowed me to do things I never thought I'd be able to do at this age.

413
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,860
It's allowed me to go places, buy things, take care of people I never thought I could

414
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,300
do at this stage at 34 years old, okay?

415
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,440
It got me out of debt.

416
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,780
It's given me confidence that I can't even describe, that I can take care of those around

417
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,580
me.

418
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:46,220
It's done everything for me, this business model and this exact program, these steps,

419
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,260
these scripts, these niches that I'm going into, these things that I'm talking about.

420
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,700
You guys are so damn tired of getting messages about, oh, this doesn't work.

421
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,940
You didn't know where the script's at?

422
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,660
Dude, if you don't know how to find something in the Facebook group, then just ask AI.

423
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,660
You know what you could do?

424
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,460
Go to chat GPT or Google, which has AI at the top.

425
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,580
How do I find an answer to my question in the Facebook group?

426
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,580
Some of you guys need to do that, okay?

427
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,820
Quote waste of my time sending me a message about where the script is.

428
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
Go look.

429
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,820
Go freaking look.

430
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:22,020
I was watching this video yesterday about learning, how to learn, and the guy's like,

431
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,740
you should outline the project.

432
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,420
You should say, hey, here's what I want to do is I'm going to build this project and

433
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,820
then start, and then you're going to have the questions that you need to answer, and

434
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,300
then you're going to go find those answers.

435
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,300
Guess what?

436
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,420
Because you had to struggle, because you had to look, you actually are going to remember

437
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,980
the things that you found.

438
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,260
Why do you guys think that when you message me 400 times to get an answer that takes

439
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,340
you 10 seconds to find, I don't respond, or I tell my team to hold off?

440
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,900
Because if I'm just sitting there spoon feeding you, I'm turning you into nothing.

441
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,260
You're not going to become anything.

442
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,020
Guys, it's every answer to every one of your questions, I promise you, is in this group.

443
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,420
This group's been around for three years.

444
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,420
Every question's been asked.

445
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,420
If it's not here, it's in the Q&A section of the Kajabi training.

446
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,420
If it's not there, it's in one of the modules.

447
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,740
You're going to have to look a little bit, but guess what?

448
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,820
You're actually going to remember it.

449
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,900
Stop spending time on stupid stuff.

450
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,780
Stop.

451
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,220
You should be doing cold calls every single day, because that's the one thing that's going

452
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,740
to make you money.

453
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,740
That's all I got.

454
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,740
I'm out.

455
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:25,760
See you guys.
