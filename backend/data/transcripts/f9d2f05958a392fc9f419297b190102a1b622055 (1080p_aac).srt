1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Alex says, I have a deck building site

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,400
in a smaller town, population 30K,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,880
ranking number one organically.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,880
I have a client on the line for the free leads.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,520
Should I run some ads to increase calls

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,160
even though I'm already ranking number one organically?

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,200
Yes, yes, yes, and yes, and it will help.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,120
Okay, let me prove this to you.

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,480
Alex, gotta call it in.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,520
Okay, I got a call from my concrete guy,

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,880
and if you were on my interview with Juan,

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,200
you will hear me and turn to, hey, I'm on Zoom,

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,240
I'll call you back.

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,200
So as you can see, I'm ranked number one.

15
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,180
My GMB fluctuates right now.

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,600
It's getting its ass handed to it, which kinda sucks,

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,840
but we just barely did citations and new review today.

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,880
But I am number one for most all terms.

19
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,940
I am number one organically, just like your site, right?

20
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,940
And I'm also running ads because when my ads are down,

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,640
there's a verification issue or any of this shit,

22
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,920
there's a significant drop.

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
Even though I'm number one,

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,360
there are still a lot of people

25
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,640
that are clicking and paying for,

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,840
it's charging me, they're clicking on these, okay?

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,480
So yes, it will help.

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,400
Yes, you will get different leads.

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,680
You will see some overlap.

30
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,000
Some of those people you could argue,

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,520
yeah, they would've called you anyway,

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,440
but I would definitely,

33
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,080
if you're trying to speed this process up,

34
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,880
throw up an ad, speed this up,

35
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,720
because as Juan was saying today on the interview,

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,540
it's all about that sizzle, right?

37
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,040
You guys, sending three leads in three days

38
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,560
is significantly different than sending three leads

39
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,440
over the course of a week or two weeks, okay?

40
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,400
You have a much higher chance of closing that person

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,240
if it's the lead, lead, lead,

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,460
than if it's lead two, three days, lead,

43
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,720
three, four days, lead.

44
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,920
The momentum's gone.

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,280
The sizzle is gone, okay?

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
So yes, answer your question, yes, Alex.
