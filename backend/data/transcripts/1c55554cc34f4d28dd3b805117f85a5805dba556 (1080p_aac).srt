Bruce says, do you do press releases for your Legion sites?

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,920
I've heard they can help new sites get a small amount of traction.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,560
I don't know, just personally, okay?

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,240
And I can't even speak on that.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,560
I've been part of groups, I've been pitched on doing press releases.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,360
I know people have different opinions.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:29,040
I have built my billion dollar seven figure $100,000 month agency,

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,280
literally doing the keyword, building my keyword list,

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,480
the way I teach you guys how to do it in the training.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,000
Literally sitting down and it helps if you have a dual monitor,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,400
but you don't have to sitting down when I didn't have a dual monitor,

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,440
I would print off a list of the keywords and I would be typing on my content.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,000
I would start with five questions and I would literally go through

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,800
and I'd start writing and every time I would do a keyword,

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,440
I'd make a check mark or a strike and I would manually check

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,680
and make sure I included as many keywords as possible, but didn't overuse it.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,840
And then when I got the dual screen, I would have the keywords over here

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,720
and the document over here and I would do the exact same thing,

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,920
except it was digitally.

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,000
And I have built a seven figure agency writing content, old school.
