WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.480
So, what do you do when the customer objects?

00:13.480 --> 00:17.200
You go through the whole thing, you do the Amex or Visa, you do the Assumption close

00:17.200 --> 00:19.840
and the customer says they want to think about it, the customer has to talk to their business

00:19.840 --> 00:24.960
partner, the customer this, the customer that, they got to check their budget, whatever.

00:24.960 --> 00:29.740
We should know what the objections are gonna be and you're probably going, oh crap, I forgot

00:29.740 --> 00:34.340
to hit on that one or I didn't hit on it hard enough and you're gonna know exactly what

00:34.340 --> 00:35.740
you did wrong in that moment.

00:35.740 --> 00:36.740
What do you do?

00:36.740 --> 00:40.780
Okay, well first of all, what you don't do is you don't give up because 99% of sales

00:40.780 --> 00:44.540
people are taught that this is where the deal starts, right?

00:44.540 --> 00:47.660
You got the grant card notes out there, this is where the deal starts, this is the objections,

00:47.660 --> 00:48.660
right?

00:48.660 --> 00:52.300
And it's like, kind of true, but I'm a big believer in just overcoming the objection.

00:52.300 --> 00:55.820
However, you are gonna have times where you forget, you are gonna have times where you

00:55.820 --> 00:59.460
don't do it correctly, you are gonna have times where you've done it so many times you get

00:59.540 --> 01:03.660
lazy and you forget to do, to overcome the objection beforehand.

01:03.660 --> 01:05.580
You forgot to check if they watched the screencast.

01:05.580 --> 01:07.300
You are going to have to deal with objections.

01:07.300 --> 01:11.060
The cool part is because we've focused so much on the setup, the objections are gonna

01:11.060 --> 01:12.060
be minimal.

01:12.060 --> 01:16.140
We're not gonna have to dig through a treasure trove of objections to close this thing, okay?

01:16.140 --> 01:20.780
So I'm gonna do a very basic training on how to handle objections, which we will do more

01:20.780 --> 01:24.640
in-depth training later, but I want you guys to notice something.

01:24.640 --> 01:28.600
Most sales trainings, they would spend majority of their time talking about this part, which

01:28.600 --> 01:33.160
is the objection handling, but I've spent most of my time talking about the setup and

01:33.160 --> 01:36.840
the close because you can just overcome it all there, okay?

01:36.840 --> 01:38.480
However, I do know this happens.

01:38.480 --> 01:42.300
It even happens with me from time to time and it's usually, well, it's not usually,

01:42.300 --> 01:43.300
it is your fault.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.300
You missed a step, okay?

01:44.300 --> 01:45.360
But what do you do?

01:45.360 --> 01:48.920
So I'm gonna go over a quick little training and the first thing that you wanna do is you

01:48.920 --> 01:50.680
have to tie them down, okay?

01:50.680 --> 01:54.920
And I have an entire video that we did, a live stream, and we'll try and link it up

01:55.240 --> 01:59.420
or make it accessible, but we did this entire training on this concept, okay?

01:59.420 --> 02:03.440
First thing that you need to do is you need to tie them down to that objection, okay?

02:03.440 --> 02:08.500
Think of it as you're trying to get them into a corner so you can kill them, right?

02:08.500 --> 02:12.520
Which I know is a little aggressive or a better example maybe of not using something so extreme

02:12.520 --> 02:17.880
is all of the, you're in a house and you want to keep all the air in the house, right?

02:17.880 --> 02:20.120
And every window that's open is an objection.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.200
And in order for you to close the sale, you need to get all the windows closed, right?

02:23.280 --> 02:26.880
And every window is an objection, so you're just going through closed, closed, closed,

02:26.880 --> 02:30.960
closed, but you need to find out which windows are closed and which windows are open.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.580
So first thing you need to do is you need to tie them down.

02:33.580 --> 02:38.120
So here's what I would do is if they say I need to talk to, or let's use a different

02:38.120 --> 02:39.120
example.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.960
That one rarely should come up because you should make sure that the business owner's

02:42.960 --> 02:45.240
partners are on the phone or that they're the decision maker.

02:45.240 --> 02:46.240
That shouldn't come up.

02:46.240 --> 02:52.760
But let's say that they object and say they wanna think about it, which is pretty common,

02:53.320 --> 02:56.640
let me mull this over, let me get back to you.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.920
That's a really common objection.

02:58.920 --> 03:03.400
So here's what you're gonna do is you're gonna say, yeah, and you're gonna say, you're gonna

03:03.400 --> 03:04.400
agree first.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.680
You're gonna go, yeah, I feel you, man, I totally get it.

03:07.680 --> 03:08.680
And you're gonna tie them down.

03:08.680 --> 03:12.480
You're gonna go, so let me just ask you this and then, this will be really quick, let me

03:12.480 --> 03:15.080
just ask you this and then we'll hop off, because I don't want them to feel like we're

03:15.080 --> 03:17.000
getting into battle mode, right?

03:17.000 --> 03:21.880
So I'll say, besides just thinking about it, is there any other questions, does anything

03:22.000 --> 03:26.840
else, besides just like the fact of thinking about it, anything else that doesn't make

03:26.840 --> 03:32.200
sense, like assuming you think about it and it makes sense, like is there any other reason

03:32.200 --> 03:36.200
that you wouldn't wanna move forward with this today, okay?

03:36.200 --> 03:37.600
And you have to tie them down.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.200
Because if you don't, then there could be multiple objections.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.780
This could be what they call a smoke screen.

03:42.780 --> 03:44.480
It's not the real objection, right?

03:44.480 --> 03:48.520
So what you're gonna find is when you say that, sometimes they'll go, well, I mean,

03:48.520 --> 03:51.440
I need to think about it, but also I need to check with my partner.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.120
And you go, oh, I forgot that one too.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.120
So now you got two.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.160
So okay, all right, so besides thinking about it and besides talking to your partner, is

03:59.160 --> 04:02.920
there any other reason or any other question of why this wouldn't make sense today, why

04:02.920 --> 04:04.480
you wouldn't wanna move forward today?

04:04.480 --> 04:06.360
Nope, that's it, okay?

04:06.360 --> 04:08.000
And now you can start digging in.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.320
But what we've done is we've taken all that list of objections and we've eliminated all

04:12.320 --> 04:15.440
the other ones and we've narrowed it down to one or two, okay?

04:15.440 --> 04:18.560
So in this example, I'm gonna just share if you've got one objection, because if you guys

04:18.560 --> 04:21.840
are doing this correctly, you should have no objections and if you miss a step, you

04:21.840 --> 04:23.640
should have only one.

04:23.640 --> 04:27.240
But I'm gonna just assume this person just wants to think about it, okay?

04:27.240 --> 04:30.560
And so then what you're gonna wanna do is dig in a little bit and be like, so if you

04:30.560 --> 04:34.400
don't mind me asking, what exactly do you wanna think about?

04:34.400 --> 04:37.480
Because to me, everything sounds like it makes sense.

04:37.480 --> 04:38.840
And listen, okay?

04:38.840 --> 04:42.880
Don't let it sound salesy, don't put pressure, but listen to what they say.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.160
What exactly do you wanna think about, okay?

04:45.160 --> 04:48.120
And they're gonna tell you, they're gonna say.

04:48.120 --> 04:53.620
And then you're gonna listen and look at cues and try to pick up on what they're actually

04:53.620 --> 04:56.120
saying, not just the words that are coming out of their mouth, okay?

04:56.120 --> 04:57.520
So you're gonna tie it down.

04:57.520 --> 05:01.180
You're gonna ask a follow-up question or two about that objection.

05:01.180 --> 05:02.180
Maybe it's a spouse.

05:02.180 --> 05:07.640
Okay, what exactly do you need to talk to your partner about, right?

05:07.640 --> 05:10.760
Do you need his blessing, her blessing?

05:10.760 --> 05:11.760
Is he the actual decision-maker?

05:11.760 --> 05:13.240
Am I talking to the wrong person?

05:13.240 --> 05:15.160
You can do a little pride game there.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.460
Dig into it, okay?

05:16.460 --> 05:22.020
And then you're gonna use the magic feel felt found, okay?

05:22.020 --> 05:23.020
It's a three-step process.

05:23.020 --> 05:25.720
So as I said before, we want to agree.

05:25.720 --> 05:35.180
So they're gonna say, yeah, I just wanna make sure that this is the right decision, right?

05:35.180 --> 05:40.140
Because it's like 2,000 bucks, I just wanna make sure it's a good decision, right?

05:40.140 --> 05:41.540
Yeah, I feel you, man.

05:41.540 --> 05:43.900
I feel you, ma'am, ma'am, man.

05:43.900 --> 05:44.900
I feel it.

05:44.900 --> 05:45.900
You're gonna agree first.

05:46.340 --> 05:47.340
I totally understand.

05:47.340 --> 05:48.340
I feel you, okay?

05:48.340 --> 05:49.340
That's it.

05:49.340 --> 05:50.340
Just say, I feel you.

05:50.340 --> 05:52.540
Just let them know you understand.

05:52.540 --> 05:56.100
Then what you're gonna do is you're gonna use an example, and this is why it's really

05:56.100 --> 05:59.740
important to have a bunch of examples in your back pocket, which we'll get into later.

05:59.740 --> 06:02.380
You're gonna use an example of one of your clients, okay?

06:02.380 --> 06:05.380
And this could be one of my clients, one of somebody else's clients, or one of your own

06:05.380 --> 06:09.820
clients, and that's why you need to have a pocketbook full of these, a Rolodex full of

06:09.820 --> 06:10.820
these.

06:10.820 --> 06:14.760
You're gonna say, funny that you say that, do you remember that guy Brooks that I was

06:14.840 --> 06:16.840
showing you earlier, the Bentonville Concord guy?

06:16.840 --> 06:18.440
Yeah, I remember him.

06:18.440 --> 06:23.000
Okay, he, when we talked, and again, this has been a couple years ago, he felt the exact

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
same way.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
We talked, and everything looked right, and he's just like, dude, I just want to think

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
about it.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.360
So, just so you know, I'm with you, okay?

06:30.360 --> 06:32.560
So Phil felt, right?

06:32.560 --> 06:36.280
Brooks, it's way different than if you say, yeah, man, I get you.

06:36.280 --> 06:39.320
I felt the same way, blank, right?

06:39.320 --> 06:43.280
You, of course you felt the same way, and you're gonna try and convince them, but when

06:43.280 --> 06:47.640
it's Brooks, when it's the client, it's totally different, it's a third party, right?

06:47.640 --> 06:50.880
So yeah, you remember Brooks, yeah, he felt the exact same way.

06:50.880 --> 06:57.280
That comes to step three, which is what he found, so you're gonna go, yeah, but after

06:57.280 --> 07:02.800
we talked about it, and I asked him, Brooks, what do you want to think about, what he found,

07:02.800 --> 07:07.440
or what he realized, doesn't need to be those exact words, but what he realized is that

07:07.440 --> 07:12.440
he was already paying for Google Ads, he wanted exclusive leads, he was tired of the leads

07:12.480 --> 07:17.680
being pimped out, and that there was really no risk, because even if I only, if I just

07:17.680 --> 07:22.600
sent him 10 leads, or 12 leads, he was gonna at the very least double his money.

07:22.600 --> 07:27.320
And so, what he ended up doing, he's like, dude, really it's just me being, like, putting

07:27.320 --> 07:29.680
off the inevitable, so let's do it.

07:29.680 --> 07:34.000
So Brian, you know this makes sense, you've seen the case studies, you already told me

07:34.000 --> 07:39.600
that I'm not full of crap, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, let's do the deal, man.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.720
Are you an Amex or Visa?

07:40.720 --> 07:42.400
Let's quit messing around, okay?

07:42.400 --> 07:45.480
And you're gonna go back for the close, okay?

07:45.480 --> 07:50.920
I know that might sound scary, but you know what's more scary is being broke.

07:50.920 --> 07:54.920
You know what's more scary is getting off the call and missing out on a $2,000 per month

07:54.920 --> 08:02.280
deal, a $24,000 per year deal that you could have gotten by just saying one line that was

08:02.280 --> 08:04.200
a little bit uncomfortable for you in that moment.

08:04.200 --> 08:09.600
And I understand, I'm not that aggressive, but I get it, I get it, but guess what, get

08:09.920 --> 08:14.200
used to being uncomfortable once in a while, because you're gonna have to get uncomfortable

08:14.200 --> 08:15.200
to be comfortable.

08:15.200 --> 08:21.800
You know what's comfortable is using that $2,000 to sip my ties on the beach in Mexico

08:21.800 --> 08:26.440
and have people rub cocoa butter on your belly while you're reading a book, okay?

08:26.440 --> 08:27.440
That's comfortable.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.360
But you're gonna have to use a little bit of, you're gonna have to go through a little

08:30.360 --> 08:33.080
bit of discomfort sometimes to get to the comfortable.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.600
So what I do in these moments when I'm like, oh, this is gonna be awkward, I start thinking

08:36.600 --> 08:39.360
about, hey, this might be a little awkward, I'm not comfortable.

08:39.360 --> 08:43.560
I wouldn't choose to do this on my spare time, but you know what, this is that hour

08:43.560 --> 08:47.320
I psyched myself up before, this is where I need to meet business, and I need to get

08:47.320 --> 08:51.360
to business, and it might be a little uncomfortable, and it might be a little, but guess what,

08:51.360 --> 08:55.040
I want the money more than I care about the discomfort, than I wanted to avoid the discomfort,

08:55.040 --> 08:56.040
and I'll say it.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.960
I'll go, look, Brian, let's just talk real here.

08:58.960 --> 09:02.820
You know you need to do this, and there's not another option out there like this.

09:02.820 --> 09:04.200
Everything checks the boxes.

09:04.200 --> 09:08.880
What card are we putting on file, man, let's not mess around, okay, come on, come on, man.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.080
You already know the answer.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.240
You know that the second we get off this call, you already know the answer, okay.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.760
You can put this off as long as you want, and you also know that, and guys, this is

09:16.760 --> 09:21.440
the beautiful part, is we've already told them if we've done this correctly, well, some

09:21.440 --> 09:24.440
of you guys might not have, and that might be why they wanna think about it, right, but

09:24.440 --> 09:29.320
if we've done this correctly, we can remind them, hey, I already told you, I have a call

09:29.320 --> 09:35.440
in an hour, right, I would like to do the deal with you, so, and again, make sure to

09:35.440 --> 09:36.440
have the no fear of loss.

09:36.600 --> 09:40.600
Look, at the same time, I wanna do this, I wanna work with you, if it doesn't make sense,

09:40.600 --> 09:46.280
I'll work with them, but I know this makes sense, so, what's the card, man?

09:46.280 --> 09:50.280
Let's do this, okay, what's the card, man?

09:50.280 --> 09:57.720
Be bold, so, just to recap, really, really quick, okay, tie them down, make sure that's

09:57.720 --> 10:02.600
the objection and the only, okay, ask a few follow-up questions to understand the objection,

10:02.600 --> 10:07.480
then you're gonna use the Phil felt found method, and you're gonna go back for the close,

10:07.480 --> 10:08.040
that's it.
