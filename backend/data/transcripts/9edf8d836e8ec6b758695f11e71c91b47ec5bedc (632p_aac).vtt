00:00.000 --> 00:07.880
Okay, guys, welcome to the call.

00:07.880 --> 00:09.640
Today we're going to be talking about sub-nitching.

00:09.640 --> 00:10.880
We've been talking a lot about niches.

00:10.880 --> 00:15.900
We've been talking a lot about picking the right city.

00:15.900 --> 00:20.040
Basically the first step in the process, which I believe is the most important process apart

00:20.040 --> 00:24.240
from the sales and getting the deal and getting people to give you their money, this is the

00:24.240 --> 00:29.560
very most important part of the entire process.

00:29.560 --> 00:33.080
This is one of the, I think, what is the date?

00:33.080 --> 00:35.880
It's August 12th.

00:35.880 --> 00:40.760
We're really focusing in this quarter on this first step, and so if it seems like we're

00:40.760 --> 00:48.960
going very nuanced, it's because we are, and that is because I know when I say it, when

00:48.960 --> 00:54.240
you first hear about this model, it's like, okay, pick a city, pick a niche, rank the

00:54.240 --> 00:55.240
website, rank it out.

00:55.240 --> 00:58.280
Boom, that's the 20,000-foot view, and that is actually true.

00:58.560 --> 01:04.840
However, you'll realize that all the money is in these tiny little adjustments.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.040
It's in that 10%.

01:07.040 --> 01:11.320
It's the difference between making a million dollars a year and making $10,000 a year is

01:11.320 --> 01:13.120
in the nuance.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.120
We are talking about nuance.

01:14.120 --> 01:19.800
Today we're going to be talking about specifically sub-nitching so that you guys can, and so

01:19.800 --> 01:21.920
I'm going to get into what we're going to cover and all that kind of stuff, but we're

01:21.920 --> 01:28.200
going to be talking about sub-nitching inside of picking your perfect niche for whatever

01:28.400 --> 01:31.400
project, whatever industry you decide to go into.

01:31.400 --> 01:35.920
Okay, so hold on.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.640
Can everybody hear me, by the way?

01:37.640 --> 01:38.640
You can hear me, right?

01:38.640 --> 01:39.640
Yeah, you're good.

01:39.640 --> 01:40.640
Okay.

01:40.640 --> 01:44.160
I got another notification that said this meeting was being recorded, so I didn't know

01:44.160 --> 01:46.840
if that was an error or what.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.880
Okay, guys, what I'm going to do, give me one second.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.120
I'm going to just open this window.

01:51.120 --> 01:52.120
Hold on.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.120
Get some light in here.

01:58.200 --> 02:11.720
Okay, you can still hear me, Aaron?

02:11.720 --> 02:12.720
Absolutely.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.720
Beautiful.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.720
Okay, Aaron's going to be in charge of letting people in.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.920
He's also going to be in charge of kicking people out.

02:17.920 --> 02:24.480
He's going to be in charge of comments, questions, et cetera, and I'm going to leave time for

02:24.560 --> 02:28.600
questions because I think that we've gotten in the last, this is our sixth week doing

02:28.600 --> 02:29.600
this, right, Aaron?

02:29.600 --> 02:30.600
Yeah, that our seventh.

02:30.600 --> 02:31.600
Okay, this is our seventh.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.600
It might be.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.600
I got to count.

02:33.600 --> 02:42.080
Okay, sixth or seventh, and we have had really, really good questions from these groups because

02:42.080 --> 02:48.720
basically what these groups consist of is the people inside of the free group, the ones

02:48.720 --> 02:51.920
that are actually serious about taking actions, the ones that actually want to go and make

02:51.920 --> 02:58.240
some money and do something and don't just want to listen, they want to apply.

02:58.240 --> 03:02.960
We have had really, really good questions that we're going to save some time for, okay?

03:02.960 --> 03:09.240
Want to remind everybody that if you guys keep your cameras on and stay to the end,

03:09.240 --> 03:12.920
we're going to take everything that we covered today and we're going to turn it into a digital

03:12.920 --> 03:17.400
resource and we're going to just DM you guys from Donnie Dre.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.520
He's going to DM you the digital resource.

03:19.520 --> 03:23.200
I'm not going to have to comment anywhere, poke, whatever.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.980
You're going to just automatically get it by staying on this call till the end and keeping

03:26.980 --> 03:27.980
your camera on.

03:27.980 --> 03:32.720
Okay, so that's number one, and what we're going to do is at the end, Aaron is going

03:32.720 --> 03:36.120
to screenshot everybody that's on this call, okay?

03:36.120 --> 03:37.720
Again, make sure your camera's on.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.480
We're not trying to be weird, but we want to make sure that the people that are on are

03:40.480 --> 03:45.720
actually on and we have that good energy, we have that good participation when it was

03:45.720 --> 03:46.720
having a bunch of dead weight.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.160
Okay, I'm a big fan of not having dead weight.

03:49.160 --> 03:55.880
That's the whole reason that we're doing this on Zoom rather than doing it in Facebook,

03:55.880 --> 03:56.880
okay?

03:56.880 --> 04:00.520
So that said, guys, let's get into this really, really quick.

04:00.520 --> 04:04.600
Aaron, does it look like we have anybody new?

04:04.600 --> 04:09.320
In fact, what I want to do as we get started, I want to know really quick, is there anybody

04:09.320 --> 04:13.560
in the comments, is anybody ... No, actually, it's what I want to do.

04:13.560 --> 04:19.680
In the comments, I want to know how many calls you've been on since we changed the format.

04:19.680 --> 04:25.720
Since we went to doing Zoom calls, these intimate Zoom calls, I want to know how many calls

04:25.720 --> 04:26.720
have you actually been on?

04:26.720 --> 04:31.320
Is this your first put one, if it's your third put three, if it's your fifth put five, if

04:31.320 --> 04:32.320
it's whatever.

04:32.320 --> 04:36.080
I want to know really quick, and then Aaron, I want you to start reading and let me know

04:36.080 --> 04:39.320
so I kind of have an idea how many calls everyone's been on.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.320
Yeah.

04:40.320 --> 04:45.000
This is the second one for Todd, first one for Trey, first one for Christopher, fourth

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
for Shane.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
He's been with us for a while.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
Jaleel, it's the second one, Jen's the third, Elden's the first, Jose's the first, Theo's

04:52.000 --> 04:56.800
the third, and then Matthew's likely my eighth, so yeah, Matthew's been hanging with us.

04:56.800 --> 05:00.720
So yeah, we got a couple people though for their first.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.200
Is that Matthew Torres?

05:02.200 --> 05:03.200
Yeah.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.240
Okay, girl, dope.

05:05.240 --> 05:09.280
So I was going to actually ... My next question was, and going to let everybody know, any

05:09.360 --> 05:12.760
of you, I think there's one or two I heard, maybe just one, maybe it's Matthew, but if

05:12.760 --> 05:17.760
you are in digital landlords, you are going to get these recordings regardless.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.960
I'm glad you're on these live because I think it's good.

05:19.960 --> 05:23.760
You can ask questions, whatever, however, you're going to get these recordings inside

05:23.760 --> 05:25.680
of the training material as well.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.680
So just heads up.

05:26.680 --> 05:27.680
Okay.

05:27.680 --> 05:33.560
The reason I wanted to ask is I wanted to know how familiar people are with me.

05:33.640 --> 05:41.040
So really, really quick, I like to start every call with a one-minute synopsis of just my,

05:41.040 --> 05:43.800
I guess my pedigree, my credibility here.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.160
I don't think you should listen to anybody on the internet personally.

05:46.160 --> 05:50.640
I think you should assume everybody's full of crap, but for what it's worth, my name's

05:50.640 --> 05:51.640
Nick Wood.

05:51.640 --> 05:52.640
I've been doing this since 2016.

05:52.640 --> 05:56.760
I had a little nine-month period where I chased shiny pennies.

05:56.760 --> 06:02.640
I lost a bunch of money doing software or trying to do software, and it woke me up and

06:02.680 --> 06:05.360
showed me just how good this business model was.

06:05.360 --> 06:09.760
And sometimes you have to lose everything to realize what you have, which is true in

06:09.760 --> 06:11.200
every single facet of life.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.040
That's what happened to me.

06:13.040 --> 06:18.840
And out of necessity, I either had to get a job to pay for my bills and take care of

06:18.840 --> 06:21.920
my family, or I had to start doing this.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.920
And I choose this every single day of the week.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.120
Anyway, I lost a lot of money.

06:27.120 --> 06:32.400
I've spent over about a million and a half dollars on Google ads alone.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.440
I went $60,000 in debt.

06:34.440 --> 06:39.360
I've had companies go bankrupt on me that owed me $15,000 plus.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.760
I've hired and fired the wrong people.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.360
I've gotten office space, and I shouldn't have gotten office space.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.120
I made it through COVID.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.120
I have almost quit twice.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.640
I've gone into the wrong niches.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.200
I've gone into the wrong sub-niches.

06:50.200 --> 06:54.080
I've built over 200 websites, half of which were in the wrong niches.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.800
I have done just about everything wrong that you can imagine.

06:57.800 --> 07:02.120
And also, on the other hand, in 2020, I finally figured this out.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.600
I figured out how to scale.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.760
I figured out the missing pieces of this business model.

07:06.760 --> 07:11.840
And we scaled this business to $100,000 per month, and we haven't looked back since.

07:11.840 --> 07:17.240
Just over seven figures in 2020 did over $1.4 million in 2021.

07:17.240 --> 07:21.000
And then we haven't looked back since then as well.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.280
And I tell you that so that as I'm talking to you, you're not sitting here going, who

07:26.280 --> 07:27.280
is this guy?

07:27.280 --> 07:29.360
Is this another person that's just talking?

07:29.360 --> 07:30.520
You should assume that.

07:30.520 --> 07:34.320
But I want you to also know that I don't speak, for example, today what we're talking about,

07:34.320 --> 07:35.320
this is all going to be from experience.

07:35.320 --> 07:39.080
And I'm going to go over kind of our game plan of what we're going to be talking about

07:39.080 --> 07:40.080
here in just a moment.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.080
And so you guys have an outline.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.560
But this is only from experience.

07:42.560 --> 07:46.160
And if I haven't done it, I'm going to tell you, and I do this because this is what I

07:46.160 --> 07:47.160
wish that I had.

07:47.160 --> 07:53.080
I wish that somebody who was basically five years ahead of me or millions of dollars ahead

07:53.080 --> 07:56.640
of me could have been on a live and I could have asked them questions.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.400
I could have asked them about this niche and that niche and what do you think about this

07:59.440 --> 08:02.600
and what about running ads and what about scaling and who do you hire?

08:02.600 --> 08:05.840
What about outsourcing and all these different things that I never knew.

08:05.840 --> 08:08.880
And I would ask these questions, guys, to these groups that I was a part of.

08:08.880 --> 08:12.800
But nobody in these groups had done what I wanted to do.

08:12.800 --> 08:17.840
And I'm a huge proponent, a huge believer that if you have not done what I want to do,

08:17.840 --> 08:19.720
I cannot listen to you.

08:19.720 --> 08:23.520
I'll listen to you out of respect if I have to come in the room with you, but I'm not

08:23.520 --> 08:24.520
going to take your advice.

08:24.520 --> 08:28.640
OK, I'm not going to take advice from a trainer who doesn't have the body that I want.

08:28.680 --> 08:33.920
I'm not going to take advice from a financial planner who doesn't have the the bank account

08:33.920 --> 08:36.120
that I want and the investment portfolio that I want.

08:36.440 --> 08:40.160
I'm not going to take marriage advice from somebody that doesn't have a thriving marriage,

08:40.160 --> 08:41.560
somebody that I'm not going to do that.

08:41.760 --> 08:47.120
And so I want you guys to know, as I'm talking on this call, I am somebody that's done this

08:47.280 --> 08:52.440
and I've now trained over six hundred and seventy people to do this, one of which, Mr.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.320
Ryan Dalton, who just barely got into this two years ago, I'm happy to say, is making

08:56.320 --> 08:58.040
over seventy five thousand dollars per month.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.240
I think is absolutely incredible.

09:00.440 --> 09:05.160
He's also got two kids, a wife, a dog, hobbies and everything else.

09:05.360 --> 09:09.880
So any excuse that you have for why you can't do this is an excuse.

09:09.920 --> 09:10.920
OK, that's just the truth.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.440
When I started this, it wasn't good time.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.200
OK, it's never good timing.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.880
I'm just going to let you guys know if you haven't started and you're waiting for the

09:17.880 --> 09:22.120
perfect time, then hop off the call right now because it's not going to ever be good

09:22.120 --> 09:24.240
timing. It's never good timing to do anything.

09:24.240 --> 09:27.680
It's never good timing to get married, never good timing to have a kid, never good timing

09:27.680 --> 09:30.680
to start a business or to take that opportunity or do anything.

09:30.920 --> 09:37.000
And you're going to realize that you only get a couple of chances in life to like good,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.360
good chances of opportunities.

09:39.360 --> 09:44.400
And if you don't get in the habit of taking advantage of those, then you're you're you're

09:44.400 --> 09:45.800
going to look back with regret.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.920
And if you think that the timing is going to be perfect, you're crazy.

09:51.080 --> 09:54.720
OK, when I started this business, I was knocking doors full time.

09:54.960 --> 09:59.160
I had it. I was managing a team of 20 people with with a friend of mine.

09:59.400 --> 10:04.520
So every single day I was knocking doors during the day, doing meetings until nine,

10:04.520 --> 10:08.640
ten at night. And then I was working on my business during the day or sorry, during the

10:08.640 --> 10:10.840
night. That was my that was my schedule.

10:10.840 --> 10:15.120
So anybody that's sitting here saying I don't have time, whatever, whatever, whatever,

10:15.720 --> 10:21.520
that's not true. OK, so guys, the goal today, my promise to you guys for you guys today

10:21.680 --> 10:26.560
is that I'm going to give you guys enough knowledge on sub niching that you're going to

10:26.560 --> 10:32.840
have the confidence to go into big, hairy, scary niches in a sub niche with a sub niche

10:32.840 --> 10:35.320
angle. And you're going to do so without being worried.

10:35.320 --> 10:38.160
You're going to do so without thinking that you're just going to lose your shorts and

10:38.160 --> 10:39.880
you're going to do so very, very confidently.

10:39.920 --> 10:44.080
That's my promise. The plan today, kind of the outline of what I want to cover over the

10:44.080 --> 10:47.320
next 20 minutes before we get into Q&A is number one, I want to talk about what is sub

10:47.320 --> 10:53.800
niching. OK, number two is I want to talk about why I think you should always err on

10:53.800 --> 10:57.400
the side of sub niching, even with the non-competitive niches.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.880
And I'm going to get into that throughout this.

10:59.920 --> 11:05.880
OK, I also want to talk about how my screw ups led me to figure out sub niching and

11:05.880 --> 11:07.720
they forced me to figure out sub niching.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.840
I'm going to give you guys some examples on sub niching.

11:11.720 --> 11:15.960
We're going to talk about how there's always a sub niche angle, easy ways to find sub

11:15.960 --> 11:20.000
niches. And finally, I'm going to give you an example of one of my sub niche websites.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.000
And then we're going to do some Q&A.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.080
OK, so that said, I want you guys, if you have questions, I want you to start dropping

11:28.080 --> 11:32.160
them right now because I am going to go rapid fire, get through as many as possible.

11:32.160 --> 11:35.360
Last time we did a really good job and we got through a ton of questions.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.360
I don't think there was any question that we didn't get through.

11:37.560 --> 11:43.640
So, Aaron, while I'm turning down the AC, like I always do and I forget to do, will

11:43.640 --> 11:45.480
you please see if there's any comments really quick?

11:45.480 --> 11:47.360
Give me one second. All right is.

11:54.960 --> 12:00.240
Think we should all invest in an auto air conditioner adjuster app or something for

12:00.240 --> 12:02.200
that, because literally every single week.

12:03.440 --> 12:10.680
But, you know. OK, was there any comments?

12:10.960 --> 12:12.440
No, we're ready to just get to it.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.240
Let's do it. OK, let's do this thing, guys.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.280
So let's talk about sub niching really quick.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.360
I'm not going to waste time on stuff.

12:18.360 --> 12:22.960
It doesn't matter. Sub niching is taking a big niche and going into something that is

12:22.960 --> 12:26.960
more narrow. OK, it's it's and we always hear the riches are in the niches.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.920
And that is true.

12:29.360 --> 12:35.400
And the thing that you don't realize when you get into this is everyone thinks of like

12:35.400 --> 12:42.320
these big niches that are top of mind, HVAC, roofing, plumbing, solar, blah, blah,

12:42.320 --> 12:43.160
blah, blah, blah. Right.

12:43.160 --> 12:47.880
Everyone has I get if you know how many times someone's messaged me and said, hey,

12:47.880 --> 12:50.440
what do you think about getting solar leads or what about this?

12:50.760 --> 12:56.760
I would be very, very, very rich, very rich because everyone asks the same questions.

12:57.200 --> 13:02.360
And the truth is, as I've said before, you can get you can get leads in any niche.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.640
I've got them in assisted living.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.240
I've got assisted living leads.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.760
I've gotten golf lesson leads.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.560
I've gotten cactus removal leads.

13:08.760 --> 13:11.440
I've gotten the weirdest type of leads you could ever imagine.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.600
You can get leads.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.160
I've got them in alarm systems.

13:14.840 --> 13:19.360
We've got them in tax tax returns, CPA stuff.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.520
The the thing is, it's not black and white.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.640
Which is the case with anything in life, right?

13:25.800 --> 13:28.760
It's not are you going to get leads or not?

13:28.760 --> 13:31.040
You will get leads. It's how many leads?

13:31.040 --> 13:35.080
How how how is the juice worth the squeeze?

13:35.320 --> 13:39.640
And so no matter what industry you go into, eventually you do enough of what we teach.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.680
You're going to get leads.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.480
The question becomes, is it the best use of time?

13:43.920 --> 13:48.800
And so some of these big, scary niches, these roofing, these these

13:50.200 --> 13:54.160
plumbing, these, you know, these bigger ones, everyone wants to mention,

13:54.720 --> 13:56.720
even like electrician, whatever.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.800
They're not the move.

13:58.800 --> 13:59.760
They're not the move.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.080
They're landscaping.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.200
They're too, too, too, too, too competitive.

14:03.200 --> 14:07.480
However, if you go sub niche, there's a lot of money.

14:07.480 --> 14:11.360
And so what I want to say is, yes, there's money in there's riches in the niches.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.560
But in my opinion, you know, I've said this, I said this last call.

14:16.440 --> 14:22.040
There's there's riches in the the niche cities or the boring cities

14:22.040 --> 14:23.960
or the cities that no one thinks about.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.640
Right. And the boring niches.

14:25.640 --> 14:28.480
But there's also a lot of money in the sub niches.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.120
And so that's what we're going to be discussing today.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.640
So some niche is basically just an offshoot of a niche.

14:32.880 --> 14:36.240
So think, for example, we'll give you I'll give you an example.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.680
Roofing and roof repair.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.120
OK, roofing is the general niche.

14:41.120 --> 14:45.080
There are companies that do roofing like they go and they do roof replacements.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.680
That's where the big money's at for a lot of these companies.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.600
I have a buddy that's making millions of dollars in Myrtle Beach.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.480
A friend of mine, I know from Africa, actually,

14:54.400 --> 14:57.960
and he grew up here as well, making millions of dollars doing roofing.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.440
There's a lot of money in roof replacements.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.040
Insurance pays for it.

15:02.040 --> 15:05.640
It's you know, it's an expensive thing, but it's competitive, man.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.600
It's very, very, very, very competitive.

15:07.840 --> 15:11.920
There's also a lot of money for us in roof repair.

15:11.920 --> 15:16.640
And for these companies, roof repair is not the thing necessarily that everyone wants.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.360
It's not the thing that everyone desires.

15:18.360 --> 15:21.040
But a lot of these companies, when things get a little bit slower,

15:21.360 --> 15:23.320
they want to be able to keep their guys busy.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.880
They want to be able to send their guys out, even if they don't make that much money.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.920
They want to be able to send their guys out, fix a couple.

15:27.920 --> 15:31.400
You know, let's say it's it's a climate like here, Vegas or Phoenix.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.880
We have tile roofs.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.120
Go fix a couple tile.

15:34.120 --> 15:35.840
Boom, two, two, three hundred bucks.

15:35.840 --> 15:36.520
They pay their guy.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.880
They keep them busy while the jobs are coming in.

15:39.240 --> 15:43.600
There are other companies, the smaller guys that will typically take on

15:43.600 --> 15:47.240
just roof repairs, and they're almost more of like a roof handyman.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.360
So anyway, that is what subnitching is.

15:50.360 --> 15:54.120
OK, second thing I want to talk about, and by the way, Aaron,

15:54.120 --> 15:57.160
if you have anything you want to add on any of these points, please let me know.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.040
OK, sounds good.

15:59.560 --> 16:02.280
OK, yeah, like actually real quick, dude, on that, like this was like a year ago

16:02.280 --> 16:04.360
when I first got in the game, totally candid.

16:04.360 --> 16:08.040
I did not end up I this was a I partnered with the dude

16:08.040 --> 16:10.160
and we were doing like some crappy GMB.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.360
He had didn't end up working out in terms of getting a deal.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.680
Like I got a deal for like two weeks, totally collapsed

16:15.680 --> 16:17.280
because the GMB got suspended.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.360
Bottom line, the moral of the story for this context,

16:19.560 --> 16:21.000
I was talking with this roofer dude.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.200
This is like some 50 year old dude, a solo guy who's making bank

16:24.200 --> 16:28.400
because he's charging like 900 bucks to like put a tarp over her roof repair.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.400
So like I firsthand know like roof repair.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.480
It's insane because he's like, honestly, put a lot of times

16:34.480 --> 16:37.160
just put a tarp up and the customer is happy anyway.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.280
Crazy good.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.280
The thing I've learned about this, like talking about subnitches

16:42.280 --> 16:46.840
and all these things is that man, anything that is.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.600
The obvious stuff is never where you want to be

16:52.800 --> 16:55.320
because the obvious stuff is what everyone's doing, right?

16:55.720 --> 16:58.400
And so it always comes down to like, what's everyone doing

16:58.400 --> 17:00.480
and how do I do something different?

17:00.480 --> 17:04.760
Right. Everybody wants to get roofing leads. Right.

17:05.560 --> 17:09.440
Cool. No one wants to go do roof repair leads

17:09.880 --> 17:12.880
because it's not you don't get talked to the big companies and blah,

17:12.880 --> 17:14.240
blah, blah, blah, blah.

17:14.240 --> 17:18.680
But anything that nobody wants to do, there's money in. Right.

17:18.680 --> 17:19.800
There are people right now.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.640
That's what I've learned as I've started to travel the world.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.360
I've met people from tons of different countries,

17:25.360 --> 17:28.360
tons of different ethnicities, tons of different industries.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.400
Guys, I know millionaires in the most weirdest industries

17:33.400 --> 17:34.560
you'd ever imagine in your life.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.960
I know a guy that's very wealthy.

17:37.760 --> 17:41.680
I don't know exactly how wealthy, but this guy is he's a Lebanese guy,

17:41.680 --> 17:44.440
but he's from he's from Sierra Leone, actually,

17:44.440 --> 17:46.920
but he's he throws you off. He's Lebanese.

17:47.360 --> 17:51.360
And this dude is making his money.

17:52.360 --> 17:56.200
By taking garbage, taking plastic,

17:56.760 --> 18:01.800
and and he figured out a way to turn it into cement blocks.

18:02.320 --> 18:06.120
And he's basically it's like 30 percent cheaper. Right.

18:06.320 --> 18:10.960
So instead of just producing seem like a lot of people in Sierra Leone,

18:11.280 --> 18:13.320
they'll go and they'll start an import company. Right.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.000
They'll go and import stuff from Lebanon and import stuff from Turkey.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.360
They'll import stuff from China.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.560
And then they'll they'll sell it to the builders.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.680
They'll sell it to whatever. Right.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.080
And that there's people that make a lot of money doing that.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.760
And it's what this guy did is he's like, hey, instead of going

18:25.760 --> 18:28.680
and doing what everybody else did, I'm actually going to go

18:28.680 --> 18:31.320
and I'm going to I'm going to do building materials,

18:31.680 --> 18:34.920
but I'm going to create a building material out of all the filth on the ground.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.960
And he's he's become very, very successful doing that.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.480
He also has a separate business that he started

18:42.440 --> 18:45.960
where they take I don't know how else to say that they take shit,

18:46.440 --> 18:49.080
human shit from the dump sites.

18:49.680 --> 18:54.040
And they put it in these bags and they literally like

18:54.040 --> 18:57.160
turn it into fertilizer and he sells the fertilizer. Right.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.920
So instead of you could look at the overarching niche being,

19:01.160 --> 19:04.680
you know, garbage collector or waste removal.

19:04.880 --> 19:09.960
And he's gone sub niche and he's he's producing fertilizer. Right.

19:10.520 --> 19:15.080
What I'm getting at is that there are always I think that the move,

19:15.120 --> 19:17.080
no matter what you're doing,

19:17.080 --> 19:19.640
you always want to look for the opportunity to sub niche.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.160
And I don't care if even if you're not in lead generation,

19:22.160 --> 19:25.360
let's say that you do this business, you go and you make ten thousand bucks,

19:25.360 --> 19:28.240
you quit your job, you maybe you make twenty thousand bucks a month.

19:28.480 --> 19:32.160
It allows you to travel and you decide at twenty thousand bucks.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.720
You're going to kind of stop there

19:34.720 --> 19:36.920
and you're going to go pursue some other businesses.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.760
I think you're crazy, but you could.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.720
And, you know, whatever business you get into, I don't care what industry

19:41.720 --> 19:43.880
this is going to be applicable.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.520
I truly, truly, truly believe that no matter what industry

19:46.520 --> 19:47.600
this is going to be applicable for that.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.960
OK, so let me give you an example really quick.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.080
And one thing I want to say is that you do need to make sure

19:53.080 --> 19:55.280
that the volume is adequate.

19:55.280 --> 19:58.840
So you want to go and you want to be sub niche down,

19:59.080 --> 20:02.160
but you have to make sure that the volume is adequate.

20:02.440 --> 20:03.160
Does that make sense?

20:03.160 --> 20:07.240
So, for example, if you're going to go into roof repair in

20:08.560 --> 20:12.920
Las Vegas, Nevada, you need to make sure that even though that's a sub niche,

20:12.920 --> 20:14.360
you need to make sure there's enough volume,

20:14.360 --> 20:16.200
because as you start to go into sub niche,

20:16.400 --> 20:18.680
you're going to start getting less volume than the main niche.

20:18.680 --> 20:22.160
So as long as the volume is adequate, which that's another conversation

20:22.160 --> 20:23.880
for another day of how to discover volume.

20:23.880 --> 20:26.080
That's one of the things we talk about inside the program.

20:26.080 --> 20:30.680
But as long as the volume is adequate, you can never go wrong by sub niching. OK.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.440
I'm going to give you an example that's a little bit outside of this realm,

20:36.520 --> 20:38.920
but it worked amazing.

20:38.920 --> 20:43.520
So in 2021, I started my program, Digital Landlords,

20:43.520 --> 20:46.440
and this is applicable because who knows, maybe one day you guys have your own

20:46.440 --> 20:50.200
programs, maybe not, but this was this is very, very on point. OK.

20:51.600 --> 20:55.200
So I got some coaching from somebody.

20:55.200 --> 20:55.960
This is what I always do.

20:55.960 --> 20:59.400
Whenever I want to do something new, I go find the expert and I pay them.

20:59.480 --> 21:02.040
And in this case, I paid somebody, I think it was ten thousand bucks.

21:02.440 --> 21:07.280
And they had this training that basically showed me how to A to Z, set up my,

21:07.520 --> 21:09.600
you know, how to launch my program.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.840
Imagine they're selling a program on how to sell a program.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.720
What a genius thing to do. But I bought it. It was ten thousand bucks.

21:16.720 --> 21:17.520
I bought it.

21:17.520 --> 21:20.680
And one of the things that this person said is make sure to go niche,

21:21.520 --> 21:25.520
make sure to go very, very, very niche and speak to your exact audience

21:25.520 --> 21:28.320
that you think you're going to be solving the problem for.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.400
And so that's what I did.

21:30.400 --> 21:34.720
And so many of you will never remember this, but when I first started

21:35.720 --> 21:38.720
my program, I called it flat fee mastery. OK.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.880
And the reason I called it flat fee mastery is because at that time,

21:43.080 --> 21:46.840
all the people that I knew, all the people that I knew

21:46.840 --> 21:49.920
that were in this business from other groups, they were people

21:49.920 --> 21:53.840
who had already been in other programs and they knew how to build a website.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.520
They knew how to generate leads.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.680
They just didn't know how to sell.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.600
And specifically, they didn't know how to sell a flat fee deal.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.240
They couldn't even fathom selling a flat fee.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.080
I was getting messages all the time, dude, I can't get anyone

22:06.080 --> 22:07.280
to do anything besides commission.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.040
How are you selling flat fee deals?

22:09.040 --> 22:12.040
So I'm like, dude, I'm going to be teaching people who are already

22:12.040 --> 22:14.800
in other programs, and I'm just going to be teaching the sales side.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.520
I'm not even going to be talking about the SEO.

22:16.520 --> 22:17.840
I'm just going to be talking about sales.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.520
And I'm going to be talking specifically about how to do flat fee.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.760
And so guess what, guys?

22:22.760 --> 22:25.360
I called my program flat fee mastery.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.160
And guess what?

22:27.160 --> 22:30.160
Our free group up until two weeks ago, I think.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.960
When do we change the name of the free group, Aaron?

22:32.960 --> 22:34.040
Just two weeks ago.

22:34.040 --> 22:34.800
Yeah.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.360
A week ago, two weeks ago.

22:36.360 --> 22:38.960
It was called the art of pre-selling.

22:39.960 --> 22:40.920
What does that even mean?

22:40.920 --> 22:42.640
That doesn't even make sense to anyone.

22:42.640 --> 22:46.400
Like, I was the worst name for a group to try to attract people

22:46.400 --> 22:49.160
into this business that have never done it.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.280
The art of pre-selling makes no sense.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.720
It makes total sense, though, if you're already in the business

22:54.720 --> 22:58.240
and you are like, you know, you've built websites,

22:58.240 --> 23:00.600
you've waited six months and you're frustrated, right?

23:01.240 --> 23:03.960
But because I thought I was talking to an audience

23:03.960 --> 23:06.560
that had already been in the space, I didn't care.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.800
Point being, guys, I targeted.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.920
Let me tell you how narrow I went.

23:12.720 --> 23:18.240
And, you know, the first like snitch is I went not just into general business,

23:18.760 --> 23:20.480
but I went into marketing, right?

23:20.480 --> 23:22.800
So there's all kinds of different business and then there's marketing.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.200
But I didn't just go into marketing.

23:25.200 --> 23:29.880
I went into, you know, lead generation specifically

23:29.880 --> 23:31.960
inside the umbrella of marketing, lead generation.

23:31.960 --> 23:34.920
And inside of lead generation, I went into local lead generation.

23:34.920 --> 23:39.760
And inside of locally generation, I went into locally generation using organic.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.880
And inside of that, like there were so many levels.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.920
And inside of that, I went into

23:46.160 --> 23:48.200
specifically flat fee

23:49.400 --> 23:51.400
lead generation by building.

23:51.400 --> 23:55.360
I mean, I was so niche that in my head, I was terrified

23:55.360 --> 23:59.440
because I thought I was going to exclude all these people by going that niche.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.320
And guess what, guys, I did the exact opposite thing.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.800
And when you become when you go niche.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.640
You become the expert, OK?

24:06.640 --> 24:09.080
We've all heard, like, for example,

24:09.080 --> 24:12.600
right now, I'm looking at investing in some property in another country.

24:13.240 --> 24:16.080
And I am having the hardest time

24:16.480 --> 24:21.200
finding somebody that's an attorney or a CPA, not an attorney, a CPA

24:22.760 --> 24:25.920
that specializes or has knowledge and experience

24:26.240 --> 24:31.360
on real estate in another country, specifically in West Africa.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.520
OK, and more to come on that.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.520
But if any of you guys have any ideas of somebody, don't waste my time, please.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.280
But if you do, I'd be really grateful.

24:38.280 --> 24:41.840
The only person that we found, we found one person and they charge

24:42.080 --> 24:43.880
some insane amount of money.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.760
I think it was over a thousand dollars per hour

24:47.640 --> 24:52.120
to just consult, just to consult over some ridiculous.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.440
It was enough that I couldn't even I couldn't even like

24:55.040 --> 24:55.880
I couldn't even wrap my head around.

24:55.880 --> 24:56.880
I'm like, what?

24:56.880 --> 25:00.080
Like, I just need you to tell me if I can depreciate this and if it's the same

25:00.360 --> 25:02.400
and how it's going to look and all this different stuff.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.480
And and and that's that's what happens, guys.

25:05.640 --> 25:08.960
When you become the expert in tiny sub niches,

25:09.240 --> 25:13.120
that's where all the money is. OK, so I would love to see somebody

25:13.120 --> 25:15.520
because I see people all the time on the roofing local.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.720
I'm the lead generator leads for roofing.

25:18.440 --> 25:21.480
I know I haven't seen roof repair lead generator.

25:22.080 --> 25:24.360
OK, I haven't seen that.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.840
I have not seen the roof repair lead generator.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.920
And the reason why is because people are too scared to go sub niche.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.920
But that's where all the freaking money is. OK.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.760
So, Aaron, anything you want to add to that?

25:36.040 --> 25:38.080
No, it's on point. OK, let's keep going.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.320
Real quick, I'm not going to waste too much time on this.

25:41.320 --> 25:44.920
But the reason I got into this, guys, is because I was an idiot.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.000
That's what most most of the stuff I teach you guys,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.720
most of the stuff I've learned is come by me being an idiot

25:50.320 --> 25:51.520
and doing the wrong thing.

25:51.520 --> 25:55.920
And basically what happened to cut a very long, multiple year,

25:56.240 --> 25:59.440
multiple millions of dollars mistake

25:59.920 --> 26:04.520
is I went into industries that were massive and got my butt kicked.

26:05.600 --> 26:06.960
I went into roofing.

26:06.960 --> 26:10.080
I went into I tried alarm systems.

26:10.400 --> 26:13.560
I went into CPA.

26:13.920 --> 26:18.240
I went into a space and waterproofing water.

26:18.240 --> 26:21.040
Oh, my gosh, I got my butt handed to me

26:21.040 --> 26:25.040
out of silver platter and waterproofing foundation repair right there with it.

26:25.320 --> 26:28.000
Landscaping, all of the stuff.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.600
I wouldn't even I wouldn't even waste my time doing a due diligence

26:31.600 --> 26:32.480
on any of these niches.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.600
Like I wouldn't waste five seconds on any of this stuff.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.880
And I built tens.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.160
Of in each of these niches, probably.

26:42.440 --> 26:47.760
I'd say probably over 50 sites in those niches I just mentioned combined.

26:47.960 --> 26:51.320
No more, because just in waterproofing the foundation repair alone, about 50,

26:51.480 --> 26:54.320
I would say close to 100.

26:54.320 --> 26:56.760
In the wrong niches, in these big niches.

26:56.760 --> 27:00.520
So just so you guys know, you don't have to believe me.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.760
You guys can go and see if the stove is hot yourself, because I understand

27:04.760 --> 27:06.440
that's what you have to do sometimes.

27:06.440 --> 27:10.800
But even if you can get that city and you can get that partnership

27:10.800 --> 27:15.120
and you're like, no, I figured it out, guys, we're talking about scaling.

27:15.120 --> 27:15.640
And guess what?

27:15.680 --> 27:19.080
I've also had one or two good partnerships in these industries.

27:19.480 --> 27:21.400
But the point is, it's not repeatable.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.760
It's not something that I can duplicate.

27:22.760 --> 27:23.560
And that's the issue.

27:23.560 --> 27:28.480
OK, so that's that's really the reality is that you guys can either listen

27:28.480 --> 27:31.440
to what I'm saying or you can go try it yourself.

27:31.880 --> 27:36.040
And hopefully you guys are smart enough that you can look at my mistakes and go,

27:36.040 --> 27:38.280
all right, let's just listen to Nick.

27:38.280 --> 27:42.440
OK, that's why I wanted to start off by telling you my my experience

27:42.440 --> 27:44.400
so you didn't have to go touch the stove yourself.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.600
OK, a couple of examples of stub niches.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.840
You know, we could talk about instead of roofing,

27:51.840 --> 27:55.400
we could talk about roof repair instead of landscaping.

27:55.400 --> 28:01.320
There's landscape design instead of electrician.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.320
We could I don't even know what the term for this is,

28:03.320 --> 28:08.560
but you could target just the electrical conversion for electrical vehicles.

28:08.560 --> 28:11.560
I've done it twice in two of my no, I did it once.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.040
Sorry, I got a quote on both houses

28:15.040 --> 28:18.400
and realized my house was already equipped for it because I had an RV garage.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.760
But I've literally called.

28:22.360 --> 28:25.760
I've gone to Google and typed in like Tesla

28:26.080 --> 28:30.360
electrician for Tesla charger electrician for electric car.

28:31.760 --> 28:33.920
Do you know what that's called, Aaron, that conversion process?

28:34.480 --> 28:37.040
I do not. OK, that's exactly right.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.480
That's a niche. That's really sub niche.

28:39.520 --> 28:41.040
And if you go into a big enough city

28:41.040 --> 28:44.520
and you're just getting leads for electric, I mean, I'm sitting here

28:44.520 --> 28:46.120
thinking I shouldn't have said that out loud.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.240
That's a good niche.

28:47.240 --> 28:50.560
Right. The electrical cars are only getting more popular.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.760
I again, I've already had to call.

28:52.760 --> 28:57.400
It's my second time I've had a Tesla and my brother's got one.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.360
I mean, these things are getting in.

28:59.360 --> 29:00.720
It's not just Tesla's now, right?

29:00.720 --> 29:02.240
It's it's all electrical vehicles.

29:02.240 --> 29:07.200
You have to have a special current flowing to the charger to have.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.160
Otherwise, it takes like 24 hours.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.960
It's ridiculous if you just do the regular charger, the 12 volt, whatever.

29:12.760 --> 29:15.400
That's a sub niche inside of electric. I've never done it. OK.

29:16.200 --> 29:21.240
Inside of plumbing, you have what's it called? Sewage.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.520
What am I thinking of, Aaron?

29:25.520 --> 29:30.040
Inside of inside of plumbing, septic, septic removal, I think it is.

29:30.520 --> 29:34.520
Yes, septic tank septic is septic tank removal or septic tank.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.880
Something like that. I know something septic.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.120
I've never done it. I've never done it.

29:40.200 --> 29:43.520
Instead of masonry, you can go into specific things

29:43.920 --> 29:46.920
like block walls, which I'm going to show you today.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.280
Guys, there any niche you're in right now, there's a sub niche.

29:53.440 --> 29:56.760
Inside of inside of concrete, there's two different niches, right?

29:56.760 --> 30:00.080
There's there's flat work, which is what everyone does.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.120
There's decorative, which is what some people do.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.160
And inside of decorative, guess what?

30:05.160 --> 30:09.440
There's another sub niche called cool decking, cool decking.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.640
They go, I did it in my house.

30:11.640 --> 30:15.000
Your your your frickin cement is a million degrees.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.960
Your kids are burning their feet. They come. They lay this nice coat.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.480
They put some flakes on it, kind of looks like an epoxy.

30:20.800 --> 30:21.880
It's called cool decking.

30:21.880 --> 30:25.200
You could just do cool decking leads. And that's two layers deep.

30:25.200 --> 30:27.840
You got concrete, then you got decorative concrete, then you got cool decking.

30:28.240 --> 30:32.120
OK, any niche that you're in that I promise you there's a sub niche.

30:32.120 --> 30:35.040
And that doesn't mean it's always good that, like, for example,

30:35.040 --> 30:38.400
tree service, you could specifically target stump removal.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.040
That's not the move, in my opinion, because stump removal,

30:41.040 --> 30:44.400
there's not that much money in relative to tree service.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.720
But if you were the best at it, and I bet you if you built a stump

30:47.720 --> 30:52.480
removal website, you would outrank the best companies in any city

30:52.480 --> 30:54.520
because nobody's targeting stump removal.

30:54.880 --> 30:56.840
I'd have to run the numbers. I'd have to really figure it out.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.920
And I'm not sure that every company wants stump stump removals.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.400
But that's what I'm saying, guys.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.880
I don't care what it is.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.520
There is an opportunity inside of artificial grass.

31:08.520 --> 31:11.080
There's people that are just searching for artificial grass

31:11.440 --> 31:14.600
for specific things, right? Artificial grass, there's

31:16.560 --> 31:19.400
there's artificial grass for your pets, right?

31:22.160 --> 31:24.960
Pet friendly artificial grass.

31:25.680 --> 31:29.480
Right, there's also a sub niche of of artificial grass.

31:30.040 --> 31:33.200
You know, you could target people that are that are doing like

31:33.960 --> 31:36.600
bigger projects. I wouldn't target big commercial projects,

31:36.600 --> 31:39.840
but you could target different types of projects, right?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.560
You just have to get creative.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.280
Even like fencing, huh?

31:43.280 --> 31:45.960
Like even like fencing, I know that that's kind of starting to get

31:45.960 --> 31:49.680
a bit more popular, kind of an untapped niche, super relevant, obviously.

31:49.680 --> 31:51.400
But like when you think about fencing,

31:51.400 --> 31:53.400
there's like dozens of different types of fences.

31:53.400 --> 31:57.880
So you could go wide, horizontal, right, or vertical and one specific niche

31:57.880 --> 32:03.200
within that niche of chain link fence, wooden fence, barbed wire fence, you know?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.240
Yeah, 100 percent.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.320
Another thing I was thinking of is roofing, right?

32:08.520 --> 32:11.280
So obviously, there's roof repair, but there's also metal roofing.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.560
Right. There's specific roofing.

32:15.680 --> 32:19.600
There's I'm sure there's I don't know what it is after the research,

32:19.600 --> 32:21.760
but I know that Tesla or Sun's

32:23.520 --> 32:25.880
Sun City, is that what it's called?

32:25.880 --> 32:27.840
Is that what it's called? Sun City?

32:28.440 --> 32:31.040
Is that Elon Musk's solar company?

32:31.040 --> 32:32.560
I don't know.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.440
Bro, that's going to bug me.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.240
I think it's Sun City.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.600
Yeah, it is. Hold on.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.600
I just have to, you know.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.840
Everyone wants to know as much as I do.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.800
What is it? Why am I having?

32:47.880 --> 32:50.280
Oh, someone said solar city, I think.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.080
Solar City, Sun City.

32:52.080 --> 32:53.960
Thank you, Discord user.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.200
Discord user, thank you.

32:56.920 --> 33:00.080
Point being, guys, there's always a sub niche, and that's the reality.

33:00.080 --> 33:06.040
OK, so I just want you guys to know if, you know,

33:06.040 --> 33:08.240
we've talked about going vertical like we did last week,

33:08.240 --> 33:11.440
but I want you guys to really consider going sub niche.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.160
Every single niche, there's a sub niche.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.600
I don't care what it is.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.520
I wouldn't do this one.

33:17.520 --> 33:20.160
But for example, I know that there's a niche called cell phone repair.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.680
I promise you that there's a way to go sub niche in that.

33:23.680 --> 33:26.640
You could go with iPhone cell phone repair.

33:27.080 --> 33:30.080
And to be honest, I bet you that there's way more people that do that anyway.

33:30.320 --> 33:33.360
But every single niche, there is a sub niche.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.480
And that, I believe, is where the money's at.

33:35.480 --> 33:38.240
The reason why it's good and where there's a lot of money

33:38.240 --> 33:40.480
in taking big niches and then going sub niche

33:41.440 --> 33:44.160
is because typically the big niches are more competitive

33:44.160 --> 33:46.200
and the sub niches are not.

33:46.200 --> 33:50.080
And when you get into the less known niches and then you sub niche,

33:50.120 --> 33:52.280
the only thing you need to be careful of is you need to make sure

33:52.280 --> 33:53.320
there's adequate search volume.

33:53.320 --> 33:56.600
OK, so real quick, guys, I'm going to share my screen.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.720
I'll show you guys one thing really quick.

33:59.840 --> 34:02.040
And then we're going to Q&A. OK, I'm going to try.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.880
Am I got host, by the way, or cohost, at least.

34:06.640 --> 34:07.640
Aaron.

34:10.760 --> 34:12.440
Sorry, yeah, you should be good now.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.760
OK, let me see. Where the heck did my window go?

34:15.560 --> 34:17.200
Hang tight, brother.

34:17.200 --> 34:18.920
Where's my?

34:20.400 --> 34:21.560
OK, there we go.

34:21.560 --> 34:26.040
All right, let me go ahead and do screen share.

34:27.280 --> 34:30.320
Except for I don't know why it's not letting me got this update on.

34:33.320 --> 34:34.320
Hold on.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.480
All right, there we go.

34:38.480 --> 34:43.000
More. Dude, I don't know why it's not letting me screen share.

34:43.960 --> 34:47.200
Can you I'm cohost for sure, right?

34:47.800 --> 34:50.880
Yeah, and I have all participants enabled for sharing.

34:52.400 --> 34:55.520
Weird, I wonder if it's because I'm inside of Safari,

34:55.520 --> 34:57.840
which I believe is garbage.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.200
It actually doesn't give me the option.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.600
I know you're I know everyone's probably thinking, oh, it's the button.

35:02.560 --> 35:05.560
Every single button I click on, there's not an option to go.

35:05.560 --> 35:07.520
It's weird. You want to send me the link and I'll quickly.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.400
Yeah, you can look it up for me.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.680
So, OK, cool.

35:10.680 --> 35:13.760
What I want to show you guys, well, number one, just go to

35:15.120 --> 35:16.640
go to roofing.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.640
This is I want to show you guys really quick, a quick, easy way

35:18.880 --> 35:21.560
to look at some issues, just kind of like roofing plus a big city.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.800
Do you like roofing?

35:23.800 --> 35:26.320
Chicago, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Chicago.

35:26.440 --> 35:27.920
Doesn't matter to Chicago.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.600
I'm a Chicago guy. All right.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.040
Go to the top. Organic. All right.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.720
Champion roofing. Beautiful.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.240
I think I've heard of them, but through my research.

35:38.720 --> 35:41.200
And then I want you to just look at the services.

35:42.080 --> 35:44.160
All right. Services.

35:45.400 --> 35:48.000
I hope pop ups for days.

35:48.240 --> 35:50.440
So residential, we got. Oh, man, look at this.

35:50.440 --> 35:54.720
There you go. So you could do roof, you know.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.200
So these guys actually, this is a little bit different

35:57.200 --> 35:59.440
because these guys are going sub niche.

36:00.080 --> 36:03.280
These I technically could argue that these aren't necessarily roofing.

36:03.480 --> 36:04.640
This is some examples, right?

36:04.640 --> 36:07.000
You have roof replacement. That's the big daddy.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.800
You have gutters, which is a sub niche off of roofing.

36:09.800 --> 36:13.720
By the way, I've made a lot of money on gutter installation, gutter cleaning.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.400
There's not a ton of money in.

36:15.400 --> 36:16.560
They're adding masonry in here.

36:16.560 --> 36:17.920
I don't think that's the greatest thing.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.720
Siding is kind of like a whatever.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.120
Let's go to another. Let's go to the next result.

36:22.120 --> 36:26.080
I think these guys are kind of these guys are kind of shiny penny, in my opinion.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.960
But here I ranking number one.

36:29.960 --> 36:32.600
Oh, roof inspections, custom designers.

36:32.600 --> 36:35.760
I didn't think of those that design roof design.

36:35.760 --> 36:36.960
Never thought of that.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.680
Root residential roof repair residents.

36:39.680 --> 36:43.360
They're targeting just residential commercial roof.

36:43.360 --> 36:46.040
I didn't know what that is. Infrared.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.120
I don't know.

37:09.120 --> 37:10.120
And then.

37:16.240 --> 37:19.320
And every single one of these sub niches would shake roof system.

37:19.520 --> 37:23.520
Hilarious metal roof system, slate roof system, clay tile.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.800
Unbelievable. OK, Aaron, I want you to go.

37:25.800 --> 37:28.320
I want to give you guys an example of a quick before we get on this off.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.120
So hold on one second.

37:30.120 --> 37:32.520
You can just keep this window open like this, guys.

37:33.920 --> 37:37.520
One of the very first deals I got when I got back into Legion,

37:37.520 --> 37:40.320
because you guys know that maybe you don't.

37:40.320 --> 37:43.240
But when I got back, I got in this business.

37:43.240 --> 37:45.320
I got a couple of deals. I got shiny penny syndrome.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.920
I, you know, whatever.

37:46.920 --> 37:49.240
And out of necessity, I had to get back into this business.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.920
And I came back and I started doing SEO because I needed quick cash.

37:52.440 --> 37:55.280
And once I realized that SEO wasn't going to scale,

37:56.080 --> 38:00.080
I think it may have been the very first website I ever sold doing regeneration

38:00.080 --> 38:02.840
when I finally realized, oh, my gosh, this is where the money's at.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.240
Was a sub niche of masonry.

38:05.240 --> 38:07.440
So I want you to go and I want you to type in St.

38:07.440 --> 38:10.760
George Block Wall just in the in the let's see how the suckers ranking.

38:10.760 --> 38:12.920
I haven't logged into this in a long time, dude.

38:13.520 --> 38:14.320
All right. St.

38:14.320 --> 38:15.800
George Block Wall.

38:15.800 --> 38:17.960
OK. Oh, still ranking number one.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.840
Hello. Top one.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.720
Let's see me.

38:21.720 --> 38:23.320
I know that I can tell.

38:23.320 --> 38:25.240
Look at this thing. This is a beauty.

38:25.240 --> 38:27.240
OK, so St. George Block Wall.

38:27.240 --> 38:30.400
I built this thing. You can even go to who is go look at who is, bro.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.000
I think it's going to show you. I bought this in 2019.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.760
I think I should have been.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.320
Go look at it really quick. Look me up.

38:37.320 --> 38:39.000
And while you do that, I'm going to get my stripe account

38:39.000 --> 38:41.800
and tell you how much money I've made from this one.

38:42.400 --> 38:43.880
I don't even.

38:43.880 --> 38:45.760
Is it who is domain?

38:45.760 --> 38:48.520
Yeah. Do you have SEO quick on your toolbar?

38:48.520 --> 38:50.560
I don't. OK, don't worry about it.

38:50.560 --> 38:53.480
But anyway, I was going to just prove to you guys that I.

38:53.480 --> 38:55.400
Oh, and I'm not even logged in on Stripe on this computer.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.520
So my laptop, never mind.

38:56.520 --> 38:59.160
I know for a fact, I've made over twenty thousand dollars.

38:59.160 --> 39:00.840
Go back to the website.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.440
Is it right there?

39:02.440 --> 39:04.360
I'd have to figure it out.

39:04.360 --> 39:06.760
I don't know. It's not that relevant.

39:06.760 --> 39:07.880
So go back to the website.

39:07.880 --> 39:11.280
This website right here, dinky freaking website ever has.

39:11.280 --> 39:14.240
I know for a fact, if not, it's probably closer to 30,

39:14.240 --> 39:18.360
but I can with 100 percent confidence say I know it's made me over.

39:18.360 --> 39:21.520
It's made me for sure over twenty thousand dollars. OK.

39:21.520 --> 39:24.160
And you know what the best part about this is, Aaron,

39:24.160 --> 39:27.480
is that the person that I was selling these leads to for twelve hundred dollars

39:27.480 --> 39:30.240
a month for over a year and a half,

39:30.240 --> 39:33.160
they're still paying me for a different set of leads.

39:33.160 --> 39:36.880
But this person ended up joining their part of digital landlords.

39:36.880 --> 39:40.440
The business owner of this of this is a digital landlord.

39:40.440 --> 39:43.560
They decided they're like, dude, I love doing what I do.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.720
They make like I think they make like seven million dollars a year.

39:45.720 --> 39:48.000
Their company does. They don't even do block wall.

39:48.000 --> 39:54.120
They do stucco and they wanted to start learning how to do this

39:54.120 --> 39:57.240
because they wanted to not have to be stuck to their city.

39:57.240 --> 40:00.240
So it's it's it's hilarious how this works.

40:00.240 --> 40:02.360
Anyway, this thing's made me over twenty thousand dollars.

40:02.360 --> 40:07.440
And we're talking about not just masonry, we're talking about block wall.

40:07.600 --> 40:10.760
There's I would say the majority of cities in America.

40:10.760 --> 40:14.040
You wouldn't even know what I was talking about because it's it's

40:14.040 --> 40:17.200
the ugliest fence in the world, but for its climates like Vegas,

40:17.200 --> 40:21.280
St. George, Utah, Phoenix, Arizona, they make us put these ratchet

40:21.280 --> 40:23.560
looking block walls like we're in a prison.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.280
And it's just the way that people do it.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.960
And so I went sub niche.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.840
This thing was making me over twelve hundred dollars.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.320
I think we ended up doing it.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.920
It's like eight hundred dollars a month now, but this thing's ranking so well.

40:32.920 --> 40:35.720
I don't think we even have to run much ads, if any at all.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.920
These sites, these pictures are garbage.

40:38.240 --> 40:42.400
Some of these pictures actually go down a little bit like those ones right there.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.320
I actually that top right one, Francesc and the bottom right one.

40:46.480 --> 40:49.240
Francesca actually took that photo.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.240
She actually drove to a job site, took that photo.

40:51.240 --> 40:52.680
So that's insane.

40:52.680 --> 40:56.560
So, you know, guys, what's cool about that is within that within block wall.

40:56.960 --> 40:59.400
I mean, obviously, as Nick was talking about, if you go to niche,

40:59.400 --> 41:02.520
then there's not enough volume, it's too targeted, it's too specialized.

41:03.320 --> 41:06.680
But now even within here, there's even sub niches within block wall.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.720
Now it's low competitive enough where you can get all those sub niches

41:09.720 --> 41:11.880
within the sub niche of block wall.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.880
It just goes to show it's an endless combination.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.760
Cinder block retaining wall in Vegas.

41:16.760 --> 41:18.640
Dude, I'm making I mean, dude, you can go.

41:18.640 --> 41:21.000
And again, sub niche in big cities works.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.680
OK, we got five minutes.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.720
You can un-share this just to give you guys an example.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.600
And let's go through a couple of questions really quick.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.880
And we had a couple of people.

41:28.880 --> 41:33.040
So this was this was from Christopher.

41:33.080 --> 41:34.680
This was in earlier what you were talking about.

41:34.680 --> 41:37.920
He said, thought I'd saw you made some big money in basement waterproofing.

41:37.960 --> 41:40.640
I think that was a YouTube video you did like last year that talked about.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.680
You got a deal that got lucky, right.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.440
And then, OK, that's right.

41:44.440 --> 41:46.080
You can go into it if you want.

41:46.080 --> 41:47.480
It's competitive, bro.

41:47.480 --> 41:49.800
Very, very. You can make money, just not.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.680
You can make more money elsewhere.

41:51.680 --> 41:53.560
I don't think it's worth the squeeze. That's just my opinion.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.280
I'm going to I'm going to do rapid fire on these Q&A.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.440
Keep going. Cool.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.040
Jen said, would you please repeat the niches?

41:58.040 --> 41:59.600
You said you got your butt kicked in real quick.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.760
I'll we'll be putting this in that cheat sheet real quick.

42:02.760 --> 42:05.800
But I mean, you talk about like roofing, basement waterproofing.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.400
There's like two others there.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.160
Solar.

42:11.760 --> 42:14.040
Alarm systems, CPA.

42:14.280 --> 42:20.600
Yeah, I mean, dude, just anything that plumbing HVAC,

42:20.600 --> 42:24.200
anything that's just very obvious is competitive.

42:24.760 --> 42:25.960
OK, for sure.

42:25.960 --> 42:30.000
And then, yeah, Jason mentioned flat roofing, roofing tile repair,

42:30.160 --> 42:32.960
just as some niches within roofing, which is 100 percent right on.

42:33.840 --> 42:35.760
And then Jensen, what do you charge for St.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.960
George Blackwall? You says a thousand or twelve hundred.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.560
It was twelve hundred when I started.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.480
I think our current time, I wanted to log into my start.

42:41.480 --> 42:43.200
Oh, actually, I might be able to hold on.

42:46.400 --> 42:47.800
Keep going. And I'm going to look this up.

42:47.800 --> 42:49.480
I'll come back. I'm going to see if I can find it real quick.

42:49.480 --> 42:50.400
OK, yeah. She says.

42:50.400 --> 42:51.880
Or what did you charge in the beginning?

42:51.880 --> 42:55.360
I don't know if this is still an active deal you have, but let's see.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.840
No, I still do. I think it's 800 now, by the way.

42:58.560 --> 43:02.480
I just opened up Stripe and I love it's not much.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.400
But I just as well, I was sleeping even better.

43:05.400 --> 43:07.360
I made one hundred and fifty bucks sleeping last night.

43:07.400 --> 43:08.720
That's kind of cool.

43:08.720 --> 43:10.160
That's for epoxy, by the way.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.440
So keep going.

43:11.440 --> 43:15.360
I just had to just every time I see it, it just makes me happy.

43:15.880 --> 43:18.760
For sure. Jaleel says quick question for later.

43:18.960 --> 43:22.000
How one would you introduce yourself to a prospect when cold calling?

43:22.000 --> 43:24.320
If they don't ask, what's your connection to the lead?

43:24.560 --> 43:27.520
So, Jaleel, if you are you talking about like when you call the lead,

43:27.680 --> 43:31.480
we just called your your phone number or the business owner who you're prospecting.

43:32.520 --> 43:33.960
Because we can give you a quick little answer.

43:33.960 --> 43:34.760
That's a next.

43:34.760 --> 43:36.000
Make some YouTube videos on that.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.680
But it's a good question.

43:37.680 --> 43:39.160
We can quickly address that.

43:39.160 --> 43:42.400
Shane Noble says, do the business owner.

43:42.400 --> 43:45.800
So, yeah, what you do is and Nick actually has a couple of videos on this,

43:45.800 --> 43:48.920
but you pretty much you almost act like the customer start

43:49.120 --> 43:50.200
because you got to get your foot in the door.

43:50.200 --> 43:52.760
You can't just say, hey, are you interested in concrete leads?

43:52.760 --> 43:55.800
You got to say, hey, do you guys do concrete in XYZ city?

43:55.800 --> 43:57.720
Right. Kind of make it sound like you live there. Right.

43:57.720 --> 44:01.000
And then they're going to be you keep going on like, OK, do you do cover the zip code?

44:01.000 --> 44:02.640
You can even get specific. Right.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.640
And then they'll probably ask like, OK, so is this for you or like, yeah,

44:05.640 --> 44:08.400
we can give you a free estimate next week or whatever the case may be.

44:08.720 --> 44:11.200
And that's when you transition to like, oh, it's not for me.

44:11.400 --> 44:14.800
I just got this guy, Bob, who's looking to have a new driveway installed

44:14.800 --> 44:17.520
and just want to make sure it's something you do before wasted any of your time.

44:17.520 --> 44:19.200
Right. And then they don't know what to think.

44:19.200 --> 44:21.400
Or is this a referral friend or whatever?

44:21.640 --> 44:25.400
Now you kind of got some open time before they just click hang up on you.

44:25.720 --> 44:28.640
And that's when you transition to, hey, man, so I got these leads coming in.

44:28.760 --> 44:30.600
I'm looking for someone to send them to.

44:30.600 --> 44:32.360
I wasn't happy to give you a couple for free.

44:32.360 --> 44:34.960
And then all I ask is just later have a conversation

44:34.960 --> 44:37.240
to see about an ongoing partnership.

44:37.240 --> 44:39.920
Like, in short, that's the cold call. Right.

44:39.920 --> 44:42.160
So good. Obviously, there's variables.

44:42.160 --> 44:44.200
But by the way, real quick, I just looked it up.

44:44.200 --> 44:45.840
I just text Francesca about St. George.

44:45.840 --> 44:47.600
But I know we have a couple of different websites

44:47.600 --> 44:49.360
specifically targeting block wall.

44:49.360 --> 44:51.040
And one of them were making three hundred dollars a week.

44:51.040 --> 44:52.960
One of them were making two hundred and twelve dollars a week

44:52.960 --> 44:54.040
just to kind of put it in context.

44:54.040 --> 44:55.120
So there's money in it.

44:55.120 --> 44:56.160
There's definitely money.

44:56.160 --> 44:58.080
Let's go through a couple more. For sure.

44:58.080 --> 45:01.360
So, yeah, Shane says, do you do service pages when you do sub niches?

45:02.120 --> 45:04.160
Yeah. Look at my St. George block wall.

45:04.160 --> 45:08.200
Yeah. It was like cinder blocks, retaining walls, brick masonry, stone mason.

45:08.200 --> 45:09.960
Like all these are block wall related.

45:09.960 --> 45:11.360
I always do a couple of service pages.

45:11.360 --> 45:14.280
I usually do three to five service pages no matter what. Right.

45:15.040 --> 45:15.840
Just helps with ranking.

45:15.840 --> 45:19.240
Plus you get more leads for a bigger piece of the pie.

45:19.240 --> 45:22.440
So. All right. And then Jose says, I already have a roofing site and GMB.

45:22.600 --> 45:25.760
If I change that to roof repair only, well, I mess everything up.

45:26.120 --> 45:28.640
Yeah. With GMB, especially.

45:28.640 --> 45:32.520
Yeah. And it's not so it keep the domain the same,

45:32.520 --> 45:34.800
but you're going to have to go change your title.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.800
You're going to get your page title, your meta description,

45:37.800 --> 45:40.520
all your bolded stuff, your categories, your service pages.

45:40.840 --> 45:43.600
You're better off just starting fresh.

45:43.600 --> 45:46.360
But if the question is, do you already have leads coming in

45:46.360 --> 45:47.600
or are you just trying to write games?

45:47.600 --> 45:50.720
If you have leads coming in and you figured out a rank by all means,

45:51.000 --> 45:53.200
we're trying to avoid having a bunch of extra work.

45:53.200 --> 45:57.000
But if you've been like me and you're dumb enough that you kept doing it

45:57.960 --> 46:00.560
and you ranked great, there's money in it.

46:00.560 --> 46:02.560
It's just it's not worth the squeeze. Right.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.680
For sure. This is like one more question from Jen.

46:06.240 --> 46:08.760
She says, how many leads do you get for the block wall sites?

46:08.760 --> 46:10.440
Interested in how that relates to pricing?

46:10.440 --> 46:13.040
Real quick, I can obviously you'll toss in your two cents.

46:13.040 --> 46:16.360
But we typically like to when this actually what you teach, Nick.

46:16.360 --> 46:18.160
But like when you look at the lead value calculator,

46:18.160 --> 46:21.760
you go to like MyLeadCalculator.com, whatever we want to price stuff

46:21.760 --> 46:26.160
so that at the low the worst case scenario or like on a minimum,

46:26.160 --> 46:28.040
we want to at least double or at least triple their profit.

46:28.040 --> 46:30.120
Right. Like on the low end, be conservative.

46:30.120 --> 46:32.840
And so all you got to do that, it's really not a pay per lead basis.

46:32.840 --> 46:35.400
Obviously, I mean, you can do the calculation. Right.

46:35.640 --> 46:37.600
But with stuff like this, generally speaking,

46:37.600 --> 46:40.040
that concrete artificial grass, bigotry service jobs,

46:40.480 --> 46:42.960
if Nick correct me if I'm wrong, generally 10 to 15 leads

46:43.240 --> 46:46.080
is like kind of what you got to aim for to charge at least

46:46.080 --> 46:48.400
a thousand fifteen hundred a month.

46:48.400 --> 46:51.000
Yeah, as long as the niche, as long as they're making,

46:51.280 --> 46:55.240
you know, roughly, I would say with block wall, maybe slightly more.

46:56.400 --> 47:00.560
But yeah, it all just depends on the size of the niche, the profit margins.

47:00.560 --> 47:03.440
And yeah, the rule of thumb is we want to at least double

47:04.040 --> 47:05.640
on a conservative with a conservative number.

47:05.640 --> 47:07.400
But yeah, I never give guarantees.

47:07.400 --> 47:11.520
And typically my websites, I kind of like even though I don't say it out loud,

47:11.520 --> 47:14.040
I kind of lead them to believe like we're not going to get any more

47:14.040 --> 47:15.480
than 10 to 15 leads tops.

47:15.480 --> 47:17.120
And then I go in and I smash it for him.

47:17.120 --> 47:19.360
I know that site gets like

47:19.360 --> 47:21.760
30 leads a month. It has been for a while.

47:21.920 --> 47:24.040
And I know that because it's been I've had that I've had.

47:24.160 --> 47:26.680
I've had to change clients because my client joined my program

47:26.680 --> 47:29.480
and stopped by my leads, which is ironic.

47:29.680 --> 47:30.960
But I replaced them.

47:30.960 --> 47:34.160
And we've had that site go lives in 2019.

47:35.120 --> 47:37.240
Awesome, dude. One more question.

47:37.240 --> 47:40.200
Yeah. So Shane has to hop off.

47:40.200 --> 47:42.320
Great to have you on, Shane.

47:42.880 --> 47:45.880
Trey says, what do you tell the lead when you don't have the business

47:45.880 --> 47:47.520
to say you work with for?

47:47.520 --> 47:48.680
That's a great question, Trey.

47:48.680 --> 47:52.200
Usually just Nick always says this, like, take control,

47:52.200 --> 47:53.160
tell them what they want to hear.

47:53.160 --> 47:55.600
So when you answer, just you move the process along.

47:55.640 --> 47:59.000
You're the one who is controlling things like, hey, Bob, so I missed a call.

47:59.080 --> 48:00.880
We missed a call. You're looking for a concrete estimate.

48:00.880 --> 48:03.920
Like, yeah. So like, OK, what I'm going to do is I'm going to quickly get your info.

48:04.520 --> 48:06.000
The business owner, he's on the field right now.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.880
But later today, when he's available,

48:07.880 --> 48:10.440
we're going to call you back and that way we can schedule an estimate.

48:10.440 --> 48:12.200
Right. And that's when you'll do the three way.

48:12.200 --> 48:13.720
Just use the term business owner.

48:13.720 --> 48:16.200
You don't need to box yourself in. OK.

48:16.360 --> 48:18.160
Aaron, real quick, before we get to the last question,

48:18.160 --> 48:20.200
I want you to share the digital landlords application link.

48:20.200 --> 48:22.800
And I'm going to tell you why we're going to be doing.

48:22.800 --> 48:27.160
I had this crazy idea and I'm going to be

48:27.920 --> 48:30.280
I haven't decided if I'm going to be taking one or two people.

48:31.160 --> 48:35.880
But basically, long story short is we're going to be doing something

48:35.880 --> 48:40.640
that's kind of outside the box by with inside of digital landlords.

48:41.400 --> 48:44.280
It's going to be by application and qualification only.

48:44.280 --> 48:47.560
So if you apply for digital landlords,

48:47.560 --> 48:50.280
we'll probably run you through what I'm talking about here.

48:50.480 --> 48:52.520
That doesn't necessarily mean we'll choose you.

48:52.520 --> 48:55.800
But it's going to be very we're going to be doing something

48:55.800 --> 48:58.520
really interesting with one or two people.

48:59.640 --> 49:02.320
Basically, long story short, I'm not going to tell you all the details,

49:02.320 --> 49:06.040
but we're we're almost going to handhold you to getting your first deal.

49:07.840 --> 49:10.600
And it's it's going to be unique.

49:10.600 --> 49:13.360
You are going to have to do something in exchange.

49:13.360 --> 49:17.240
But for those of you that are like a little bit nervous or whatever, this

49:17.280 --> 49:20.040
like I'm basically going to make sure that you guys get a deal.

49:20.320 --> 49:22.640
So for those of you that are on the fence, I just want to

49:22.640 --> 49:24.160
I haven't talked about it much on this call at all.

49:24.160 --> 49:26.560
But Aaron just dropped a link.

49:26.720 --> 49:30.760
If you guys value your time and you're like, hey, these calls are great.

49:30.760 --> 49:32.760
I'm tired. Like some of you guys that are sitting here

49:32.760 --> 49:34.360
just waiting for free information.

49:34.360 --> 49:36.440
Now you've waited six weeks.

49:36.440 --> 49:38.200
You should have had to do if you were in the program,

49:38.200 --> 49:39.600
you could have had a deal by now. Right.

49:39.600 --> 49:42.800
But you're you're getting dribbled content and we're still talking about niches.

49:42.960 --> 49:45.160
Right. Because I can't cover everything in these calls.

49:45.320 --> 49:46.760
So anyway, here's the heads up.

49:46.760 --> 49:49.720
If that's something you've been on the fence about, I would apply right now

49:49.720 --> 49:51.520
because I have something really interesting.

49:51.520 --> 49:54.040
And it's we're going to be doing that either this week or next week.

49:54.280 --> 49:57.120
So mention this, what I just mentioned.

49:57.120 --> 50:01.760
And I will anyway, it's it's it's it's very interesting.

50:01.880 --> 50:03.720
Any if everyone is called would find it interesting.

50:03.720 --> 50:06.680
So just a heads up. OK, one more question.

50:06.680 --> 50:08.880
Yeah, let's see.

50:09.720 --> 50:11.480
Trey says this is the last question.

50:11.480 --> 50:15.640
Have you heard of anyone having luck in saltwater aquarium niche?

50:16.120 --> 50:18.720
No, but why not?

50:18.720 --> 50:22.800
You could do like fish tank installation, maybe like for artsy, fartsy, rich.

50:23.280 --> 50:26.920
For sure, bro. Like when I was in pool installation, guys,

50:27.120 --> 50:31.000
I had a website in Vegas, fiberglass drop in pools.

50:32.640 --> 50:37.320
So it's not landscaping, it's pools, it's not just pools, it's

50:37.800 --> 50:40.840
it's it's prefab pools, it's not just prefab pools,

50:40.840 --> 50:42.960
it's fiberglass prefab pools in Vegas.

50:43.360 --> 50:45.680
And the guys pay me two thousand bucks a month.

50:47.280 --> 50:48.840
Say less, Nick, say less.

50:48.840 --> 50:50.680
Guys, thanks for being on the call.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.840
Did you get a screenshot of everyone's on this call right now?

50:52.840 --> 50:55.240
Doing it right now. Thanks for the reminder.

50:55.280 --> 50:57.280
If you're on this call, you get the camera on,

50:57.280 --> 51:02.080
you're going to get a nice little nicely packaged digital resource

51:02.080 --> 51:04.440
that Aaron's going to put together today from my notes.

51:04.840 --> 51:06.800
And you're going to get that DM to you.

51:06.800 --> 51:10.880
And with that said, guys, again, if you're somebody, it's like, hey,

51:10.880 --> 51:14.000
I'm tired of like once you guys it clicks for you guys,

51:14.000 --> 51:15.240
that time is not coming back.

51:15.240 --> 51:16.640
You're not getting it back.

51:16.640 --> 51:20.680
Then you'll start to realize that who gives a rat's turd about money?

51:20.920 --> 51:23.160
You can always make the money back, dude.

51:23.160 --> 51:27.240
That money I spent to launch my program, dude, you know, it's funny about that.

51:28.760 --> 51:30.280
Well, people don't realize

51:30.280 --> 51:34.480
that guy that I that trained me on how to launch a program.

51:34.720 --> 51:36.840
I bought that in 2021. Ten thousand bucks.

51:36.840 --> 51:39.360
Never met the guy. I was in Dubai for a month.

51:39.720 --> 51:42.320
Dude moved to Dubai and I hit him up.

51:42.320 --> 51:44.680
I was like, hey, bro, I want you to know my first year,

51:44.680 --> 51:48.200
I made a million bucks following your training, which is true, by the way.

51:48.520 --> 51:51.600
And dude, he had me on his podcast, which is going to release here

51:51.600 --> 51:53.240
in the next couple of weeks.

51:53.240 --> 51:57.280
You don't you don't realize sometimes the club like this is a thing

51:57.280 --> 52:00.120
people don't talk about. You want to get close to somebody, go buy their stuff.

52:00.920 --> 52:04.240
I wasn't doing it for that intention, but this guy had me on his show.

52:04.480 --> 52:06.520
I've got his personal cell phone number.

52:06.520 --> 52:08.680
The guy takes over 10 million dollars a year.

52:09.080 --> 52:11.680
It's just, dude, so that's pay to play.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Just I'm just saying it's just a side thing.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.280
So anyway, that's it, guys.

52:15.280 --> 52:17.120
Thanks for being on the call.

52:17.120 --> 52:18.920
We'll see you guys next week.

52:18.920 --> 52:20.760
Thanks, Aaron. Take care, guys.
