WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.760
All right, we have two different type of ad accounts within Google, and those two are

00:16.760 --> 00:21.280
your just regular standard Google Ad account, Google Adwords account, and your what they

00:21.280 --> 00:25.120
call MCC, and I believe that stands for My Client Center.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.120
I could be wrong, and I don't care, okay, but I prefer to use the MCC.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.920
I'm going to talk about both really quick.

00:30.920 --> 00:34.720
The regular standard one, if you've never set up ads, you're going to be by default

00:34.720 --> 00:38.640
be pushed over to that one, and what that is is basically you can set up one account,

00:38.640 --> 00:43.560
and you can set up multiple campaigns underneath that one account.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.120
The reason I like the MCC account is, well, I plan on doing this for real.

00:47.120 --> 00:51.040
I plan on doing this big time, number one, but number two, it's just like an organizational

00:51.040 --> 00:55.320
thing, so what I like to personally do is I like for every single project, I like to

00:55.320 --> 00:58.200
have a new account and a new campaign.

00:58.280 --> 01:02.280
It's just really nice, let's just say I'm doing Minneapolis Concrete, then I'm going

01:02.280 --> 01:03.280
to create a new account.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.280
I'm going to show you guys all this.

01:04.280 --> 01:09.280
I'm going to create a Minneapolis Concrete account, and then I'm going to be able to

01:09.280 --> 01:15.960
create a campaign within that one that's Minneapolis Concrete, and it's the campaign.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.320
It's just a nice organizational tool so that I don't have to go in, it's one account, it's

01:19.320 --> 01:21.400
just this smorgasbord of stuff.

01:21.400 --> 01:25.760
However, I would prefer you to go fast, so if you're somebody that's never set up ads,

01:26.320 --> 01:31.080
I would prefer you to just, whatever pops up when you go to Google, just set one up,

01:31.080 --> 01:34.640
get them running, and we can go in later and switch the MCC account.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.480
I don't want you slowing down.

01:36.480 --> 01:37.480
That's the biggest thing.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.360
I don't want you slowing down for anything.

01:39.360 --> 01:43.360
Now, really, really quick, because I'm going to share my screen in just a moment.

01:43.360 --> 01:47.920
In version 1.0, I use a regular Google Ad account, so for this training, I'm going to

01:47.920 --> 01:49.400
use an MCC account.

01:49.400 --> 01:53.200
If you're somebody that's new and like, oh my gosh, what does it look like if it's regular?

01:53.200 --> 01:54.200
Just go and look at version 1.0.

01:54.640 --> 01:55.640
I'm going to leave that in the Facebook group.

01:55.640 --> 02:02.000
Go to the module 3, the digital steroids, and you'll see an example of setting it up

02:02.000 --> 02:05.200
with just a regular Google Ad account that comes as default.

02:05.200 --> 02:09.040
I want to show you an MCC account to be fair to those that have MCC accounts.

02:09.040 --> 02:13.480
Lastly, if you have a regular account or you set up a regular account, you just need to

02:13.480 --> 02:14.640
get in touch with Google.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.920
I know they're a pain in the butt to reach, but to my knowledge, that's the easiest way

02:17.920 --> 02:19.560
is you're going to find a number.

02:19.560 --> 02:23.360
I'm going to see if I can find a number, put it in the description of a quick way to reach

02:23.600 --> 02:24.600
It's always changing.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.120
Plus, we're blaming it on COVID, and I honestly don't know.

02:28.120 --> 02:29.720
It's always adjusting.

02:29.720 --> 02:33.640
Get a hold of them and tell them you want to switch to an MCC account, and they'll do

02:33.640 --> 02:34.640
it for you.

02:34.640 --> 02:35.640
Okay?

02:35.640 --> 02:36.640
I'm going to share my screen now.

02:36.640 --> 02:37.640
All right.

02:37.640 --> 02:41.080
Guys, quickest, easiest way, go to Google, and you're going to be blown away.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.200
Type in Google AdWords.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.200
Google AdWords.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.200
Really, really simple.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.200
Okay?

02:47.200 --> 02:48.200
First thing that comes up is going to be the ad.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.560
You can either click on that one if you want to charge Google.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.560
They probably don't charge themselves.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.560
I'm going to click on it.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.560
If they charge themselves, they're idiots.

02:52.760 --> 02:53.760
Okay?

02:53.760 --> 02:55.840
Now, what you're going to do is you're going to sign in.

02:55.840 --> 02:59.840
Now, you can do this however you want.

02:59.840 --> 03:05.680
I would use some kind of company email or something that is going to be more broad rather

03:05.680 --> 03:11.320
than just setting this up under your bentonvilleconcrete at gmail.com.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.640
That's just my recommendation, but don't overthink this.

03:13.640 --> 03:14.640
It doesn't matter.

03:14.640 --> 03:18.200
I do want you to notice, though, it is going to ask you to sign in, and in some cases it

03:18.200 --> 03:22.480
may just sign you in automatically based on the email you already logged into.

03:23.400 --> 03:27.600
Guys, if you're not using Chrome for whatever number of time, go switch to Chrome.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.600
Just trust me.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.600
Okay?

03:29.600 --> 03:30.600
All right, so I'm going to sign in.

03:30.600 --> 03:35.160
All right, so guys, what you're seeing here is my Google Ad account.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.440
This is my MCC account.

03:36.440 --> 03:39.580
It's going to look a little bit different than some of yours are going to look.

03:39.580 --> 03:42.680
If you guys do not have an MCC account, it's okay.

03:42.680 --> 03:47.480
One thing I want to point out, if I haven't shown you already, I have run $1.2 million

03:47.480 --> 03:48.480
of my own money.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.480
I don't have any partners.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.480
I don't have any of that.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.040
This is my own hard-earned money.

03:52.600 --> 03:57.320
I know what to not do and teach you what not to do because I have spent this.

03:57.320 --> 04:01.080
Notice how I didn't say, I'll teach you what to do, because I feel like sometimes I learn

04:01.080 --> 04:05.580
by learning what not to do, but I have spent a good chunk of change learning what I'm about

04:05.580 --> 04:06.580
to show you.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.580
Okay?

04:07.580 --> 04:10.520
First thing I'm going to teach you to do is just to set up a new account.

04:10.520 --> 04:11.520
Okay?

04:11.520 --> 04:12.520
Very, very simple.

04:12.520 --> 04:17.080
Again, we're talking about inside of an MCC account, so if you have your own, you have

04:17.080 --> 04:21.360
a different regular Google, if yours looks different than this, it's okay.

04:21.960 --> 04:23.640
We just need to get an account set up.

04:23.640 --> 04:24.640
Okay?

04:24.640 --> 04:25.640
Really, really simple.

04:25.640 --> 04:30.120
If you do have an MCC account, just click on, you guessed it, accounts, and then you

04:30.120 --> 04:31.600
see this plus sign.

04:31.600 --> 04:32.600
What would you think you would get?

04:32.600 --> 04:35.480
If I were to hold a gun to your head, you'd probably be like, yeah, I probably want to

04:35.480 --> 04:36.480
hit the plus.

04:36.480 --> 04:37.480
Push the plus button.

04:37.480 --> 04:38.480
Okay?

04:38.480 --> 04:43.000
Then it's going to say, create new manager account, nope, create new account.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.600
I don't want a new manager account.

04:44.600 --> 04:45.600
That's the MCC account.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.600
I just want a new account.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.600
Okay?

04:47.840 --> 04:53.400
Set one up for the project that we are currently doing with this example.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.400
Okay?

04:54.400 --> 04:59.040
So, next thing that you're going to do is you're just going to put in a little bit of

04:59.040 --> 05:00.040
information.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.040
Okay?

05:01.040 --> 05:05.640
So, on the account name, I just like to keep it really clean, and I like to put Queen Creek

05:05.640 --> 05:06.640
Concrete.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.640
Go figure.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.640
Okay?

05:08.640 --> 05:09.640
All right.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.640
Type.

05:10.640 --> 05:14.640
Now, this is where you need to pay attention.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.640
Okay?

05:15.680 --> 05:21.440
I'm going to have you do the smart campaign type, okay?

05:21.440 --> 05:22.440
Trust me on this.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.840
I know there's some of you guys that have been in the game forever, and you're like,

05:24.840 --> 05:26.840
oh, I'm not going to do that because blah, blah, blah.

05:26.840 --> 05:31.120
If you guys already know Google Ads like the back of your hand, then be my guest, but

05:31.120 --> 05:35.040
if you've never run Google Ads, trust me, I understand if you look online, it's going

05:35.040 --> 05:37.120
to charge you a little bit more money, but guess what it does?

05:37.120 --> 05:39.320
It allows you to go fast, and money loves speed.

05:39.320 --> 05:40.320
Okay?

05:40.320 --> 05:42.120
So, you're not going to choose Google Ad account.

05:42.120 --> 05:45.040
You're going to choose smart campaign account.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.440
Boom.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.440
Okay?

05:47.440 --> 05:48.440
Select your country.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.440
I don't care what country you're in.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.440
Select your country.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.440
I'm in the U.S., obviously.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.440
Select your time zone.

05:52.440 --> 05:53.440
Okay?

05:53.440 --> 05:59.560
Honestly, I don't know if the way to do it is to select the time zone of the project,

05:59.560 --> 06:00.560
whatever.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.960
Typically, with this, what I understand is if you're going to do it by certain times,

06:04.960 --> 06:06.440
and we're not going to mess that, so it doesn't matter.

06:06.440 --> 06:09.200
I will probably do it as Phoenix time just for the heck of it.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.200
Okay?

06:10.200 --> 06:14.640
Select your currency, and then we're not going to invite any users, so just save and continue.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.240
Okay?

06:16.240 --> 06:20.600
Now, it says you're about blah, blah, blah, okay.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.080
You're making important changes to your account.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.080
Keep your data safe.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.080
Please confirm it's really okay.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.080
It's going to confirm.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.080
Okay.

06:26.080 --> 06:33.200
So, now my account is set up, and I have so many, I like to just filter this and go name,

06:33.200 --> 06:42.920
and I'm going to do Queen Creek, and here we are, ready, set, go.

06:43.200 --> 06:50.480
So, guys, we've now successfully set up an account within our MCC My Client Center account.

06:50.480 --> 06:55.080
If you are just using regular, like it's your first time logging in on that email, it's

06:55.080 --> 06:56.640
probably already going to have an account set up.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.560
If not, just push new account.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.040
It's very, very easy to do.

07:01.040 --> 07:07.400
Again, if you do not have an MCC, it's okay, and on version 1.0, I use a regular account,

07:07.400 --> 07:08.560
so don't overthink it.

07:08.560 --> 07:09.560
Don't stress it.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.800
We are going to go and set up a campaign.
