00:00.000 --> 00:07.940
so now that we have inserted the page title we're going to do the page

00:07.940 --> 00:12.540
description right here so just so you know the page description let's say you

00:12.540 --> 00:19.380
were looking for Bentonville concrete is this description right here that comes

00:19.380 --> 00:25.620
up and I'm sure so see how Angie's list right here it says dot dot dot that's

00:25.620 --> 00:28.780
something that we don't want we want everything in the page description to be

00:28.780 --> 00:33.500
able to fit and how you do that is just to keep it's just by keeping the page

00:33.500 --> 00:38.620
description between 160 and 165 characters and again we're going to use

00:38.620 --> 00:43.580
the word counter page descriptions are very easy to do you're just pretty much

00:43.580 --> 00:49.220
giving a short brief simple description of what that page is about so for the

00:49.220 --> 00:55.860
home page right here I would probably just and I'm just going to type it in

00:55.860 --> 01:01.740
here so I know exactly when I'm hitting that 160 character mark I would say

01:01.740 --> 01:21.780
