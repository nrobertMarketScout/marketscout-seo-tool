Hey guys, so you guys are asking questions about how to know where to set up your daily

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,060
budget.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,740
So I'm going to go through one of the ads that we have set up here.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,820
This is for a patio cover and we're going to just kind of show you how we set that up.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,340
So the big thing that we use to set that up as we go through the training is what your

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:27,500
CPC is and bidding your CPC using tools like the Keyword Planner here is where we go and

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,340
we learn how much the keywords are going to be and that will typically set us up for what

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,780
our daily budget will be.

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:41,220
When you go and you set up your ad and you set up your daily budget, you will have like

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:49,300
right here we set up our daily budget of $45 a day and that was based on what our CPC was

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,660
going to be and what we wanted to do for that area.

12
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:04,180
So you can see here that this gives me a bunch of different options which anywhere from $23.26

13
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:10,020
all the way up to $292 a day and it will give you how many clicks to expect and the cost,

14
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,380
the impressions and how much to get to the top impression.

15
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,640
So that is one way to look at it.

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,260
We try to keep it between typically between $25 to $35 a day.

17
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,860
This area is San Antonio, Texas so it's a little bit more but you can see here that

18
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,620
we've been getting good results at $45 a day for our client and you can see here that Google

19
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,180
is wanting to push us all the way up to $300 a day.

20
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,700
So that's just where you need to apply that.
