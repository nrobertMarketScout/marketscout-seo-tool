00:00.000 --> 00:15.360
Live transferring the samples. There is a correct way to do this and I'm going to teach

00:15.360 --> 00:18.640
it to you right now. The first thing I want to mention is this, if you are somebody that

00:18.640 --> 00:23.360
has a job, if you are somebody that doesn't have the ability or doesn't want to have to

00:23.360 --> 00:29.120
be glued to their phone all day every day, welcome to the club. I'm somebody where if

00:30.080 --> 00:33.760
I get a call in the middle of the day and I picked up every single call, I would never

00:33.760 --> 00:37.120
get anything done. My mind would be here and it would be here and it would be here. I have

00:37.120 --> 00:40.240
to put my phone on silent. For some of you guys that are trying to get a hold of me sometimes,

00:40.240 --> 00:46.240
that's why. I have to put my phone on silent for this to work, for me to be able to do anything,

00:46.240 --> 00:49.760
to be productive at all. I totally understand that and I don't want you guys to worry.

00:50.720 --> 00:54.160
If you are somebody that can't answer in the day because of a job or anything else,

00:54.960 --> 01:01.280
it's okay. Here's what I do is I wait, I let all my calls go to voicemail or missed call or whatever

01:01.280 --> 01:09.040
and then I put a slot of time in my calendar every day and I on my time go and look at my missed

01:09.040 --> 01:13.760
calls and I call them back. These are the leads. I call them back and do the live transfers on my

01:13.760 --> 01:17.680
time. If you're somebody that's like, oh, this isn't going to work for me because I have a job,

01:17.680 --> 01:21.680
it's fine. You can do it after work. You can do it on your lunch break. You can do it on

01:21.680 --> 01:25.600
Saturdays and if you're like, oh my gosh, I don't get off work until five, doesn't matter.

01:25.600 --> 01:30.320
People actually answer the phone more after work. Don't stress it. It's not the end of the world.

01:31.360 --> 01:35.600
I'm just going to teach you guys really quick the best way to do the live transfer.

01:37.280 --> 01:40.800
First thing I want to mention is a lot of people get confused with this. They're like, well,

01:40.800 --> 01:45.040
do you call the lead and then you hook the business owner with the lead live? Here's the

01:45.040 --> 01:49.200
process that I do. Just a quick overview. If I haven't hooked a business owner, let's say I'm

01:49.200 --> 01:55.840
in my first pre-sale, my first campaign, my first deal or a deal. I haven't hooked a business owner.

01:55.840 --> 02:00.880
I've set up the campaign. I've done my niche research. I'm good to go. I've done my city

02:00.880 --> 02:07.760
research. I'm good to go. I've built my list. I've set up my ad and a lead comes in. What I

02:07.760 --> 02:12.640
will typically do is I will get ahold of the lead. Let's say the lead's name is Janet. I don't know

02:12.640 --> 02:17.120
why I really like using the name Janet for this example, but I'm going to use Janet. Janet calls.

02:17.120 --> 02:21.600
I call her back. By the way, if you do call back, I want you to say the following. Hey, Janet,

02:21.600 --> 02:25.520
this is Nick with St. George Tree Service. You might not know it's Janet. The only reason you

02:25.520 --> 02:29.600
would know it was Janet is if she filled out a form. Let's just say, hey, this is Nick with

02:29.600 --> 02:33.520
St. George Tree Service. By the way, I'm actually calling you from my cell phone. It's been a crazy

02:33.520 --> 02:38.160
day, so I apologize for the weird area code. I'm guessing you need an estimate. If you notice how

02:38.160 --> 02:43.280
I did that, I brought up the objection first because I know she's already thinking, what the

02:43.280 --> 02:48.640
heck is your weird area code? I have the weirdest area code ever. I bring that up first and I assume

02:48.640 --> 02:53.760
I'm like, hey, I'm guessing you need an estimate. I don't say, hey, do you need an estimate? Yes,

02:53.760 --> 03:00.320
no question usually leads to a no. Even if they need one, they'll just go, oh, wait, what? Hey,

03:00.320 --> 03:04.960
I'm guessing you need an estimate. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do. If you do call back, I want you to

03:04.960 --> 03:09.280
say something to that extent of, hey, this is Nick with such and such company. You're going to act,

03:09.280 --> 03:12.960
by the way, as the operator and you're going to let them know you're calling from your cell phone

03:12.960 --> 03:16.480
because it's been a crazy day or you're on the road or you're out and about or whatever, or that's

03:16.480 --> 03:21.440
just the number you grew up with because you want them to know that we are local. We want them to

03:21.440 --> 03:26.960
know that the website is local. The first step is you're going to call the lead or answer the lead

03:26.960 --> 03:32.400
and you are going to act as the operator, meaning you're going to act like you're just sitting there

03:32.400 --> 03:36.000
answering the phone for the company. You work for the business owner or whatever. I typically,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.760
if I'm answering it live, I'll say the same thing. Hey, this is Nick with St. George Tree Service.

03:39.840 --> 03:44.240
I'm guessing you need an estimate. Okay, cool. Let me grab your information. Okay, cool. What's

03:44.240 --> 03:50.240
your address? Awesome. What's the best number to reach yet? Awesome. Okay, cool. Zip code.

03:50.240 --> 03:54.800
I'll get all the information and I'll say this. All right, Janet. What I'm going to do is the

03:54.800 --> 03:58.800
business owner, I'm going to get a hold of him and we're going to get you scheduled. He is on

03:58.800 --> 04:04.400
a job right now. He's typically out running about doing estimates. Let me get a hold of him and

04:04.400 --> 04:09.520
we'll be reaching back out ASAP. If you don't hear from us for a minute, it's because he's on

04:09.520 --> 04:15.760
a job. Like I said, and by the way, I might be calling from an 854 area code. That's just my

04:15.760 --> 04:20.320
cell phone, so don't worry about it. That's just me. We will be in touch very shortly. Awesome,

04:20.320 --> 04:25.440
Janet. Thank you. Now, Janet, the lead is teed up because keep in mind, I haven't called the

04:25.440 --> 04:29.600
business owner. Now, this is going to change. Once we call the business owner, this live transfer

04:29.600 --> 04:33.040
process becomes more simple because we can immediately just transfer it over. For this

04:33.040 --> 04:39.360
first one, I just have Janet teed up. Okay, so Janet's teed up and now we go and hook the

04:39.360 --> 04:45.040
business owner. Okay, so go back to the last step and you're going to hook the business owner. So,

04:45.040 --> 04:48.480
you're going to use the script and you got Janet and that's the lead that you're going to use.

04:48.480 --> 04:52.160
Okay, so now we got a hold of the business owner and if you remember from last module,

04:52.160 --> 04:57.040
if you didn't watch it, go watch it. We tell the business owner, hey, save this number right here

04:57.040 --> 05:01.120
or save XYZ number, whatever number is going to be doing the live transfer. We are going to be

05:01.120 --> 05:05.600
calling you and there's going to be a live person on the phone that wants an estimate. Okay,

05:05.600 --> 05:09.280
you're going to hook the business owner and then what I will do is I'll hang up with the business

05:09.280 --> 05:14.720
owner and then I will call Janet back. Okay, so I'll call Janet. Hey, Janet, it's Nick again with

05:14.720 --> 05:19.440
St. George Tree Service again. Sorry for the weird area code. I know, I know. Cool. Hey, I actually

05:19.440 --> 05:25.920
have Jim. I just barely spoke with him. He is kind of out and about right now but he wants to just

05:25.920 --> 05:29.680
get you scheduled. So, hang on one second. I'm going to patch you in with him so we can get you

05:29.680 --> 05:35.280
on the calendar and come give you a free estimate. Okay, so give me one second. Boom. I put her on

05:35.280 --> 05:40.400
or I just wait and I push add call. Now, some of you guys are like, I'm overseas and I don't have

05:40.400 --> 05:45.760
an iPhone or this doesn't work. There's a ton of tools. Guys, search the group, ask the questions.

05:45.760 --> 05:49.920
There are tools. Everyone has found a workaround for this. I do know CallRel has an option where

05:50.720 --> 05:53.760
you can get a phone number so you don't have to use your own cell phone and you can do a merge

05:53.760 --> 05:58.880
feature. There's a lot of ways around this. Do not disrupt your hands and say, oh, it doesn't work

05:58.880 --> 06:03.200
for me because I'm not in the U.S. and I don't have an iPhone or whatever. There is always a

06:03.200 --> 06:09.120
solution so don't be that guy, don't be that lady. That's the first thing. Anyway, just a quick

06:09.120 --> 06:15.600
caveat. Janet's right there and I push add call and I then push add call and I go find Jim and I

06:15.600 --> 06:19.760
call Jim. Now, the way this works with the live transfer is she's going to be on mute and I'm

06:19.760 --> 06:23.600
going to be speaking with Jim. Jim answers, hey Jim. I'm going to use my other hand so we know

06:23.600 --> 06:28.400
we're talking to Jim. Hey Jim, Nick here again. Hey, I actually, like I told you, I had that lead,

06:28.400 --> 06:33.440
that job, her name is Janet on the phone right now. So I just, to make it simple, I just told

06:33.440 --> 06:37.040
her I work for you. I'm going to put you guys on a three-way call really quick and I'm just going

06:37.040 --> 06:42.560
to have you schedule her. Just so you know, she has an oak tree, she needs it removed,

06:42.560 --> 06:47.680
she's gotten a couple estimates, blah, blah, blah, and she's at 84790 just so you know. But again,

06:47.680 --> 06:53.040
I just acted like I work for you so give me one second. Okay, cool. Okay, Jim's good. Jim's good,

06:53.040 --> 06:59.360
Janet's good. Then I push this button that says merge. So I merge the call. Boom. Now everybody's

06:59.360 --> 07:05.280
on the call. So what I say now is I go, hey Janet, can you hear me? Awesome. Hey Jim, can you hear me?

07:05.280 --> 07:11.040
Cool. Hey guys, so Jim, this is Janet. She's the one I was telling you about. She needs her tree

07:11.040 --> 07:15.200
removed. She's over at this street address. And Janet, this is Jim. He's my boss. He's the owner.

07:15.200 --> 07:18.320
He's the one that's going to be coming and taking a look and giving you a free estimate. Anyway,

07:18.320 --> 07:24.080
awesome guys. I'm going to take myself off the call. Appreciate it. And thanks again. Put yourself

07:24.080 --> 07:30.880
on mute, okay? And your work is done. And now what you're going to do is you are going to listen,

07:30.880 --> 07:33.760
okay? You're going to listen and you're going to listen to the business owner. You're going to make

07:33.760 --> 07:36.720
sure he doesn't screw it up. You're going to listen to the business owner. Make sure he doesn't try to

07:36.720 --> 07:40.160
undercut you. You're going to listen to the business owner. Make sure he schedules an estimate.

07:40.160 --> 07:44.640
Make sure he does it correctly and he's not passive in all this different stuff and he's

07:44.640 --> 07:48.800
not dropping price. This is going to give you an opportunity to see if this is a business owner you

07:48.800 --> 07:52.640
want to work with, okay? So you're going to put yourself on mute and you're going to listen,

07:52.640 --> 07:59.680
okay? You're going to listen to these calls. And I never ever jump back in on the call unless

07:59.680 --> 08:03.520
I have to. So if the business owner, or sorry, if the customer starts going,

08:04.320 --> 08:09.520
yeah, and maybe she thinks I'm off the call or whatever, she goes, yeah, so I thought I called

08:10.160 --> 08:15.120
St. George Tree Service or I thought I called Southern Utah Tree Service, like, who are you?

08:15.760 --> 08:20.080
Then I'll jump back in and go, hey, sorry, Janet, I'm still here. I just wanted to explain this.

08:20.080 --> 08:24.080
The name of the company is Jim's Tree Service. That's just one of our websites. So just to clear

08:24.080 --> 08:28.400
up that confusion. Anyway, go ahead, guys. I'll jump back in if necessary, but it's very, very,

08:28.400 --> 08:32.800
very rare. It's only to save the deal if I can just see it's going sideways. Or if the business

08:32.800 --> 08:37.520
owner starts going, yeah, this guy just called me out of nowhere, then I'll cut him off and be like,

08:37.520 --> 08:44.560
hey, bro, I'm still on the line. I'm going to control that process, that handoff, because,

08:44.560 --> 08:49.280
guys, this is digital gold. I'm not just going to let them screw up a lead, but I'm also not

08:49.280 --> 08:53.520
going to jump in and be all weird. But the biggest thing is you guys want to listen to how these

08:53.520 --> 08:58.400
business owners are handling the customer. All right, guys, the last thing that I want to mention

08:58.400 --> 09:04.320
is what happens if you call Janet and you tell the business owner, answer your freaking phone,

09:04.400 --> 09:08.960
save my number, blah, blah, blah. Then you call Janet, you get ahold of Janet, you go to transfer

09:08.960 --> 09:13.200
the call and freaking business owner still doesn't answer. And it is very frustrating. I totally

09:13.200 --> 09:16.960
understand that because now you're like, oh my gosh, Janet's going to think I look like I'm an

09:16.960 --> 09:21.760
idiot. Here's what you're going to do. You're not going to panic. You're not going to be weird.

09:21.760 --> 09:25.440
You're simply going to tell Janet, you're going to say, hey, Janet, he must have got tied up on

09:25.440 --> 09:30.080
another job or on a call. So here's what we'll do. This is going to be the easiest thing just to make

09:30.080 --> 09:34.560
sure it's okay with you. I'm going to just put you, in fact, don't ask. Don't ask. I don't know

09:34.560 --> 09:39.120
why you even said that. Don't freaking ask if it's okay with you. Just do. Hey, Janet, here's what

09:39.120 --> 09:43.520
we're going to do. He's on another job, whatever. I'm actually going to put you in a three-way group

09:43.520 --> 09:49.360
text with me, you, and him. And he's going to message you and find a time to call you and get

09:49.360 --> 09:55.200
you scheduled for an estimate. Okay? So watch for that here in just a moment and we will be out very

09:55.200 --> 09:58.560
soon. And then what you're going to do is you're going to do the same thing. You're going to have

09:58.560 --> 10:03.840
them both on the group text. Hey, Janet, this is Jim. Jim, this is Janet, blah, blah, blah, just like

10:03.840 --> 10:08.000
you would on a live transfer. But what this three-way text allows you to do is it allows you to

10:08.000 --> 10:13.280
monitor the whole situation, allows you to watch and see if the business owner even gets a hold

10:13.280 --> 10:20.000
of the lead, if he even is taking action, if he's even incentivized to go after it. Because

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
sometimes you'll send these leads and you think, oh, these guys are calling these leads. They're

10:24.000 --> 10:28.720
not. Okay? So you doing the three-way text, it lets the business owner know, hey, I'm watching

10:28.720 --> 10:34.080
this thing and you better be texting her back because I just gave you a job. Okay? So that is

10:34.080 --> 10:40.000
the next best option if the business owner does not answer. Now, I don't want you thinking, oh,

10:40.000 --> 10:44.880
I'll just do group text. I'll just do three-way text. I promise you, look me in the freaking eyes.

10:44.880 --> 10:50.880
I promise you doing a live transfer is far better. But the second best option, if they don't answer

10:50.880 --> 10:56.400
because it's going to happen, okay, you're going to do the three-way text. All right, guys. So that

10:56.400 --> 11:04.960
is it for how to actually send and actually perform the live transfers. Do it exactly as I say.

11:04.960 --> 11:09.040
You can use the same lines that I've used. You can use the verbiage that I've used. Act as the

11:09.040 --> 11:15.840
operator. Do it exactly as I've done. I've tried. Trust me. And for the third time, I have tried

11:15.840 --> 11:20.480
every way under the sun. This is the most effective, quickest way to get them leads and close

11:20.480 --> 11:27.520
the deal.
