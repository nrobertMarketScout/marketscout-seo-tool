00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,780
Let's talk about the Google trifecta, the three parts of Google and it's very important

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,360
that you guys understand this and guys the more that you can understand about Google

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,700
and how it works and how they think and how they operate, the easier it is for us to do

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,860
SEO because we just need to reverse engineer what they're thinking.

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,420
So really quick, the Google trifecta, that is the three different sections of Google.

6
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,260
First we have the ads, which is the very top section of Google.

7
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,860
So if you do a search, boom, you're going to see that at the top, it's going to say

8
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,860
ad next to it.

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,800
That's the ad section.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,140
The next section that we're going to have is what we call Google Local.

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,460
It's also called the Google My Business or GMB or Google Business Profiles, whatever.

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,460
They keep changing the name.

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,260
It's also called the Map Pack, the Three Pack, whatever.

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,940
It's probably going to be called the Dinosaur Pack by the time this video.

15
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,940
I don't even know.

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,940
Whatever Google decides.

17
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,460
Larry Page and Sergey Brin, shout out to you guys for having some creative minds.

18
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,460
I don't know.

19
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,540
That's the local section.

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,940
And there is a specific strategy to ranking in that section that we are going to be covering

21
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,700
in a later module.

22
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,540
And then underneath the map, we have the third section, which is what we would call to or

23
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,180
I'm going to refer to as the actual organic listings, which is underneath the maps.

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,900
That's where your website ranks at the top of the organic.

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,660
So there's, depending on the search, there's usually one to three ads.

26
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,120
Then there's three in the map.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,580
Sometimes there's four because there's an ad in the maps, if you look really careful.

28
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,100
One of those is an ad.

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,300
Then there's 10 search results.

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,380
And then sometimes you'll see some ads at the bottom.

31
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:52,860
And that is what makes up the Google Trifecta, ads, local, and organic.

32
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,860
Very important.

33
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,860
You understand that.

34
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:54,880
Let's keep going.
