Irving, we have a site that ranks very well organically, about 80 gross leads a month,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,720
but about 75% of leads are spam calls, web forums, still 20 qualified leads. A business

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,560
owner is not digging it, misses some calls, and when he does pick up, it's spam calls.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,360
Any suggestions for a situation like this? I told him to pick up every call, follow up every call,

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,400
because the call he misses out might be a juicy one that he'll miss out on.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,720
I don't know what you're using. I know with some of these tools, you can blacklist some of these,

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,800
but I'm going to be honest, I've had this happen a lot, and I think not a lot, but it had to happen

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,960
a few times. I think when you're buying tracking numbers, you just got to realize that sometimes

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,560
you get a shitty one, and sometimes it's a number that's been spammed out, and so there have been a

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,600
couple instances where we've just had to change the phone number, and it sucks because you have

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,560
to go and update it on your GMB and the whole thing, but what I would do first is try and do

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,000
the blacklisting thing and see if you can figure that out, and then if you absolutely have to,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,320
I think it's worth it long term to just let the business owner say, hey, we're going to have a

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,000
little bit of a decrease in calls, but we're getting a new phone number to get rid of this issue,

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,000
and now every call that comes in should be a good one. Now you've got to go update your citations

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,760
and all that good stuff, but nonetheless, I think that it's worth it at some point.
