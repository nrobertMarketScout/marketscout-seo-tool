00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Nick would how often would you say you set up an ad in a niche and it never starts generating leads ratio between number of

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,200
ads set up to ones that become sellable

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,360
It does happen. Um

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,200
It's not happened a ton for me. So if you guys follow the due diligence process follow the metrics

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,600
You

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,000
Most likely will generate leads now. I will say that I have in the past been a little aggressive gotten a little cocky

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,000
Decided to test things out and i've gotten to where you know, i'm i'm doing stuff

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
It's a little too high on the cpc. I'm like, oh well if it's five bucks that seven is fine

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,080
Or ten is fine. I've also gone into markets that are really small just to test out

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,840
So it will happen, but it shouldn't be happening very often. I would say

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,560
like maybe uh less than

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,520
You know probably less than 15 percent of the time if you're having that happen on 50 percent of your campaigns

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,260
Then you're you're missing a step on selecting the niche
