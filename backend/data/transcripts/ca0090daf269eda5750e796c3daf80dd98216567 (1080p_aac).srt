1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Amazing.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,320
All right, guys, welcome to the freaking call.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,000
I've been waiting for this call for a long time.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,440
I know you guys have as well.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,440
First and foremost, I want to let you guys know that and keep, let me know where you

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,120
guys are coming from, where you guys are tuning in from.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,320
I'm going to read them here in a second.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,800
And again, as I said, for those of you that just hopped on, as I'm trying to figure out

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,920
giveaways, I'm going to try and keep up on the giveaways, Aaron Vogler, I hope you're

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,280
ready to take some notes because we're going to be giving away a bunch of stuff today.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,960
But I want to see your names and why you guys did not just spam the comments, but give

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,960
some value.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
Okay.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,560
Add some value, add some insight.

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,560
That's what I want to see.

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,120
That's who's going to be getting the giveaway stuff.

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,120
Okay.

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,340
So a couple of things really, really quick.

19
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,160
Let me make sure I get my notes dialed in because I got a lot going on on my screen

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,880
here.

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
Let's see.

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,200
Okay.

23
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,480
Let me just tell you guys really, really quick once again.

24
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,200
So stay on till the end.

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,000
This is going to be less than an hour.

26
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,720
So we're going to try to keep it.

27
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,560
We are going to be giving away five coaching calls with Donnie Dre.

28
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,560
We're going to be giving away five coaching calls with the daddy of digital real estate,

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,360
Porter, who is just trailing behind Jason, but it's also getting his trash kicked because

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,040
Jason's beating him by like 4,000.

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,400
Come on Porter, pick it up.

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,520
You can't call yourself the daddy if you're getting beat.

33
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Okay.

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,880
So five calls with Donnie, five calls with daddy.

35
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,920
We're going to get five swag winners.

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,320
We're going to be giving away these t-shirts, the OG digital landlord t-shirts, maybe given

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,400
some, I might even give away more than that.

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,480
We're going to be doing three winners of the exclusive training library, which is like,

39
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:44,560
I think it's 14 hours or more of trainings that we did that we did not put in this group.

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
We're just going to give you the library.

41
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,680
We're going to give three of those.

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,680
We're going to give away two partial scholarships, and we're also going to be giving away a pair

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,440
of the Apple AirPod Max.

44
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:59,080
So we've got a ton of stuff to go through, and we are going to be covering a lot, okay?

45
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,760
One thing I want to cover really quick before I bring Ryan Dalton on is if you did not already,

46
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,200
I want you guys to go check out my latest post, okay?

47
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,200
And in that post I mentioned, I said something to the extent of the Facebook group as you

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,720
know it has an expiration date, okay?

49
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,200
Why and what does that mean?

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,920
I'm not going to be, this isn't going to be a dramatic thing.

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,640
It's just going to happen.

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,340
I've been saying this for a long time.

53
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,740
People do not value what they do not pay for.

54
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,740
Facts, okay?

55
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,740
Period.

56
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,740
End of story.

57
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,260
You do not value what you do not pay for.

58
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,980
I don't care if it's a freaking soft drink or if it's a course or if it's whatever the

59
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,980
case is.

60
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,180
If it's a vehicle that your parents gave you, when you pay for it, you value it, okay?

61
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,180
That's just how it works, okay?

62
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,380
You get a free training session at the gym.

63
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,400
It's way different than if you pay 150 bucks to be there with a trainer.

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,960
You value it differently, and that's just how it's going to work.

65
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,980
So I made a post, go read it, and for those of you that are sitting there and you actually

66
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,700
are serious about this, we have the link in there.

67
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,580
You guys know what you got to do, and I think I even put in the hashtag, you pay the piper

68
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,660
or you pay somebody that's paid the piper, but I just want to make sure this is clear

69
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,620
since we have 70 people on this call right now, that if you wake up one day and the group

70
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,120
is no longer there or it's completely different and you no longer have access, that is why,

71
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
okay?

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,000
People don't value what they don't pay for.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,220
So if you are somebody that's been sitting on the fence, oh my gosh, I'm not sure if

74
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,860
I should do it, I'm going to have to take a risk, then maybe now is the time, okay?

75
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,380
That's just all I'm going to say about it.

76
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,020
The link is there, and also, you know what I'll do to make it very simple, let me see

77
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,500
if I can actually do this really quick, and then we're going to get into it.

78
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,180
I am going to mute one thing.

79
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,820
One last thing here, let me copy this for anybody that needs it.

80
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,840
There is the link, the digital landlords link, because that's what I posted in the thing,

81
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,520
and no one can tell me that they didn't see it.

82
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,680
I think that's working, okay.

83
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Hopefully that's working.

84
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,780
Yeah, it didn't work.

85
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,780
That's amazing.

86
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,780
Hold on.

87
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,780
That's funny.

88
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,780
Just kidding.

89
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,340
Don't follow that link.

90
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,340
Don't follow that link.

91
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,340
Okay.

92
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,500
That said, guys, let me find this really quick, and then we're going to be bringing on Mr.

93
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,000
Ryan Dalton, and it is going to be a freaking live.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, where the heck is this at?

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
All right, where the hell is it at?

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
There it is.

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
One, two, three, copy, go back here, delete this.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Sorry about that, guys, and yeah, I saw the 404 message.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
My bad.

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I think that one's going to work.

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Still didn't work.

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay, Aaron, what I need you to do, that's hilarious.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Aaron, I need you to go and find the link.

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah, it's not working.

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's amazing.

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I love that.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Well, just kidding.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's too late, guys.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's too late.

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay, here's what we'll do.

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Watch this.

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Watch this.

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
All right, where the hell is it at?

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There it is.

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay, done.

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Now I can do it.

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If that doesn't work, you know what I think the problem is?

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I think it's just too late.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I think that's all it is.

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
All right, let's see, paste, and yeah, there we go.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
All right, should be good now.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Look at this.

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We've got 86 people on, guys.

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There, Aaron.

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Thanks for jumping in there.

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I think that should work, too.

127
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
All right, between me and Aaron, one of those suckers is going to work.

128
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If not, then it's just too late.

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay, there we go.

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I think that should work.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Aha.

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Boom.

133
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay, good to go.

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
All right, that's all I'm going to say on that, guys.

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If possible, pin comment.

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There we go.

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
All right, let's get in the call.

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Again, we're going to be, let's give away.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Well, I'm going to bring Ryan Dalton on before we give it away.

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let me give a little bit of a preface, and let's get into today's call.

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Guys, stoked about today's call because, let me give a little bit of a

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
backstory.

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Back in 2020, when I was, well, back starting in 2016, as I got into this

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
business, and I was like, hey, I got to scale this thing, I got to scale

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
this thing, I got to scale this thing.

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
As I attempted to scale this business, and I finally was able to scale in

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
2020, we reached $125,000 in 2021.

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That was the max that we reached.

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
By the way, I think Ryan Dalton's going to come kick my butt here shortly,

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
which I love.

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's actually the biggest compliment ever.

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But anyway, as I did that, guys, I built this business.

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I basically felt like I willed it into existence.

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I was doing the calls.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I was doing all the sales.

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I did have some people, but it wasn't systematized.

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It wasn't clean.

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It wasn't built properly, okay?

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I felt like I had this duct-taped business that was just hanging on by a

160
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
thread.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And yes, I pulled it off.

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes, I willed it into existence, but there was a lot of mess to clean up.

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
After I hit that number, guys, I went into like a mental funk for like six

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
months, five to six months.

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And you can ask Francesca.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We closed down the office because of COVID.

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was like, inaccessible.

168
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Inaccessible, whatever the case is.

169
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I literally had like, it was weird.

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I went into this thing.

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I think because I just spent so much energy trying to get to these levels.

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
My systems weren't dialed in.

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I definitely didn't have everything in one place.

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
My attrition started to kick in, and I just couldn't maintain that 125K.

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We were able to maintain the 100K, but the 125 we were not, okay?

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I had a business.

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I had built a business that only ran with me in the middle, and it was freaking

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
exhausting.

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I had to be there.

180
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I had to run the show.

181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And the fact of the matter is, if somebody had come to me at that point and said,

182
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
hey, I want to buy your business, there is no way I could have sold that

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
business the way that it was set up.

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
There's just no way.

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Guys, let me just mention some of the tools that I was using at the time to try

186
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and scale.

187
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
SCM Rush, 129 bucks a month.

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Majestic, 50 bucks a month.

189
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Ahrefs, 129 bucks a month.

190
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Pipe Drive, Entreport, Salesforce, High Level.

191
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
These are some of the things that I've tried that worked, didn't work,

192
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
whatever.

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
High Level.

194
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Spent a lot of money on High Level, developing their app, whatever.

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Then we got the free stuff.

196
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We got the Google Sheets and the Google Docs.

197
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We got the Asana.

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We got Call Rail.

199
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That was a paid one.

200
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
We got Google Keyword Planner.

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And all these tools, guys, I've never been able to confidently recommend.

202
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Even when I built the training inside Digital Landlords, I just told people what

203
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
worked for me, but I told them with a grain of salt, this is what's working for

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
me now, but use whatever you want.

205
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I couldn't endorse anything because I had no control over it.

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I didn't know where the data came from, et cetera.

207
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And I did not have anything that I could recommend.

208
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And that is until now.

209
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Okay?

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And so what I'm going to be doing, I'm going to be bringing on Mr.

211
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Ryan Dalton right now, and then we're going to get into this call.

212
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm going to explain why we got him on this call and what we've got for you

213
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
guys.

214
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's going to be a real treat.

215
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay?

216
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, here we go.

217
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Where is he at?

218
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Ryan Dalton.

219
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What's up, Nick?

220
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Ryan Dalton, we got a full house today, bro.

221
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We got 87 people ready to rip on this call.

222
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
88.

223
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
How's that sound for a money?

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's a party, man.

225
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I love it, dude.

226
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I love it.

227
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay.

228
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So here's what we're going to do, guys.

229
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I want to make sure we give away some stuff really quick.

230
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What I'm going to do, actually, is I'm going to have Jason Allred.

231
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm going to have Jason Allred go through, and I'm going to have him select

232
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
based.

233
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Here's what I'm going to do.

234
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Anyone that's interested in a coaching call, a quick call with Donnie

235
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Dre slash Porter, I want you to drop, say, me or make a comment that

236
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
indicates you're interested.

237
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay?

238
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And I'm going to have Jason go in.

239
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm going to let him pick 10 winners so we can make sure that we're not

240
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
spending the entire time doing the giveaways, even though we're going to

241
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
give away all this stuff.

242
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So, Jason, if you are on right now, please indicate that you're hearing

243
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
me.

244
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll message him as well.

245
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But, Jason, I'm going to put you in charge of picking the 10 people.

246
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You'll have five that go to you.

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Five will go to Porter.

248
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Aaron Vogler says, Ryan's closing percentage is so high because of his

249
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
hair.

250
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I saw that, yeah.

251
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I love that.

252
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Lean in me, baby.

253
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I love that, dude.

254
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's so low maintenance.

255
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So, again, Jason Allred, hopefully you're on right now.

256
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't see him.

257
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm going to send him a, so I don't have to cop off of this.

258
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm going to send Jason a quick message.

259
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And then let's get into this call.

260
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't see him messaging yet.

261
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So I'm just going to send him a message to Jason.

262
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Hey, bro.

263
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Can you choose?

264
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, he's got it.

265
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He's got it.

266
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
All right.

267
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So Jason's going to choose 10 winners.

268
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's going to be our 10 coaching calls with Porter and Donnie Dre.

269
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Donnie Dre's at 13,600.

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Porter's at 9,400.

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And these guys are both people that have literally done this with no help

272
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
from me.

273
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I've never closed any Porter's deals.

274
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I've never given him a freebie.

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He's done this entirely alone.

276
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay?

277
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So that said, Ryan Dalton, you ready to get into this?

278
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah.

279
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
When do you announce on the Lamborghini giveaway?

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That one's coming.

281
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It really depends if we can get a thousand people on.

282
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
No, by the way, did you see that that Kai whatever is doing a live stream

283
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
for one month?

284
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
For a month long live stream.

285
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's crazy.

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He had it.

287
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah, that's a totally I don't even want to know some of the things that came

288
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
to my mind when I thought about that.

289
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But yes, a lot of Red Bulls.

290
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, it's a lot of Red Bulls.

291
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't know what's going to happen there.

292
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So, okay.

293
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So, Ryan, I know you're on this call.

294
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm going to just do a quick little preface.

295
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Let's get into this.

296
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Okay.

297
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So, guys, Ryan started a little over two years ago.

298
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You guys might have heard the story.

299
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You might not.

300
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Ryan's at $87,000 per month.

301
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Or what are you at right now?

302
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Are you at a little bit?

303
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
$87,000.

304
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah.

305
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I got a little bit.

306
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I had some churn.

307
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So I'm between $85,000 and $87,000.

308
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We've got a couple lined up this month.

309
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So we'll see how they go.

310
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So basically, Ryan's on the he's on a run rate right now to do a seven

311
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
figure year.

312
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
He's already made a million dollars collected into his agency in his first

313
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
two years.

314
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But we're talking about now he's on a run rate of a million dollars per

315
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
year agency.

316
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And, dude, I have no doubt in my mind you're going to blow my number out of

317
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
the water, which, again, is one of it's a compliment.

318
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So I'm stoked about that.

319
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Anyway, Ryan started two years ago.

320
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He wasn't in a weird spot with his job.

321
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
He loves his job.

322
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
He's got a great job.

323
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It pays him well.

324
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
He's got a beautiful house, beautiful family, great, like the perfect

325
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
American dream life, the actual American dream.

326
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But he realized, like, hey, well, let me go to the offense.

327
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm going to go and find something that I can control.

328
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And he did.

329
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
He did his research.

330
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You guys will notice today when you do the call, he's very analytical.

331
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
He's a very intelligent person.

332
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And he came across and fell into rank and rent.

333
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Anyway, long story short, two years later, he's scaled to eighty seven

334
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
thousand dollars per month.

335
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And this is the most impressive part, guys.

336
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He's kept his job.

337
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He's raised the family.

338
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He still does jujitsu.

339
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
He still travels to Brazil.

340
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I still see posts when he's hanging out with his kids.

341
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And it's been amazing to watch.

342
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
As I've watched him scale, I remember I would hit him up and be like,

343
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
dude, you're crushing it.

344
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You know, and how are you doing it?

345
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And I remember one day because he's a very organized person, very

346
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
systematic, he's like, well, let me show you.

347
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And he had put together like these different tools and everything was in

348
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
this very neat and organized place.

349
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And I was like, dude, can you do that for my agency?

350
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So he helped me out and he set mine up.

351
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And eventually this conversation came up like, dude, you should build this

352
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
for real, where it's an actual product that you can go in.

353
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
People can just click a button and then boom, it's it's it's up and running.

354
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And for the past 18 months, it's been about 18 months, right?

355
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Roughly.

356
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah, yeah.

357
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Fifteen.

358
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But, you know, all in conceptualization.

359
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Everything goes through it.

360
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Fifteen months development.

361
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Fifty, sixty thousand somewhere in that ballpark.

362
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah.

363
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Okay.

364
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
A lot of blood, sweat and tears has gone into this and it is incredible.

365
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm stoked to show you guys have Ryan show you guys this.

366
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So this is I called this live the only tool you need.

367
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And it is the only literally the only tool that I am using now.

368
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's going to and we're not I'm not we're going to try not to geek out too much

369
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and overwhelm you guys.

370
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But every single one of those tools that I mentioned, the pipe drive tool that I

371
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
mentioned that was a CRM that this does that the majestic that tells you how

372
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
many backlinks this does that I didn't even mention the SEO quake and the who is

373
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
sir like all these different tools.

374
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But every one of these tools that I was using, this will do it.

375
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
My favorite thing just as a teaser is doing the due diligence with this tool.

376
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The amount of time this would have saved me when I was doing this is incredible.

377
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So anyway, that said, guys, between the search volume, the ability to buy cheap

378
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
numbers through Twilio directly through the platform, the CRM, all of that stuff,

379
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
the due diligence tool, we're stoked to show you guys this.

380
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And again, if you'll stay till the end, we're going to be giving away a deal.

381
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We're going to have a deal for everyone that's on this call at the end that wants to

382
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
use this tool.

383
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I would highly recommend you say that on top of the giveaways and everything else.

384
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So, Ryan, give us a quick we're going to just quickly do this because I know we've

385
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
interviewed you, but give us just a quick anything that I missed about your story

386
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
about why you got into this.

387
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And maybe for people that are sitting there, they haven't even started rank and

388
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
rap.

389
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Why did you somebody that's a very intelligent person decide that this was the

390
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
model that you just said you wanted to get into?

391
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah, man.

392
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Well, first of all, thanks for having me on.

393
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Love being back on the call with the art of digital real estate.

394
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Made a lot of friends out of this group.

395
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So hey, everybody.

396
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Good to be on with you guys tonight.

397
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah.

398
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So why did I get into rank and rant?

399
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So I was looking for something that used the Internet scalable and repeatable

400
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and was actually passive.

401
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And there's a lot of people out there that talk about doing those things.

402
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And this is the model that I found that actually did that.

403
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So, you know, you put up a site, you put in the right market, you rank it, and

404
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
you rinse and repeat over and over again.

405
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And the numbers just made a lot of sense.

406
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And at first, I wasn't a true believer until I closed my first deal.

407
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I was like, oh, boy, I can do this.

408
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Like, this is this is a thing.

409
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And then just went from there.

410
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And he really went from there.

411
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Guys, just to put it in context, for those of you that are new, like I saw one

412
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
of my my who is a neighbor turned to a friend, Jared Mattson.

413
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He lives in St. George.

414
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Jared, I started if you're still on this call, I started in 2016.

415
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I didn't even make real money until 2020.

416
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It took me four years to start making real money.

417
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Ryan's done this in half the time.

418
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And I think there's a number of reasons.

419
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But one of the reasons I definitely think is because you're very systematized,

420
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
you're very organized, you're very like build it, build the foundation.

421
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Correct.

422
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And what we're going to show them today is what was part of and is part of your

423
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
your secret sauce, if you will.

424
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So, yeah, dude, let's let's talk about like, I think we just get into it, dude.

425
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I think I don't.

426
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Again, this is the only thing I'm I'm hesitant is I don't want to, like,

427
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
overwhelm people.

428
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I just want to show them a few things.

429
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But, guys, this like I just saw somebody like this said, does this replace go

430
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
high level a thousand times over?

431
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Dude, go high level is built for like digital whatever.

432
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
This is literally ace.

433
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Go ahead.

434
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Go ahead.

435
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
This is also not a go high level like white label.

436
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
There's some people that try to make some tool every now and then, and they

437
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
just like put a sticker on from go high level.

438
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This is like this is proprietary technology made for rank and rent by rank

439
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and renters.

440
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So when we made this, it was by me doing the business and then going to other

441
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
people who had version one of this and said, hey, what's working?

442
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What's not working?

443
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What do you like?

444
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What do you want?

445
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And people like, you know, like Mike, we used rank and range in one point.

446
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh, and, you know, I love that guy.

447
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And he is one of the people that gave me a lot of feedback like, hey, this is

448
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
what works.

449
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This is what I'm doing with my agency.

450
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
We built something that is made by the rank and rank community for the rank

451
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and rank.

452
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We're not like cobbling together all these tools from all these places where

453
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
they've got people to do SEO or people to do website.

454
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
There's a lot of general purpose tools.

455
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
There needs to be something made by our community that is doing this business

456
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
model.

457
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And it just didn't exist.

458
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Right.

459
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And so a lot of people are paying like a lot of like a lot of money to put

460
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
together tools that you need, like a piece of it.

461
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Right.

462
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You need a keyword planner.

463
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You need like some element of someone else's tool that is helpful for your

464
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
business, but there's a lot you don't need.

465
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So that's what we set out to do.

466
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Right.

467
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We wanted to build the all in one purpose built tool for people that do this

468
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
business model by people that do this business model.

469
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Exactly.

470
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And the best products, let's be honest, the best products and services

471
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
always come when someone gets into an industry.

472
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
They feel the pain points.

473
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
They see the pain points and they're like, Hey, I'm going to solve that issue.

474
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Good.

475
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Good.

476
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Quick example that we're going to get in and show these guys.

477
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm going to use a farming example.

478
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
One of the biggest pain points in farming with Alpha Alpha.

479
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Hey, Porter can testify to this is when you when you cut the crop, it's on the

480
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
ground, you turn it, it's dry.

481
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You have to wait for this perfect moisture.

482
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Right.

483
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
This perfect, the dew has to come in.

484
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And if it's too dry, the leaves fall off.

485
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
If it's too wet, you risk it lighting on like catching on fire, sitting in the

486
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
stack.

487
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And this company came along called Staley, Staley West.

488
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And they built a freaking dew machine that you literally pull on the back of

489
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
your tractor.

490
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And it literally allows you to go in the middle of the day if you want.

491
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And it creates a perfect moisture.

492
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You can bail with a perfect moisture.

493
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And they sell these machines at like two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

494
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Right.

495
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Per machine.

496
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And they're good.

497
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They're literally selling them like eggs off the shelf because it solved such a

498
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
pain point.

499
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But it took somebody in the industry realizing, hey, instead of waking up at 1

500
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
a.m. to check the dew temperature and then taking a nap and then checking it

501
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
again and doing this every year until you die, let's just create the product.

502
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The best products come from people in the industry that have had the pain, felt

503
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
the pain and developed them.

504
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So this is a rank and rent tool just for rank and rent built by rank.

505
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I know there's other people that are building tools.

506
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
They're like, yeah, there's a rank and rent.

507
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But you know what they're doing is they're going wide.

508
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
They're trying to get the digital market marketers that are doing SMMA and

509
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
doing this.

510
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
This is for rank and rent.

511
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Done.

512
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That's it.

513
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Why?

514
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And this is one other thing, dude.

515
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That shows you guys how confident Ryan and I are in this in this industry.

516
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Right.

517
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We're not hedging our bets saying, well, if rank and rent doesn't work, we can

518
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
go to this other ancillary market or this parallel market.

519
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
We are betting our entire futures on rank and rent.

520
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
This is built just for rank and rent.

521
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Okay.

522
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So it is catered to rank and rent the way that we do it.

523
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And I'm stoked about it.

524
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So Ryan, I'm going to give you co-hosts.

525
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I think you should just show them the freaking tool, by the way, the version

526
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
1.0, which took some setting up and, and, and, you know, duct taping some

527
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
tools together was kind of like your, your Petri dish.

528
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You had a 100 people that, that, that did it.

529
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah.

530
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah.

531
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
We had like 200 and tune.

532
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I forget the exact number.

533
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's on my website.

534
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I went and looked at it.

535
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
200 and something.

536
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah.

537
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's 200 and something people that built their agencies, usually 1.0.

538
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And it was so successful with 1.0 that we decided to really polish it and make

539
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
it something that's going to be really, really useful for people that doesn't

540
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
require all the setup.

541
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So we used to have to do a bunch of no code things to pull some things

542
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
together.

543
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And we got rid of that, right?

544
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
We just make it point and click kind of thing.

545
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So you want to get into it?

546
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Let's do it, bro.

547
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm stoked.

548
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Um, by the way, this is like one of, I don't have that many bookmarks.

549
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This is one of my bookmarks.

550
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Now I wake up, open it up and, uh, and I can see my tasks.

551
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Like, yeah, just show them.

552
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I just gave you co-hosts.

553
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So let's just get in the tool, dude.

554
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
All right.

555
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
All right.

556
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So I'm not, I'm going to say this up front, but we're not going to show you

557
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
the whole thing.

558
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Cause we don't have some fun stuff.

559
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We're going to show you some things that are going to make your lives easier

560
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and it would be more fun.

561
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Right.

562
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Cause that's a big part of doing this is having fun doing it.

563
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So.

564
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
All right.

565
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Here we are.

566
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So, uh, I'm going to start here and just, uh, kind of talk through what you

567
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
see on the left.

568
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We're not going to actually look at all of these cause we just don't have

569
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
time for it, but I'm talking about what all these do them to give you guys

570
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
some, uh, some due diligence.

571
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So if you guys want to drop a city and a niche into the chat, maybe someone

572
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
can keep an eye on it and we can go back and look at some options for due

573
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
diligence.

574
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
We do some live due diligence here with you guys.

575
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah, guys, let's get some city and niche options.

576
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
If you guys have any that maybe you're looking at, or maybe you have a niche

577
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and you want to try a different city, let's do that.

578
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And, uh, while Ryan's getting into it and then once, yeah, let's, let's go

579
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
from there.

580
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll have some people give some, some examples.

581
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Cool.

582
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So I pulled up a dummy account here.

583
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Um, and I'm going to show you guys, you know, when you log in on this left

584
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
sidebar, you can see all the features and this is has what is required to do

585
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
this business model.

586
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It allows all of your data to talk to each other in the right way, where you

587
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
have efficiency in the way that you build your agency.

588
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So the first is this task tracker, right?

589
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You've got to know what your goals are and you got to have at the task level

590
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
things that you're doing to move the needle, right?

591
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's the best way to describe that.

592
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And then you've got due diligence.

593
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So we're going to dig into some due diligence.

594
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm going to show you guys this.

595
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Uh, this is the work and have fun today.

596
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
We've got a site portfolio.

597
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
All your sites are in one spot, right?

598
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You can just put all the essential things you need to know about all your

599
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
sites and what stage development they're in prospects.

600
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You can pull in all your prospect information, what your goals are for your

601
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
prospects, your target subscription, right?

602
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's all right.

603
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Phone numbers, emails, your clients, you pull it on your cloud.

604
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I've got Michael Jackson is my client, right?

605
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Uh, we've got client information in here.

606
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So you've got a CRM, a lead tracker.

607
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So you can't see any doubt in here, but you pull in all your leads.

608
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Um, I've got a little rock concrete, all the calls, call recordings,

609
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
uh, you can, you know, annotate them with messages, goodbye tracking numbers.

610
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And the cool thing I love about this, that I love about this is the tracking

611
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
numbers you get in rank and run engine.

612
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Uh, you can set up automated SMS for your business owners to get a text

613
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
message when the lead comes in, which is the number one retention pool that

614
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I can impress upon you guys.

615
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Uh, and you've got a site analyzer, which I'll show you guys here in a

616
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
minute where you can break down your, your sites, uh, getting the SEO

617
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
information you need, and then a keyword tool to do manual keyword work.

618
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So let's just hold on Ryan real quick, because I, we kind of brushed

619
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
over that.

620
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah.

621
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Ryan is the master at low attrition.

622
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That's how he's been able to scale so rapidly.

623
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
His, his attrition is very, very low.

624
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I want you to just say that again about the number one thing that you can do

625
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
for keeping low attrition for, for decreasing churn just really quick.

626
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah, totally.

627
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
The number one thing, the absolute, I wouldn't even do rank and rent if I

628
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
didn't have this feature because I've, I have tested, um, markets where, or

629
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
websites that I have not enabled this.

630
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And then ones where I have enabled it and the retention is astronomically

631
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
higher.

632
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I don't have a number for you, but it is way, way higher.

633
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And that is the automatic SMS notification when a lead comes in.

634
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So, um, this is the configuration for this number for a little bit.

635
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
This is the configuration for this number for Little Rock Concrete, right?

636
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I don't actually own Little Rock Concrete.

637
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
That's, uh, I'm sure someone does, but, uh, you have a default SMS lead

638
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
notification down here, which basically just says, Hey, you have a new lead

639
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
from, and then it'll say Little Rock Concrete and it puts the caller's

640
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
number.

641
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So every time that business owner has a call that comes in, a lot of them

642
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
don't answer their phone.

643
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That's just the nature of these business owners.

644
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
They get a text message that says you have a new lead for Little Rock

645
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Concrete.

646
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
They know it came from me.

647
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So they don't think that, Oh, that came from my sources or someone, you

648
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
know, gave me that lead.

649
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
That wasn't this guy I'm paying for.

650
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
They know that it came from me.

651
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And all they have to do is scroll through their text messages to see how

652
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
many leads they got in the last month.

653
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And so that's enabled by default with a random retention.

654
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Tell me that, like, I guarantee if that, if there was a tool that just did

655
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
that and it costs $20 a month, that people would pay for that.

656
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah.

657
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Just that one little thing.

658
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
How many times?

659
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I want you guys, for those of you that have been doing this, how many times

660
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
have you had business owners?

661
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You're sending them 30 leads.

662
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You're sending them 50 leads a month.

663
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Even you're sending them 15 and they're, they just sound ungrateful.

664
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And it's, it's because they're, they're ignorant.

665
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
They don't even know the leads are coming from you.

666
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
This sounds so simple, but literally as soon as I could lead comes in, it's

667
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
just that constant reminder.

668
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Oh, that was Ryan.

669
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Oh, that was Nick.

670
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
All that was evergreen.

671
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And that was, and that right there will do so much more than a stupid report.

672
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Phone call checking on their kid and it's automated.

673
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's done.

674
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And that's just one tiny little thing that Ryan was basically skimming over.

675
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I just want to make sure that you guys heard that properly.

676
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So anyway, keep going.

677
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
A hundred percent.

678
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Yeah.

679
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That retention is essential.

680
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Like that, that is, that is the number one tool that I've used to get to

681
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
87,000 a month is they get a lead.

682
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
They get a text message.

683
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
They know it's from me.

684
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And so everything that comes in every month, I get credit for.

685
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Right.

686
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
They're never going to question it.

687
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And I can then use that to keep them.

688
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
If they ever call a complaint, Hey, I'm not getting enough leads.

689
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Like, Hey, let's pull up your text messages.

690
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Show me how many you got in the last 30 days.

691
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Right.

692
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And I'll count them.

693
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'll make them count them.

694
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Right.

695
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
One, two, three, four, like, Oh, I got 28.

696
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Like, all right, let's figure out what else is going on because it's not the

697
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
lead volume.

698
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Right.

699
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And that's what this tool enables.

700
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You can also do a custom notification.

701
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Right.

702
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And you can also do it like, Hello, you have a new lead from little rock

703
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
concrete.

704
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
This is evergreen leads.

705
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Thanks for being a great client or whatever, something goofy like that.

706
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Right.

707
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You can customize it.

708
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Amazing.

709
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Amazing.

710
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Okay.

711
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Sorry to stop your stop your flow.

712
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I just had to mention that it sounds like it's just like one little piece,

713
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
but it's such a valuable piece.

714
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So let's keep going.

715
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Yeah, totally.

716
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
All right.

717
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Just some due diligence.

718
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So this is, this is what I'm like.

719
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
This is what I've been geeking out on too.

720
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
They're geeking out on it.

721
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
This was the most fun part to build.

722
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Like I, this was a lot of hard work, but it was really fun to build this

723
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
part.

724
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So we're going to do some due diligence.

725
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
We're going to jump in here and do some live due diligence.

726
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And we're going to pipe in some real information in real time.

727
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So this screen is your due diligence.

728
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Empire mapping.

729
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Right.

730
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You've got to know where you're going to succeed and where you're not.

731
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And so what we pull in here.

732
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Okay.

733
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
So this is the, this is the, this is the, this is the, this is the,

734
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
this is the record.

735
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Automatically when you click a button is all the things that you need to

736
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
know to enter a market.

737
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Right.

738
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So I'm just going to point some things out here.

739
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You guys are smart.

740
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You guys can probably read this, but this record right here,

741
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
let's just grab one. Let's do like.

742
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
This is a paint one.

743
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Let's see.

744
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Hey,

745
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
does it let you zoom in a little bit? Can you like,

746
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Plus just to, yeah, I know it kind of skews a little.

747
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That's good right there. That's perfect.

748
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Cool.

749
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Let's do a.

750
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I got it. I got an example too. When you're ready, we can do this one.

751
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
We could do concrete contractor, Miami.

752
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Just because everyone's familiar with concrete Miami sounds fun.

753
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It sounds warm.

754
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So that, and Laura's always on the call. So let's do that one.

755
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
All right, Laura.

756
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Let's do it.

757
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
All right.

758
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
So here we're going to click add a record, right?

759
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So we're going to add location and this top right corner.

760
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So while I'm setting this up, we're going to need,

761
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm going to tell you guys what we need. All right.

762
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
We're going to need, we've got our location, Miami.

763
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
We've got our niche concrete.

764
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
We're going to need to grab the top three competitor domains.

765
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We'll get those in a minute.

766
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So right now, if you're overseas,

767
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
this is only for the United States for now. All right.

768
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
We're going to bring it to our buddies over in the UK, Canada,

769
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
in Australia.

770
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Right now it's just the U S so your country by default is going to be the

771
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
U S.

772
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
The state we're in through Florida.

773
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Our city.

774
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
We're going to do Miami, but look, here's what you guys need to know.

775
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
You guys are marketers. You guys run marketing agencies.

776
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
The Miami Fort Lauderdale DMA region is going to capture the greater

777
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Miami region.

778
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
This is your advertising region where you're going to have the highest

779
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
search volume. All right.

780
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So we're going to pull that in.

781
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Your niche is a lot of niches.

782
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You can add your own if you want to concrete contractor is a,

783
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
is a classic.

784
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So it's already in there.

785
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So we're going to put in all of our secondary keywords.

786
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So we're going to put in all of our secondary keywords.

787
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Call driven.

788
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Just a reminder. Like it's gotta be called driven guys.

789
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Primary keywords.

790
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Concrete contractor.

791
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And our school put all of our secondary keywords.

792
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
You're going to put in your core keyword list here, right?

793
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
These are your pop money keywords, right? So Sam concrete.

794
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Press enter.

795
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Everyone loves concrete drive.

796
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I think just concrete itself too. Right.

797
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
See concrete, concrete driveways, patios.

798
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Sidewalks are pretty good ones too.

799
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Concrete.

800
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Sidewalk. All right.

801
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So you've got six core keywords, right?

802
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So Nick teaches you guys to build your core keyword list.

803
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
We're going to grab some of those keywords.

804
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Put them in here. These are our money makers, right?

805
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
These are the ones with the highest search volume.

806
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Correct.

807
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And then this is the Miami area, right? So a pretty big area.

808
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
We know that upfront.

809
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
A lot of active businesses, like I don't have to look and I know that.

810
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So we're going to put many, if you're unsure, you can, you know,

811
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Nick's taught you guys.

812
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And me how to do your due diligence when looking at these businesses.

813
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So you can do your competitor analysis.

814
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
But here's where the money is going to be made for you guys.

815
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
All of those manual entries that you're doing to fill out spreadsheets,

816
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
to put in your competitor domain information.

817
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You're, you're not going to have to do that anymore.

818
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So if I do concrete contractor, Miami.

819
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm just going to grab the top three domains that I see.

820
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So I'm not going to pull a lot of thought into this,

821
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
but I'm just going to grab the ones.

822
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So, and let me say this while you're, while you're grabbing those.

823
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
What I, what I've been doing guys.

824
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I have my keyword list.

825
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So I have got my concrete concrete contractor, whatever.

826
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I opened the five, six windows.

827
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And before I start, I just type it in.

828
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I type in concrete Miami, Florida, concrete contractor, Miami, Florida.

829
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
All the way down.

830
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And then quickly, I just toggle between all six.

831
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And I go, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

832
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I grab the say, if it shows up in the organic.

833
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You know,

834
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
let's say four out of the seven times, four out of the six times.

835
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Boom. That's a top competitor.

836
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm dropping it in. It takes an extra two minutes.

837
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
That's how I do it to make sure that I'm getting, you know,

838
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
the right keywords, right competitors.

839
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But Ryan's doing this off screen just to kind of give you guys an idea.

840
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It takes two seconds, but it takes two seconds.

841
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah, so that's exactly right.

842
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So, you know, you guys want to go look at, you know, which,

843
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
which keywords these keep consistently pulling up for,

844
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
but we're going to pull it in those domains.

845
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Put them in right here. I'm just going to put in the.

846
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
All right.

847
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
The root level. All right.

848
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And then the available domain. So you go to go daddy, right.

849
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And whatever brand you're building, whatever your concrete,

850
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
whatever you call your concrete brand or your lead generation brand

851
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
that you're building, right.

852
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
We're just going to go look at that domain and do like concrete

853
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
contractor.

854
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Rose Miami.

855
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Right. So it's available, right? We checked. It's available.

856
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And the future we want to see is available.

857
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So we're going to go to go.

858
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Right.

859
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So it's available, right? We checked. It's available.

860
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And the future we want to make it to where you just buy this

861
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
straight in the platform,

862
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
but you got to make sure that the domain is available.

863
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Well,

864
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
we're going to put TBD go or no go put TBD and then you can put

865
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
comments here, right?

866
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
If you have a further new diligence,

867
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
everyone has their own little like take on due diligence.

868
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
You can put that in here.

869
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Hey, hold on.

870
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yeah.

871
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We're counting. Oh, it's done.

872
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I was going to have us count, bro.

873
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
The due diligence is done.

874
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
That's crazy, bro.

875
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Yeah. Like that. It's done. So due diligence is over for that record.

876
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Right. So here's what we've got here, guys.

877
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
We've got, you know,

878
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Up here.

879
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
We're indicating this is the name of the domain.

880
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
All right.

881
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So it's the first thing that you're building it or your VA or

882
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
however you're going to do it. Right.

883
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
That's the domain I want.

884
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Like my VA is building it.

885
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Go build this on this domain.

886
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Go buy it.

887
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Right.

888
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Here's our city. This is the DMA region.

889
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So it's the one.

890
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So it's the one.

891
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So it's the one.

892
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So it's the one.

893
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So it's the one.

894
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So it's the one.

895
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Right.

896
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Here's our city.

897
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
This is the DMA region.

898
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So it's the wider area.

899
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Right.

900
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Many active businesses,

901
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
concrete contractor,

902
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
the population will appear.

903
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
DMA region.

904
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So if you do the smaller area,

905
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
you can see what the population is,

906
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
but you're not going to need that when you do a DMA region,

907
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
because it's going to meet your criteria for sure.

908
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Your primary keyword up here.

909
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Right.

910
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And then over on the left, you know,

911
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
you can change these to your low-hanging fruit.

912
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Right.

913
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Like yes, no.

914
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Here's the cool stuff.

915
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Right.

916
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Your primary keywords.

917
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
The first thing over here on the left search volume of 1300.

918
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'd say that that that meets the due diligence.

919
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I think you're safe to go into Miami concrete on the,

920
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
on the search volumes.

921
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yeah.

922
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Yeah.

923
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah.

924
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
There's enough people looking for concrete Miami for sure.

925
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You see the calls per click.

926
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So seven 70.

927
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
For this keyword.

928
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Right.

929
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So pretty good.

930
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And then over here,

931
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
your secondary keywords all appear.

932
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So these are all of our money keywords that Nick trained you guys.

933
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Like which are the ones that are going to be your core keywords?

934
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
They're all pulled in right here.

935
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And we get the calls per click data that is as fresh as you can get it.

936
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
This is as accurate as you can get it.

937
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
If you get a not applicable or not known or whatever,

938
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
that means that it's just not available in Google.

939
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So we're pulling all that in here so that you can quickly make a decision.

940
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Is there enough search volume?

941
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
How much is it going to cost me?

942
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Now I want you to show the competitor analysis.

943
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And then I want to mention a couple of things on this guys.

944
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Well, let me say number one,

945
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
number one thing that I love about this,

946
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
it saves all the records.

947
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
How many times have you guys done a due diligence?

948
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You'll wait three months and you think of a city.

949
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You're like, dude,

950
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I think I did the due diligence on that and you're looking in your Google

951
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
drive or worse,

952
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
you're somebody like me and you did it on the freaking paper and you're

953
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
looking through your folders,

954
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
your Manila folders and you're in your little cabinet and you can't find it.

955
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So you go and you spend another 45 minutes.

956
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Everything saved.

957
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You can go look at it in two seconds.

958
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So go through the competitor analysis really quick as well.

959
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Just just quickly.

960
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You can just show these cards.

961
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It's crazy down here.

962
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Yeah.

963
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Yeah.

964
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So what do you grab these top three?

965
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So you got to know who you got to beat to get to the top.

966
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You want to rank organically.

967
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You got to know how you're going to get there.

968
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And so you can look at these top three competitors.

969
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So you put in that domain age, you put in,

970
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
you know, you put in their domain, right?

971
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And it's going to spit out immediately their domain age,

972
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
how many backlinks they've got, citation flow, domain authority,

973
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
page authority and trust flow.

974
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So the essential industry standard SEO metrics just pop right to the top and

975
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
we pull in that domain.

976
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So what we're doing is we're using a few APIs to pull that in at the same time.

977
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So when you had to go, it all pops up at once for you.

978
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
All right.

979
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So here's better one, two and three better.

980
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Better two has been there for a minute, right?

981
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
They're 28 years so that they've been around for a little while.

982
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
But you can see like quickly, like Captain Miami concrete contractor,

983
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
you can beat that guy like or gal, right?

984
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Like that is not, that is not hard to beat.

985
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So, you know, you can get into that top three and this is what you're able to

986
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
surface really quickly when you're able to pull the data into the right spot at

987
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
the right time.

988
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Here's another thing I like, guys.

989
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Let's say that you're doing concrete flat work and you decide, you know what,

990
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
that you get a new client or you're prospecting a new client and the new

991
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
client does a lot of decorative concrete and you want to go and you want to

992
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
quickly look in the same city, but you want to look at some different keywords.

993
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Show them how easy it is to quickly edit a keyword and rerun the search.

994
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Yes.

995
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You can just click edit, pop this out.

996
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Like if you wanted to do decorative concrete, add your new keyword, update

997
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
the location.

998
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Done.

999
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And there it goes.

1000
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
All right.

1001
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Decorative concrete, $2.00 a click.

1002
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I love that.

1003
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It feels good.

1004
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And that's actually hit the sweet spot, by the way.

1005
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So, guys, some people that haven't done the due diligence, like I've literally

1006
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
personally done over a thousand.

1007
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I can, I can definitively say I have done over a thousand freaking, I've probably

1008
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
done over 500 on a paper.

1009
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Right.

1010
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And I would like at my prime when I was really good at it.

1011
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Right.

1012
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And I had two monitors and the whole deal, I would get one done in like 22

1013
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
minutes or whatever the case was.

1014
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And I was super stoked, but it was frying my brain.

1015
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Right.

1016
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
We've been talking through this entire thing, chatting on chat.

1017
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
That took us like all of seven minutes.

1018
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And we're not even locked in.

1019
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Right.

1020
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
The amount of time that I have saved on due diligence is bananas.

1021
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
What it allows you to do is it allows you to look at way more cities.

1022
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It allows you to break down way more cities and niche combinations to find that

1023
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
perfect city.

1024
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I mean, dude, just for this, this is the thing that I've used the most and

1025
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
played around the most with.

1026
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And it's just a small part.

1027
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So anything else you want to cover on due diligence, any questions that people

1028
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
have on due diligence.

1029
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I saw that there's a couple of things that I wanted to address really quick.

1030
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
We've got a bunch of people that I recognize in the house here.

1031
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Let's see.

1032
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Simon says Ryan, Ryan Dalton out here selling shovels in a gold rush.

1033
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You know, it's funny about that is yes and no, because Ryan's an opportunist,

1034
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
but also at the same time, if you can't use that analogy because those people

1035
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
only sold shovels, this would be like somebody that had the mind that was

1036
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
making a lot of money, that was making the primary money from the mine and

1037
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
was like, Hey, I found this shovel that works better.

1038
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You should try it too, because there's an opportunity.

1039
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So I know what you're saying.

1040
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And yeah, there's an opportunity.

1041
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
We're not going to, we're going to call a spade a spade.

1042
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
However, Ryan makes his money from doing rank and rent the same way that I

1043
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
don't make my money from doing the program.

1044
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
That's not how I made millions of dollars doing the thing, selling and

1045
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
selling leads, renting simple websites.

1046
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Me and Ryan, before we ever opened our mouth about it, we made the million

1047
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
dollars, the multiple million dollars.

1048
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So, but yeah, of course it's a great opportunity.

1049
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So Chris says, yeah, I'm in the mine with you.

1050
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm down there.

1051
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
We're all in the mine together and I'm tired of having bad tools down in the

1052
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
mine.

1053
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Exactly.

1054
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And I'm all about people with good tools.

1055
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And if someone wants to come with like a superior sandwich that is dust proof,

1056
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
whatever, I'll buy that too.

1057
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So there's, you know, it's all about opportunity here.

1058
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Okay.

1059
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Real quick.

1060
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Chris says in this example, what stands out about those data points, good or

1061
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
bad, et cetera.

1062
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Let's, let's answer that question and then let's move to a couple of their

1063
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
features and then give away some t-shirts.

1064
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
For sure.

1065
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Yes.

1066
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
We'll breeze right through that.

1067
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
There's some great training on that.

1068
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Like I got to give a shout out to Nick's training.

1069
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Like he, he dives into all this stuff.

1070
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
If you're, if you're not taking that, you should, because you can get really

1071
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
what these metrics mean, right?

1072
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
These are the metrics that allow you to assess if you have a viable market.

1073
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So let's look at this one.

1074
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
We got up right here, right?

1075
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
So competitor three is Captain Miami Concrete Contractor.

1076
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So you, you have to know what it's going to take for you to beat this

1077
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
website to rank higher than them.

1078
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
That's the purpose of the competitor analysis.

1079
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
The older a domain is and the higher the numbers are in those other metrics,

1080
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
the harder they are to beat.

1081
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
So a domain that is less than a year old.

1082
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Is way easier to beat than one that's 28 years old.

1083
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Right?

1084
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So you're able to look at these and say, Hey, am I going to be able to do

1085
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
what it takes to get in those top three spots or another example?

1086
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And we're not going to go through all of them.

1087
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You could do a whole hour on just this, but backlinks, this guy has three.

1088
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Okay.

1089
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
You could do three backlinks before this call in, if you know how to do

1090
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
them, but this guy has 1600.

1091
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And so that indicates to me that they'd gotten SEO guy that helps their

1092
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
concrete company.

1093
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Right?

1094
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So now I'm battling this SEO guy to be competitor number two.

1095
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
So each of these metrics will give you insights into what it's going to

1096
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
take for you to win.

1097
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And that's what I'm about.

1098
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I want to win, baby.

1099
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And I want to win fast.

1100
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And so I want to know what it's going to take to do that.

1101
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And that's what due diligence does for you.

1102
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
A hundred percent.

1103
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And just so you guys know, also, this is what's so cool about Ryan having

1104
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
developed this tool is like this, it's not going to be a hundred percent

1105
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
perfect out the gate.

1106
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
There's going to be things and we're getting feedback as we go.

1107
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
We're building like adding changing.

1108
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Like one thing I think that would be really valuable.

1109
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I've talked to Ryan about is if we had a way that you could click on the

1110
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
backlinks and it could open up the backlink profile, because we know that

1111
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
backlinks aren't created equal there.

1112
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You could have three good backlinks could be better than 1600.

1113
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So we understand that if it's a competitive niche, you might have to go

1114
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
and you have to analyze those backlinks.

1115
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That's something that we can add because Ryan is overseeing the development

1116
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
of this.

1117
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So real quick, I'm going to give away some t-shirts and then let's get into

1118
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
a couple of the features.

1119
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Reggie.

1120
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So what I'm going to do, Ryan, sorry, Aaron Vogler, if you're on, please

1121
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
help us.

1122
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And just so you can note who's the winners here, but I'm going to give away

1123
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
some t-shirts.

1124
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Reggie Klassen met Reggie in Sierra Leone of all places back in 2010.

1125
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And he's on this call.

1126
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I'm going to give him a t-shirt and you can choose which one you want.

1127
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
What you guys will do if you guys are a winner of the swag, you're going to

1128
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
message Aaron.

1129
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Aaron's going to send you a coupon code.

1130
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You go in.

1131
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
It's completely free shipping and all.

1132
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Get your pick your size.

1133
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
We'll ship directly to your house.

1134
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So we got Reggie Klassen.

1135
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
We've got let's give away.

1136
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
If anyone stands out to you, let me know, Ryan.

1137
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Let's.

1138
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Santos.

1139
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Santos.

1140
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
A t-shirt.

1141
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Who?

1142
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Santos.

1143
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Santos.

1144
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
What's the last name?

1145
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Garza.

1146
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Santos Garza t-shirt winner.

1147
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Let's see.

1148
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Who else?

1149
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I saw a really good comment that I wanted to give because I liked that.

1150
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
The comments seem good.

1151
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
All right.

1152
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Right here.

1153
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Where the hell was we got a lot of comments coming in?

1154
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Jason Bertok.

1155
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
You know, you don't, if you don't ask, you don't receive.

1156
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
He says he wants a t-shirt.

1157
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Give him a t-shirt.

1158
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Let's give Jason Bertok.

1159
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
You know, everyone's going to start dropping that.

1160
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Let's see.

1161
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Who else we got?

1162
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Let's give Morgan Williams t-shirt winner.

1163
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Size XL, by the way.

1164
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
These are great.

1165
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Versatile t-shirts.

1166
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
No, I'm just kidding.

1167
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
We don't make money on t-shirts.

1168
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
We don't make shit.

1169
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
We don't make money on t-shirts.

1170
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
These are just for fun.

1171
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I only go shirtless.

1172
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Okay.

1173
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
You know what, Landon, just because of that comment, I think we're going to give Landon

1174
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
t-shirt.

1175
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Landon t-shirt winner.

1176
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
He just used the reverse psychology, the reverse.

1177
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Let's give away one more.

1178
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Mason Black says he wears large.

1179
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
That's an assumptive sale.

1180
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Let's freaking go.

1181
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Mason Black.

1182
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
That's t-shirt winner.

1183
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
There's five.

1184
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
We'll give away some more guys.

1185
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
We still have to give away the headphones.

1186
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
We still got to give away a couple of partial scholarships.

1187
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Let's go through a couple more things in our last 10 minutes here.

1188
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Ryan.

1189
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Yeah, for sure.

1190
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
All right.

1191
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I think we saw a question earlier about data privacy.

1192
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Look, no one sees this.

1193
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
We take data privacy really seriously.

1194
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I'm not in here stealing your due diligence.

1195
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I've got my own agency planned out for the next year.

1196
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I'm not in here ordering your due diligence records.

1197
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Due diligence is sacred.

1198
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It's your agency building your future.

1199
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It's building your rank and run empire.

1200
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And so data privacy is something that I'm a very like private privacy

1201
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
oriented person so that we built the software in accordance with that.

1202
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
We also are pulling this data straight from the pipe guys.

1203
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
You're not getting more accurate keyword research anywhere else.

1204
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
So let me show you guys what I mean by this.

1205
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
So this is a site analyzer.

1206
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And so we're going to do that site.

1207
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Let's just grab that domain that was old.

1208
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
What's that?

1209
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
C E C O concrete.

1210
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
All right.

1211
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So they've been around a minute.

1212
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So you go in here and see like, all right, what am I up against?

1213
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And we're going to pull all that information in, right?

1214
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
We're going to do a little bit more of a deep dive.

1215
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So right here from the top, we've got citation flow, trust flow, domain authority and page authority.

1216
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Like these are the top four metrics that we look at.

1217
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And beneath them, you see our backlinks and backlinks over time.

1218
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Give us a picture of how much attention they're putting into being competitive.

1219
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So down here, you can see for the year, right, they're working on stacking these backlinks.

1220
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Like they got someone that knows what they're doing that's involved.

1221
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So that's an indication to me that that's going to be pretty tough.

1222
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Right.

1223
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And you can see another detail about their backlink information here, where they're referring, all that kind of stuff.

1224
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
We're not going to get into all that, but I'll give you guys what I mean.

1225
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Let's grab this other one.

1226
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So if you want to go deep dive captain Miami, that's just a wild name.

1227
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
All right.

1228
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
That's like one of those massage parlor type of things.

1229
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm not sure that's a concrete company.

1230
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yeah, I don't know what that is.

1231
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So this guy, look, look, you guys see the difference in these numbers you guys see up here.

1232
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
We're returning some low numbers, right?

1233
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Low backlinks, lost backlinks.

1234
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
This is going to be easier to beat three referring domains.

1235
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,000
You can do a deep dive and look at, hey, are they actually doing what it takes to stay in that spot?

1236
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Or can I go win?

1237
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So you can analyze all your competition.

1238
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:26,000
You can see their anchor text and referring domains and all that kind of stuff that you guys are probably paying a lot of money for with fancy tools right here with your keyword planner.

1239
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
This would be a majestic type of a tool, which would cost you $50 per month, just as a heads up.

1240
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Now, it doesn't do everything majestic does yet, but that's something that we can work towards with showing, you know, more of the backlink profile and going in a deep dive like that.

1241
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But anyway, dope.

1242
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Can you show them the the project management piece, which I love?

1243
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
You know what I love about it?

1244
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I'll just pop in there.

1245
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Sometimes I'll see something like, for example, we have this GMB that wasn't ranking and it was in one of our locations that we have.

1246
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
We're making a decent amount of money.

1247
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Oh, your screen got smooshed like this.

1248
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I think it's just maybe unshare and share again.

1249
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
It looks like it's like that big.

1250
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I don't know.

1251
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Just went dark.

1252
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I don't know what happened here.

1253
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I'm going to come back.

1254
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
No, try it again.

1255
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Anyway.

1256
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Okay, that's better.

1257
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I'll go in and I went in the other day and I went in.

1258
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I put like optimize GMB get three reviews by end of week and I assigned it to Francesca just to kind of piss her off because she basically runs the company and she was humble about it.

1259
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
She actually didn't even say a word.

1260
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
She completed the task, moved the card over and it was done.

1261
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,000
So anyway, I love the project management task tracker is super nice, too.

1262
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yeah, so I mean, I built this.

1263
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I've had over 3000 tasks that we've done in the last year that I write for myself or I write for my team or, you know, I'm big on knowing like what is the actual specific thing that I have to do to move the needle.

1264
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Like this is the Hormose thing.

1265
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Like what's required and I put what's required into my task tracker.

1266
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So you can see that we've got four columns.

1267
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Here's what I got to do.

1268
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Here's what I'm doing in progress.

1269
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Here's what I finished.

1270
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And here's where I'm stuck.

1271
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And that's the backlog.

1272
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Right.

1273
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So this is a pretty straightforward project management tool, but it ties in with other agents.

1274
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
You're not full sheets or Trello or whatever.

1275
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
You're doing it right here in the tool.

1276
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
So what's our task?

1277
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
We need to optimize GVP.

1278
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Right.

1279
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And then you put in your details where you need to do.

1280
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Right.

1281
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So, you know, add photos, make posts and reply to reviews.

1282
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:58,000
And then you add, you know, whatever you can add images or documents or pictures or videos or whatever you need to add to like, you know, make sure that that task has the data that it needs to be completed.

1283
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Assigned prioritization.

1284
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
This is very high priority.

1285
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
You can add labels.

1286
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Right.

1287
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
This is GVP optimization.

1288
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Probably going to add this one.

1289
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So we're going to add a new label.

1290
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Right.

1291
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I'm the owner.

1292
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Right.

1293
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
It's just me.

1294
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
But you can also have people at sub account users.

1295
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So I've got me and then I have my agency.

1296
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Nick would have him and then Francesca and everybody else is there.

1297
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So you're going to assign them, you know, sub user.

1298
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I've got a sub user.

1299
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I call them that.

1300
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
A task is useless without a deadline.

1301
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Right.

1302
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
We're going to do this by Friday.

1303
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And then some people like to color code.

1304
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And so we just fill up this with everything that we need to do that's required.

1305
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Right.

1306
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And just chip away at it to move the needle forward over and over and over.

1307
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And then that's how the revenue comes in.

1308
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Sorry, I'm over here just trying to answer as many questions as possible.

1309
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Yeah, I know there's going to be a lot of questions that people have.

1310
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
One thing that we're going to be doing is a separate Facebook group for

1311
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
just people that are on this tool.

1312
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You can go in, you can ask questions.

1313
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
There's going to be trainings, et cetera.

1314
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Because I know there's going to be a lot of questions, but real quick.

1315
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
We have that.

1316
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yeah.

1317
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
You can join my Facebook group.

1318
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Right.

1319
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
So rank and run engine is the Facebook group and you can jump in.

1320
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And if you guys want to join that, ask questions or whatever.

1321
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I think you were saying that they're asking about that kind of thing.

1322
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Yeah.

1323
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Well, like I just saw some questions that were very specific.

1324
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I mean, we could spend two hours answering questions and they're there.

1325
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Some of them are simple questions.

1326
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I just was letting them know that there is a Facebook group.

1327
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
There's ongoing support, et cetera.

1328
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
What I would like to do really quick though, because I do want to respect

1329
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
everyone's time and maybe what we'll do is let's announce the winner.

1330
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Let's choose a winner of the headphones.

1331
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Let's give out the discount code.

1332
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I'm going to let everyone know about the scholarship and then let's stay on

1333
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
for like maybe five, 10 minutes to answer a few questions and then we'll pop

1334
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
off. That way people that need to go can go.

1335
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Just respect that.

1336
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Okay.

1337
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
So we did the t-shirts.

1338
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
What's the deal?

1339
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So what's the deal?

1340
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Let's talk about the promo for those that are on this call that join.

1341
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I think that we talked about like this will go through at least the next

1342
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
24 hours.

1343
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
This promo code that you're going to be giving.

1344
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Now there are a few people I want to mention this that may have been in,

1345
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
you know,

1346
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
my community inside digital landlords that you guys have the ability to have

1347
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
you're part of our beta group.

1348
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
This can they can still like kind of doubt they can kind of double dip and

1349
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
get this as well.

1350
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Correct.

1351
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Yeah. They didn't sign up for beta,

1352
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
which I really appreciate that by the way,

1353
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
if you were a beta user and you're in digital landlords,

1354
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
they helped me find kind of the edge cases to work out.

1355
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Right.

1356
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
And I really appreciate that.

1357
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
That meant a lot to me.

1358
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
But now we're opening this up to the wider rink and rent community,

1359
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
starting here as an exclusive and artificial real estate.

1360
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
And we have a promo code for this group.

1361
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
That's if all caps landlord 24,

1362
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
we'll give you 20% off for your first two months of whatever plan that you

1363
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
get,

1364
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
or it'll give you 20% off for the year if you wanted to get a plan for the

1365
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
year, which is a real steal.

1366
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
That is exclusive for you guys here in artificial real estate.

1367
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Landlord 24 all caps landlord, the number 24, right?

1368
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
That man. Yeah. Yep.

1369
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Okay.

1370
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Go ahead.

1371
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Yeah.

1372
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Landlord 24 and join our Facebook group.

1373
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
It's just called rink and rent engine.

1374
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
We're in there talking about how to build the agency.

1375
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's a good time.

1376
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I love it.

1377
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Okay. Two more things.

1378
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
We mentioned that we're going to be doing two skull,

1379
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
two partial scholarships for digital landlords.

1380
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
We're going to be doing two,

1381
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
two partial scholarships for digital landlords.

1382
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And we're going to be doing two,

1383
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
two partial scholarships for digital landlords.

1384
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And we're going to be doing two on that because I want to actually

1385
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
pick people that I think are going to succeed and have the best chance of

1386
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
succeeding.

1387
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
For that one specifically,

1388
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
if that is something that you are interested in again,

1389
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
it's just going to be two, it's going to be a partial.

1390
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It's not going to be completely free.

1391
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
It's just going to be two winners.

1392
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
It's going to be a partial,

1393
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
but that is something that we are going to be including.

1394
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
So that's the scholarship piece.

1395
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Now, as for the air, the, the Apple,

1396
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
air pod max there,

1397
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I think they're like 580 bucks, something like that.

1398
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I've actually never used them, but everyone I know that has them,

1399
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
loves them.

1400
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I don't know if that's cause everyone's just like.

1401
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Fanatical about Apple or not, but right.

1402
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
They're awesome.

1403
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Oh, you have them. You have them. Amazing. Okay.

1404
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Okay. So there we go. So Ryan, let's,

1405
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I think we should ask a relevant question or completely irrelevant.

1406
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
And based on the answers, let's pick somebody. So let's, I'm going to let you,

1407
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
whether it's a rank and rent related question,

1408
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
whether it's a purpose driven question,

1409
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
whether it's something completely off the wall,

1410
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
what question should we let people and guys,

1411
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
what we're going to do is we're going to have you guys,

1412
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
we're going to give you like one minute answer in the comments.

1413
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And from those comments, we're going to be choosing a winner.

1414
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Now don't be that person that fricking drops 15 comments or I'm going to not

1415
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
choose you. Um, what should, what's, what's the question, right?

1416
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
And by the way, we didn't come in with a plan.

1417
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
We just thought we kind of go with the flow on this. What should we ask?

1418
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
You know, you know what I love hearing from people.

1419
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I love hearing what their why is.

1420
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Why you're what.

1421
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
A rank in rent agency. What's your reason for doing that?

1422
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
That I love getting answers to that question.

1423
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I love that. So what we're going to do, we're going to take two minutes.

1424
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
If you've been on this call so far,

1425
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
we've got 74 people stay on for like four minutes because we're going to be

1426
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
giving away these Apple AirPods. Um, we don't, we're not,

1427
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
it's not one of those fixed ones. We've got somebody in mind.

1428
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
We're going to try and fix this thing. Why are you here?

1429
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Why do you want to build a rank and rent empire like Ryan and I have done?

1430
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And again, it's, it's amazing. We started out with this idea.

1431
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Ryan's scale up to 87,000 a month.

1432
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I was able to scale up to a hundred and haven't looked back. Uh,

1433
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
and we are, we had our wives.

1434
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
My wife was I wanted to be able to travel the world and make money for my

1435
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
laptop and give my family and myself experiences that I never got.

1436
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And that, that no one got like most people did it. And, uh,

1437
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
that's what I'm doing. I'm literally in Dubai right now.

1438
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I've been able to move my family to Africa twice.

1439
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I've been able to literally do exactly what I set out to do.

1440
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
That was my wife.

1441
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And it just, for some reason,

1442
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I wanted to scratch that itch and it's still not completely scratched

1443
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
because I'm still on it, but everyone's is different.

1444
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
So we're going to go through. You got one minute. Why?

1445
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
And we're not going to go off with length, but if you, if it's lengthy,

1446
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
that's fine. Why are you here?

1447
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Why do you want to build a rank and rent agency?

1448
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Let's see what we got. Okay.

1449
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Uh,

1450
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
let's see, by the way,

1451
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I do see some additional questions for the tool.

1452
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
As soon as we announced this winner,

1453
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
we're going to spend about five to seven minutes answering a couple more

1454
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
questions. So we just want to let everybody that needs to get off,

1455
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
hop off. Okay.

1456
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Okay.

1457
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Let's see.

1458
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Where are we at?

1459
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Dude, we got a lot of comments going here.

1460
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I love this, man.

1461
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
We're getting rapid fire. This fires me up.

1462
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I know, dude. I love it.

1463
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Uh, okay. Eric, it's 3 45 a.m.

1464
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
where I am setting alarm just to get all these amazing insights have to

1465
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
work in three hours, but it's still worth it.

1466
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Dope shit. Scholarship would be awesome. Okay. Awesome.

1467
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Uh, Eric,

1468
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Me too, bro. I went to bed at 2 a.m.

1469
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
4 30. My alarm went off and I, uh,

1470
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I even drove to this office space so I could.

1471
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Make sure I could scream and not wake anybody else.

1472
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Um, let's see.

1473
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Where the hell are these?

1474
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Why is that? We got a lot. Okay.

1475
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Wyatt says, why am I family of five?

1476
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Eating.

1477
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Uh,

1478
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Uh, my wife has celiac is hella expensive.

1479
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Okay.

1480
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
What else?

1481
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I'm investment banking.

1482
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Hate my job, right?

1483
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
And I'm going to let you kind of scan through those.

1484
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Right.

1485
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I'm going to let you scan through those.

1486
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I'm going to scan through those.

1487
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I'm going to scan through those.

1488
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I'm going to scan through those.

1489
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Right.

1490
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I'm going to let you kind of scan through those really quick.

1491
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I'm going to let you choose the winner.

1492
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
This is your show today, bro.

1493
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I'm just,

1494
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I'm just the,

1495
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I'm just here,

1496
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
the facilitator,

1497
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
but this is your show.

1498
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I'm going to let you kind of scan through.

1499
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And what I want you to do,

1500
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I want to have you pick the top three.

1501
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
We're going to do the headphones for the top one.

1502
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Uh,

1503
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
and then I'll give away some swag to the other two.

1504
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So at least we have the top three winners.

1505
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
You see three that you like.

1506
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
And give this away.

1507
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
All right.

1508
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I got three.

1509
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Boom.

1510
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Go.

1511
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Who are you doing?

1512
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Read the answers.

1513
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
So I,

1514
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I like,

1515
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
uh,

1516
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I like Eric getting up in the middle of the night.

1517
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Cause he's got a dream.

1518
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Like I am all about that.

1519
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I love that.

1520
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
That,

1521
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
that fires me up.

1522
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Uh,

1523
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Wyatt,

1524
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
like if you've got medical things,

1525
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,000
nothing makes a man hungrier than something medical in their family.

1526
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Right.

1527
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I'm going to,

1528
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I'm going to solve this.

1529
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
My wife has,

1530
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
uh,

1531
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
gluten intolerance,

1532
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
right?

1533
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
She can't eat bread and stuff like that.

1534
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It's not celiac,

1535
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
but,

1536
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
uh,

1537
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
that,

1538
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
that is,

1539
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
uh,

1540
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
that's the,

1541
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
you gotta,

1542
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
you gotta take serious for sure.

1543
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Cause she's gonna have problems later on in life.

1544
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I respect that a lot.

1545
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And then,

1546
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
uh,

1547
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Katie's talking about her daughters,

1548
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I think daughter,

1549
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
daughters,

1550
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
two of them.

1551
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I got a little girl and I do anything for my little girl.

1552
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
And so,

1553
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
uh,

1554
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
when you arrive home in the middle of the night,

1555
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
you got medical stuff to solve.

1556
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
You got,

1557
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
you know,

1558
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
little girl,

1559
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
like those are,

1560
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
those are the ones that pull on my heart.

1561
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
So those are my answers for those three.

1562
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
So,

1563
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
um,

1564
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I vote,

1565
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I didn't even see any of those answers because it was going too fast.

1566
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
But,

1567
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
um,

1568
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Let's,

1569
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
let's let everyone vote.

1570
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Who do you think out of those three winners?

1571
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
We got Katie with her daughters.

1572
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
We got Eric.

1573
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,760
with Wakin' Up, and we've got Wyatt

1574
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,260
with health issues inside the family.

1575
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,040
Real quick, who do you guys, let's let everybody vote.

1576
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,900
Who's the winner out of the three?

1577
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,560
Katie, Wyatt, Eric, just drop a name.

1578
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,480
Katie, Wyatt, Eric, we're gonna give,

1579
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,080
who won the headphones, two, a couple of people,

1580
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,280
pieces of swag, and then we're gonna get

1581
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,120
a little bit more Q&A.

1582
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,120
What do we got here?

1583
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,960
I'm seeing some Katie's popping in.

1584
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,700
Katie, Katie, Katie, Katie.

1585
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,200
Wyatt, Katie, because same girl.

1586
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,860
Gotta go, good stream, Katie.

1587
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,000
I think it's Katie, dude.

1588
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,840
Yeah, there's a lot.

1589
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,140
Yeah, Katie's the winner.

1590
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,500
Okay, Katie, you are the winner.

1591
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,400
What I'm gonna have you do, and by the way,

1592
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,280
Wyatt, Wyatt and Eric, you guys are swag winners.

1593
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,520
I know that Eric was also looking at,

1594
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,120
talking about a scholarship.

1595
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,720
Message me if you guys were interested in the scholarship.

1596
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,560
You guys can message me

1597
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,360
with why you think you should win it.

1598
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:09,480
Katie, message, Aaron, and we will get you the,

1599
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,720
either order the headphones directly to your location

1600
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,120
or just Venmo you the money.

1601
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,600
You can do it for those headphones, but you enjoy those.

1602
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,480
Thanks for being on the stream.

1603
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,520
Eric, Wyatt, you guys are gonna win

1604
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:24,000
the Digital Landlord t-shirts,

1605
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,560
and you'll get those shipped to your house as well, okay?

1606
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,080
Beautiful.

1607
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,360
Yeah, Katie, Katie is the clear winner.

1608
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,700
I love that, and I appreciate you guys with your feedback.

1609
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:36,000
So let's go, let's do seven minutes.

1610
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,840
We're gonna answer a couple more questions,

1611
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,640
and then Ryan, let's hop off this call.

1612
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:42,160
But again, guys, I'm gonna type this one more time.

1613
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,800
If you didn't already, we've got a code,

1614
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,800
LANDLORD24, if you guys want to get the promo,

1615
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:53,800
that's gonna be good for at least 24 hours.

1616
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,540
Depending on how that goes, we might extend it.

1617
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:58,980
We'll see, but let's go through a couple of questions

1618
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,820
that we had from the actual software side, okay?

1619
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,260
But guys, real quick, for those that were on this call,

1620
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:07,700
just wanna say thank you.

1621
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:11,600
We had, I saw at one point, 97 people.

1622
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,500
That means a lot to us.

1623
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,820
We know you guys have a lot of stuff going on,

1624
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:17,260
and we don't take that lightly.

1625
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:21,940
So I think this was a really awesome call, lots of value.

1626
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,900
Got me pumped, it always does.

1627
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,340
Every time I'm on with Ryan, I get pumped,

1628
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,700
but we just appreciate you guys being on the call.

1629
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:31,380
So just wanted to say that really quick.

1630
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,640
For sure, yeah.

1631
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:37,500
Let's see, let's go through a couple of questions real quick.

1632
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,700
Kurt Dahlstrom has the best question.

1633
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,220
He says, one question you have to ask yourself,

1634
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,340
Amex or Visa?

1635
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:47,500
Yeah, assume the close.

1636
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,200
I love that, okay.

1637
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:53,620
Okay, let's go.

1638
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,700
Justin Taylor says, will there be any form trackers as well,

1639
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,980
or just phone calls only?

1640
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,340
I think right now it's just phone calls,

1641
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,380
but eventually, is there gonna be form trackers?

1642
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,540
Is that something on the list?

1643
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:05,100
Is it not on the list?

1644
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,500
Yeah, so we do forms, and then we have a lead,

1645
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,340
like a forum for inputting the leads,

1646
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,620
if you're the one answering the phone,

1647
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:15,420
or if you're a VA, or setter, or however you wanna do it.

1648
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:20,260
Piping in a form through a API call, or a webhook,

1649
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:23,380
from a, like whatever one of your sites are.

1650
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:24,980
Something that we wanna do.

1651
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:28,060
It just is not something that is in this first version.

1652
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:33,260
Keep in mind, guys, this is version 1.0.

1653
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,700
There will be many, many versions to come,

1654
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,580
but right now, I think for a version 1.0,

1655
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:40,820
this thing is pretty darn robust, in my opinion.

1656
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,180
Yeah, we worked really hard on it,

1657
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,140
and the cool thing about this is,

1658
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:45,780
you guys are help building this.

1659
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:48,980
So this is something that, as we get feature requests,

1660
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,780
this is not a done thing.

1661
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,660
As we get feature requests,

1662
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:54,180
we're gonna take those feature requests

1663
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:55,260
that everybody's asking for,

1664
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:56,900
and say, this is what we're building, right?

1665
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,940
I have a call every week, with developer,

1666
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,420
and you guys help build that vision,

1667
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,180
because you say, hey, here's what we want,

1668
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:07,220
and so it's still being built by the rank and rank community,

1669
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:10,380
and it's still an ongoing thing

1670
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,140
for development of this platform.

1671
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,580
Anthem says, are the sub-users able to log in

1672
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,780
with their own login, or do they use ours?

1673
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:20,140
This is awesome.

1674
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:22,100
Yes, yeah, they log in with their own.

1675
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,020
You can have your own sub-users.

1676
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,020
PJ asks, do we have a call tracking service,

1677
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:26,860
or does this tool does that?

1678
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:28,700
Yeah, this does everything voice.

1679
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:31,020
This is all programmed on auto.

1680
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:35,060
You don't have to use CallRail or any of those others.

1681
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,620
It's built all right in here together for you guys.

1682
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:41,780
Dustin says, would you recommend this for someone

1683
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:45,100
just starting out with a couple of sites and no deals yet,

1684
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,620
or someone that has deals already?

1685
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:48,540
I'm curious your answer on that, Ryan.

1686
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:51,900
Yeah, absolutely, because even if you don't have

1687
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,100
a deal yet, you still have to figure out

1688
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,820
where you're gonna build your website.

1689
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,940
You have to figure out which market you're gonna win in.

1690
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,780
You have to have a phone number

1691
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,460
that's gonna put on the website.

1692
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,180
You gotta have the tools set up to succeed

1693
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:05,340
once you can close that first business owner.

1694
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:07,660
This is made for everyone from,

1695
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:10,060
I'm just starting rank and rent today,

1696
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:14,020
to I have an agency with 150 websites like I do.

1697
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:18,140
And I think too, and the question also might be

1698
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,220
a little deeper, basically asking like,

1699
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:22,780
is it worth the money at this point?

1700
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:27,020
And I think, look, I think the local plan's like 97 bucks

1701
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:29,940
with that discount, you're at 70 bucks.

1702
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,660
You have to use something anyway.

1703
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:33,540
You're gonna have to use some kind of tool.

1704
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:35,500
Semrush is 129.

1705
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:39,460
That's just that tool.

1706
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:42,740
But also, I always think about this in terms of time.

1707
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:45,300
If you guys haven't done due diligence,

1708
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,980
go do five due diligence and then come sign back up

1709
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:51,180
for rank and rent engine because you guys are gonna wanna

1710
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,900
literally poke needles in your eyes.

1711
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,020
It is tough.

1712
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:56,620
It is freaking tough.

1713
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:57,700
It takes time.

1714
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,060
And from somebody that's literally done

1715
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:01,980
over a thousand themselves, I swear to you,

1716
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,900
that feature alone is worth 100 bucks a month.

1717
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,220
Like easy for me.

1718
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:10,220
Because I'm saving, dude, I'm saving 23 to 50 minutes.

1719
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:12,980
I bet my first due diligence took me an hour.

1720
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:14,220
So when you're first starting,

1721
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:16,900
you're saving 50 minutes a rip.

1722
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:19,660
You do that for the first 10, 20.

1723
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,500
Like what's your time?

1724
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,980
Even if your time's only worth 10 bucks an hour,

1725
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:25,140
which it's not, it's worth it just

1726
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:26,220
with the due diligence feature,

1727
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,500
which is I think my favorite feature about this thing.

1728
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,620
So yes, I think it's like that thing.

1729
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,540
Like if you wanna make professional money,

1730
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:33,820
you treat it professional.

1731
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:37,180
However, if you are just completely broke,

1732
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,580
then obviously you can go and you can hobnob it together.

1733
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:40,420
Yes.

1734
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,900
But again, look at your time and what it's worth.

1735
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,460
And sometimes we just forget about that.

1736
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,820
So 100%.

1737
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:47,220
Quick question, Casey Patton.

1738
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,540
This is actually Kyle's brother.

1739
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:49,380
Good question.

1740
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,200
He says, can you create-

1741
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,040
What's up, Casey?

1742
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:51,880
I know Casey.

1743
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,700
Okay, dope.

1744
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,140
He says, can you create recurring tasks?

1745
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,180
Recurring tasks.

1746
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:59,580
So like you put in a task and you market it complete

1747
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,180
and it comes back up like a month later.

1748
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:03,420
No, we don't have that right now, but that's a great idea.

1749
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:05,700
So when you got it backed up,

1750
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,140
yeah, join the Facebook group,

1751
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:08,380
come to our Facebook group.

1752
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,660
And then when you guys make an account,

1753
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:12,980
you can actually click your little face up here

1754
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,300
and you can click support

1755
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,980
and you can put in a feature request.

1756
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,740
So you just put in your feature request

1757
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:20,140
and it goes straight into the same tool that I use

1758
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:22,460
to work with my developers to build out that kind of thing.

1759
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:25,020
So that's exactly how the flow works

1760
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:26,780
to get that kind of thing added in.

1761
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:30,900
Dustin says, the task tracker reminds me of Trello

1762
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:33,540
with the cam band board.

1763
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,420
Yes, it also like a type drive.

1764
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:38,700
It's so easy to create that card and just drag it over.

1765
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:43,140
Like I used to use Asana and that was like, it was nice,

1766
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:46,060
it was so much that it just overwhelmed me.

1767
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:48,660
This is like a couple of columns, boom, boom, boom.

1768
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,060
You're done.

1769
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,900
Let's see, what else we got?

1770
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,020
Any other questions you see?

1771
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:57,180
Let's answer like one or two more and we'll hop off, dude.

1772
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,420
For sure.

1773
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,580
More info.

1774
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:01,660
So you guys should know this.

1775
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:04,380
Don't sign up on mobile, it's made for desktop.

1776
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:05,780
So if you're trying to sign up on mobile,

1777
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:09,300
it's not gonna take you to a mobile version of this.

1778
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,340
One day maybe we'll have an app or something like that,

1779
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:12,900
but it's designed for desktop.

1780
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:15,100
So I got a question I think about

1781
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,940
signed up on mobile earlier

1782
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,820
and it's just not built for that right now.

1783
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:22,820
So there's really no reason because, dude,

1784
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,860
I don't know about you, I'm not building sites on my mobile.

1785
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:26,020
Like that's just.

1786
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,100
Oh, no one is.

1787
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:27,940
Yeah.

1788
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:29,620
So quick question, Landon says,

1789
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:31,500
what kind of spam filters do you offer?

1790
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,300
And I know there's something out there.

1791
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:38,020
So we've got under your tracking numbers,

1792
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:39,860
we have built-in spam filtering.

1793
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:42,940
You can enable spam filtering

1794
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:46,900
and that requires them to press one to connect the call.

1795
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:48,820
So they'll have a message that says,

1796
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:53,660
thank you for calling, press one to connect.

1797
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:57,420
And the caller will have to actually input that

1798
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:00,180
on their phone to connect the call, right?

1799
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:03,580
So that's the number one thing I've used to reduce spam.

1800
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:05,780
And you can just enable it by clicking with spam filtering

1801
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:07,220
and update your phone number.

1802
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:09,020
Love it.

1803
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:10,620
I like, dude, how simple this is.

1804
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,980
I know that there's other tools that are,

1805
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,540
they have a little bit of overlap.

1806
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:18,300
And the frustrating thing for me was that there was so much

1807
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:21,300
because they're trying to cater to SMMA and SEO agencies

1808
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,140
and all this stuff.

1809
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:25,340
There was so much that like high level just made my,

1810
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:26,860
I started the Twitch.

1811
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:31,500
It's so specific to rank and rent

1812
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,660
that if you aren't in rank and rent,

1813
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:35,820
this stuff wouldn't really make sense,

1814
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:38,380
which I think is the beauty behind it.

1815
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:40,580
Guys, this should show you how confident me and Ryan are

1816
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:41,420
in this fricking industry.

1817
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:43,820
You know, everyone says, how saturated is this?

1818
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:48,820
Well, it's not saturated enough to discourage us from this.

1819
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:51,900
Like this is literally built for rank and rent.

1820
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,740
So let's do one more.

1821
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:57,300
Do we still need a call tracking service

1822
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,140
or does this call take care of that?

1823
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:01,100
Does this tool take care of that?

1824
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,020
Yeah, so all your calls here.

1825
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,100
Excuse me.

1826
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:07,940
What's up?

1827
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:09,780
Can you hear me?

1828
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:10,620
Yeah, I got you.

1829
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:11,620
Okay, keep going, keep going.

1830
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:12,460
My internet went out.

1831
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:13,300
Keep going.

1832
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,980
I was ready to ride into the sunset, man.

1833
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:15,820
I had it.

1834
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:16,660
I had it going.

1835
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:17,500
Sorry, bro.

1836
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,340
Sorry.

1837
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:21,260
I was gonna ride into the sunset.

1838
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:22,100
All right, guys.

1839
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,820
So the question is about call tracker.

1840
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,820
This is all that you need for programmable voice

1841
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:26,660
and messaging.

1842
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:30,180
So if you're in here, you could buy the phone numbers.

1843
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:34,020
You can find a free number of phone numbers

1844
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,140
for your plan, right?

1845
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:39,260
So if you want more than that, you can add phone numbers.

1846
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:40,900
Your phone numbers are free.

1847
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:45,900
And then you set up your right here on the platform, right?

1848
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,980
Where you can listen to call recordings.

1849
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:52,220
You can add notes to the call to go and look at it.

1850
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:54,340
It's like important lead information.

1851
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:55,820
All that's done right in here.

1852
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,780
You don't have to use any third party service

1853
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,820
like CallRail or Twilio or whatever.

1854
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:03,740
Buy numbers in the platform or that you wanna go into

1855
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,580
and set them up.

1856
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:06,420
One thing to note,

1857
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:07,860
because I know this is gonna come up.

1858
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:10,300
You currently, at this version,

1859
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:14,180
you cannot port numbers into this platform yet,

1860
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:16,740
but that is definitely a high priority item.

1861
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:17,580
Shit.

1862
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:18,420
Can you not hear me?

1863
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:21,620
Wow.

1864
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:22,440
That's crazy.

1865
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,280
I think we lost you, Nick.

1866
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,120
Can you hear me now?

1867
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,260
How about now?

1868
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,100
How about now, Ryan?

1869
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:38,740
If you guys have interest in having an API call being made

1870
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:40,380
like Zapier or something like that,

1871
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:43,580
the data is already in the backend normalized.

1872
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:45,540
So it'd be easy to do that eventually,

1873
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:47,580
but we don't have APIs connected in.

1874
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:48,700
Nick, what was your question, man?

1875
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:49,540
Nick, what was your question?

1876
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:50,380
I'm sorry.

1877
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:51,220
I'm sorry.

1878
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,040
I'm sorry.

1879
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:52,880
I'm sorry.

1880
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,700
I'm sorry.

1881
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:54,540
I'm sorry.

1882
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:55,380
I'm sorry.

1883
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,200
I'm sorry.

1884
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,040
I'm sorry.

1885
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:57,880
What was your question, man?

1886
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:58,960
We got your back.

1887
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,800
Sorry.

1888
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,640
We got lucky.

1889
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,560
Apparently, my WiFi's a little bit shoddy here,

1890
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,560
but I was just letting them know

1891
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,440
you cannot port numbers into the software currently,

1892
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,920
but that is something that's a high priority item for us

1893
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,000
to make sure that's implemented,

1894
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,800
but you can buy numbers through the platform.

1895
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,760
Yeah, and you can bring in your own number here.

1896
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,460
You can select a tracking number or you can add one.

1897
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,960
So you can enter your own tracking number right here

1898
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,200
so that if you've got another voice system,

1899
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,040
you've got some numbers on it,

1900
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:26,880
it's no big deal.

1901
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,640
Just come in here, put your number in,

1902
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,640
and it's tied into your site portfolio.

1903
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,700
And there's no issue with that.

1904
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,160
I've got sites that are like that,

1905
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,280
that they aren't ported in yet.

1906
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,600
And we wanna make it to where you guys can port in

1907
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,640
your numbers if you want to,

1908
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,400
to get off whatever old platform that you're on.

1909
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,520
But in the meantime, you can just put those numbers

1910
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,700
right into your site portfolio and tie it up

1911
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:48,160
with whatever site that you're working on.

1912
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:53,160
So would that mean it would still track the leads or no?

1913
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,360
It wouldn't show up as the calls.

1914
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,280
It would just show what phone number is assigned

1915
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,120
to which website right here on the platform,

1916
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,320
even if it's like a third-party service.

1917
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,160
For sure.

1918
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,480
And that is something, guys, we didn't want it.

1919
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,360
Again, it's like, let's just get this thing out.

1920
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,360
Rather than wait super long.

1921
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,120
I was like, Ryan, you should just push this thing out.

1922
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:15,380
So anyway, I think we've gone on long enough.

1923
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,600
All caps Landlord 24.

1924
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:22,080
That's the promo code, 20% off for the first two months.

1925
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,320
Got the community.

1926
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,400
We gave away the swag.

1927
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,440
We've got the AirPod Max winners.

1928
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,800
And I think that is it.

1929
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,160
Ryan Dalton, thanks for being on the call, man.

1930
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,360
Yeah, ARTA Digital Real Estate.

1931
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,560
Great to be on here with you guys.

1932
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,600
Nick, thanks for having me on, man.

1933
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,560
I learned a lot from you.

1934
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:41,280
And I'm always deeply grateful for it.

1935
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,680
Guys, I'm born and raised.

1936
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:45,160
The first group I ever found about this was,

1937
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,840
it used to be called ARTA Pre-Selling.

1938
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,680
And it ain't that anymore.

1939
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,640
It's all grown up.

1940
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:52,120
And so that's how I got started.

1941
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,520
So I found this group.

1942
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,040
And two and a half years later,

1943
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,080
here we are in different life, different world.

1944
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:58,920
I love it, man.

1945
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,040
Well, appreciate you being on.

1946
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,640
And everyone go check out the tool.

1947
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,960
I know for me, my agency,

1948
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,360
it's the only tool that I'm using.

1949
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,840
And it's the only tool that I'm gonna be using

1950
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,680
from here on out.

1951
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,500
So thanks, Ryan.

1952
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,600
See you soon.

1953
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,600
Thanks. See you guys.
