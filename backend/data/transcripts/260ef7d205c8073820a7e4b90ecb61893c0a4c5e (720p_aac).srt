1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,160
All right, hey guys, let's see here.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,000
I think we're live, all right, all right.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,120
Let's see, this lets me go to here, awesome, okay, all right, cool, hey guys, let me put

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:33,120
the link for the zoom here, and then I got to hop on my phone real quick and do the everyone,

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:43,640
so just give me a second, there's the link for the zoom, yeah, let me go here, give me

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:01:11,440
a second, yeah, there we are, yeah, okay, I think we are, yeah, all right, all right,

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:29,760
I think we are, we're there, all right, cool, yeah, okay, cool, all right, what's up guys,

8
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:45,040
how's it going, hope everyone's doing well, yes, let me make sure, sorry, give me a second,

9
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,760
okay, we're good, all right, awesome,

10
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:11,920
let's see, okay, cool, all right, zoom is open, if you guys want to hop in,

11
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:24,800
we can get over and get some ad questions taken care of, and we'll go from there,

12
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:41,360
all right, okay, we got a few people here, are you guys seeing the, for the few people

13
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,720
that are watching, are you seeing the links, sometimes the Facebook interface and the zoom

14
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,360
are really delayed, so I just want to make sure, I see them on my phone, but I'm not necessarily

15
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,680
seeing it on the desktop version, someone can, I think there's only a few people watching,

16
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,600
if you guys can just let me know, that'd be awesome, thank you very much, appreciate that,

17
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:12,800
all right, well, while we're waiting for people, let's go ahead and take a look,

18
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,600
oh, we got someone hopping in, it's like Zach is hopping in, Zach, are you there?

19
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,880
Yeah, I'm here, hey, what's up, man, how you doing? I'm doing pretty good, and you? Good,

20
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,720
oh, not bad, not bad, what can we help you with, do you have any questions for today?

21
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,400
Yeah, I know you guys went over this in like the last few zooms, I think, I don't know if there's,

22
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:42,880
it's with the ranges in the ads and the keyword list, I'm still getting ranges, so, I'm in the

23
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:51,280
US, but I've made an MCC account, and I linked my sub account to it, and on that sub account,

24
00:03:51,280 --> 00:04:01,040
I've ran an ad in the past, and I've spent something like $200 on it, so, yeah, I'm just

25
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,280
wondering how to get that, to not show ranges anymore. Okay, is the ad active right now?

26
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,080
It was active in November, I paused it sometime in December, but I resumed it maybe last week,

27
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,080
a week or two ago. Okay, and when you're under, when you're on Keyword Planner, are you under

28
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:26,320
that account, under that ad account? Yes. Okay, and it's still not showing the ranges for you,

29
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,800
huh? Yeah, like it is showing the ranges, but like not specifically, you know. Okay, would you like

30
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,840
would you be able to share your screen so I can take a look? Yeah, I believe so. I'm kind of getting

31
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,840
the impression that so many more of you guys are having, what group did you come, did you come from

32
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,120
Shib's group, or did you find this group? Yeah, I did. Okay, it seems like everyone from Shib's

33
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:58,640
group is having this issue, so it's very odd, so I'm trying to figure it out as well, but I think

34
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,680
I'm trying to figure it out as well, but I think some of it is,

35
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:14,960
so there's been, I just saw the other day that there's a new, there's some changes in the

36
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,320
interface on Google that's like not showing clicks and impressions as much. I don't think

37
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,120
they're, I don't think it's just a glitch as well, so there's some stuff happening. My point is like

38
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,800
there's stuff happening on the Google ad interface right now, and we're not like fully aware of what

39
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,120
they're trying to do yet. We're all trying to like, what are you guys doing? So, I don't know. So,

40
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,080
okay, yeah, let's try to go to, let's open up Keyword Planner. Let's see what happens here.

41
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:54,400
Okay. Yeah, so this is my sub account I have here. Click it.

42
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:06,400
Concrete.

43
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:17,680
Okay.

44
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,240
Yeah, this is what I've still been getting.

45
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,600
Okay. All right, and this is, did I make seen this right? Ann Arbor,

46
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:42,160
Michigan for the term concrete. All right. Let me, give me, give me a second. Let me,

47
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:51,680
let me pull up mine and let me see. Let me see what I'm getting. Again, I think this is,

48
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:59,200
I don't know if this is like a glitch in the system. I don't know if it's Google trying to

49
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:09,280
like mess with, you know how like they have like the $1,000 spending limit now, and I don't know

50
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,200
if they're doing it. I just, I don't know what they're doing lately. There's definitely some

51
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
interface and platform stuff going on. All right, let me, I'm going to click one here.

52
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,800
Click one here.

53
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,680
Because I think when I had the ad ring in November, I could view it.

54
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:40,080
Yeah. Well, I'm going to see right now. If I'm getting Ann Arbor, Michigan, right?

55
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,760
About 538,000 people. Okay. Concrete. Get results. Let's see what I got here.

56
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:08,480
Getting, not even a spreadsheet showing up. Hang on. Let me hit refresh.

57
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:22,160
That was really weird. It like loaded, but it didn't load all the way. So let me try to redo it.

58
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,960
Give me a second.

59
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:49,760
Hmm. Okay. So I'm getting a really weird, can you scroll up on the spreadsheet on your end there?

60
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,760
Or is that the top? That's the top. Okay. Give me a quick second. Let me see what I got going on here.

61
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,240
There's mine.

62
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:18,240
There it goes.

63
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:36,800
Yeah, mine's showing, don't leave your platform. And let me, I'm just trying to go back and forth

64
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,920
between my window and yours. So mine's showing the term concrete at 110.

65
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:55,040
It has no, it just tracks search volume, but there's no CPC data for it.

66
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,560
Even concrete contractors, concrete companies. There's concrete repair. That's the only one that

67
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:12,160
I have a CPC for. So let's look at this again. That's the same for mine.

68
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,920
That dollar amount. Yeah. But I'm seeing like that's a 20 for me.

69
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,440
Okay.

70
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,440
Okay. Go ahead and scroll up on the spreadsheet.

71
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:17,920
I'm not sure why you're not seeing the same thing. Okay. So I'm running this on

72
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,720
a really, really old smart campaign that Nick used to have that we're not running ads on.

73
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,520
It's still a active campaign, but it's like, there's nothing running on it at all. So it's

74
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,880
like, there's no, it's an active campaign, but the ads are paused. Does that make sense?

75
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,760
So it has the same green like circle you do. When in the keyword planner, I hit concrete,

76
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,240
I hit Ann Arbor. I'm showing this, right? Yours is not showing that.

77
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:55,520
Okay. And then here's the spreadsheet. And this looks like the same thing, like 764 words, right?

78
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,720
Yeah. Yeah. And you can very clearly see that I'm getting concrete concrete.

79
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,320
You can see the exact search volume.

80
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:12,000
So why are you not is the question. And this is in Nick's MCC. And I'm using

81
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,600
one in a whole different state, like system old smart campaign.

82
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,760
So, I mean, there's nothing, that's nothing special about it.

83
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,040
Um, was, was that a campaign that's like already been ran before maybe

84
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,720
this one was, but he, I don't think this campaign has been active for like three years.

85
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,360
Oh yeah. It's still, I mean, there's, it's an active, it's still left,

86
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,480
but there's no active ads running. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure if it was something like

87
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,080
it's grandfathered in compared to this is like a brand new one or what I just set up like

88
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,480
four ads for different clients. Um, this last week, brand new ads, no problem using this.

89
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:07,920
So I'm not sure why, why you guys are having this issue. It's something I haven't figured out why

90
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:15,360
yet, but it's something with, um, the people from it's like something in their setup. I can't figure

91
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:22,320
out what it is yet that you guys are getting from, um, in ships group, like how you guys are setting

92
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:31,440
it up. Um, I'm not sure why yet. Um, again, it could just, it could just be like all of my accounts,

93
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,000
like I've spent well over a thousand dollars, like, um, you know, Nick's like one and a half million.

94
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,600
Uh, I'm, you know, I'm in the several hundred thousand dollar range. Like,

95
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,600
so I don't know if it's just that it could be that and it's like a new platform thing. Um,

96
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:56,800
have you used, um, Ryan's, uh, let me see if I can get to it. Uh, rare rare. Yeah. Have you used that

97
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:07,520
yet? I haven't yet. Okay. Yeah. I highly recommend it. Um, so I'm still like in the beginning of

98
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:14,880
using it, but like, watch, I'm just going to do States. We're going to do

99
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,280
Michigan. We're going to do a few of the videos, uh, yeah. Is that promoting it?

100
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:31,440
Yeah. It's pretty cool. Um, like it's got a lot of the niches built in.

101
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:39,040
Okay. Let's see here. Um, keyword planner and then we're going to do, I totally clicked the wrong

102
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:48,960
one here. Sorry. So let's see what it shows. So this is like, this is kind of where,

103
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,720
like, my brain is at right now with this for you guys. Um, let me, let me share my screen again.

104
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:03,200
Okay. So, okay. So I just went in, I just did concrete, Michigan, Ann Arbor, right? And it's

105
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:09,360
like, here's your, that's a good one. Um, and then we're going to, we're going to, we're going to

106
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay. So, okay. So I just went in, I just did concrete, Michigan, Ann Arbor,

107
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,400
right? And it's like, here's your, that's exactly what I saw on keyword planner.

108
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,280
Um, it doesn't give a CPC, but you see this, how there's like, this is your, are you familiar with

109
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:34,720
like keyword difficulty, a KD rating? Um, not a whole lot. Okay. It's just, it's just a,

110
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,400
some of the platforms use it as a metric to try to tell you like very easy, medium,

111
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,720
or super difficult keyword to rank for. Um, and when you see this PPC thing here with a number,

112
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,680
it's very similar to that. It's basically, they're just doing a quick, like it's, it's right here.

113
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,280
It's low, medium, or like really high competition, right? So this tells me that there might be some

114
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,600
ads running, but it may not be enough for it to like really pick up the other data that you're

115
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:12,400
wanting to find. Okay. Um, but then like, you can see, you know, it kind of, I just did one word

116
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,840
and it populates a lot of these other ones, right? So it's like concrete companies, concrete

117
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,600
contracts. So there's search volume here. Um, you know, I only see like, remember we saw the

118
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,400
concrete repair was the only one that we saw that for. Um, so it's definitely something to

119
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:39,920
see what this is. It's, it's, uh, look at this. Um, yeah, you can see like in the warmer months,

120
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,960
there's more searches than the colder months. Um, and that might be why it's not picking up CPC

121
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:51,280
right now. That could be why, because it is cold up there. Um, so my, my thing right now for you

122
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:58,880
guys is like this, this tool allows you to do like track tasks. You could do due diligence on it.

123
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,040
Um, you can, you know, put things in, you can keep track of things in your clients, like leads,

124
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,360
phone numbers, like it's a pretty bitching tool. Um, I haven't messed with the backlink analyzer

125
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,800
yet because that's still new, but, um, I think this is like the path forward for you guys.

126
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:24,480
Honestly, it just, it just, it seems to simplify things. It's less spreadsheets. It's less manual

127
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,680
stuff. It kind of is like a one-stop shop for what we want to do. And it allows you to go really

128
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:38,320
fast and at scale. So, um, I'm still trying to figure out how to get my VA on it. Um,

129
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,160
and, and maybe get her off of like using main goals and SIM rush and all that stuff. So I

130
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,920
may have her go full time on rare just to see if it's faster for her to do so.

131
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,360
And when it doesn't get like CPCs that pick up on that, is that like a

132
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,280
keyword you should not be like targeting as well?

133
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,720
Uh, so yes and no. Like if you're looking at Michigan, like you saw in one of those,

134
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,840
like it dropped off to like 10 in the cold months and you can see it pick back up in the warmer

135
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:19,760
months. So that, that doesn't mean that there's no ads running. It just probably means there's

136
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,760
not a lot of ads running right now. Sometimes when like search volumes really low, it doesn't,

137
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,640
it just doesn't aggregate the data up. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't run an ad on it.

138
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,720
Or if you go like to a warmer city and try to maybe use that term, you might get better results

139
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,360
right now. Like if you go somewhere in Florida right now, um, you may see more, like even a

140
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,520
like-sized city. I mean, that's a, that was like what 538,000 people. Um, that's one of those,

141
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,120
like if you go back way back in the group, you'll see people like I did my research and CPC was this

142
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,280
and three months later it's like this. And it's like, well, yeah, it's warmer. There's more people

143
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,240
on the auction market. Like, so, you know, there's, there's, there are fluctuations in the data.

144
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,480
There's fluctuations in the marketplace, right? But, uh, like right now searching in a cold place

145
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,680
for concrete may not give you the best results because sometimes that data that Google is

146
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,880
giving to you is like within a couple of like, it might only be two or three months of data

147
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:32,320
and may not be like forever data. Right. So, and you'll see that like, you'll see that in like,

148
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,880
let's say you're, you're running ads at say, like, say you start and it's like 650 click.

149
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,720
And then in the warmer months, it's like double that. And then you'll notice again, in the colder

150
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,960
months, it goes back down. So if you stay in certain niches in certain areas, you'll see kind

151
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,920
of cycles, but it's just the thing where, you know, it's why we, you know, we, that's why we

152
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,040
want to look at our ads and make adjustments and we go through them and we look at things and,

153
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,240
oh, what is, what is my, what is it telling me this bit is versus what is my set limit at? And

154
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,240
sometimes you have to fluctuate with that, uh, depending on the weather, really.

155
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,760
So that makes sense. I appreciate your help.

156
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,400
Yeah, no problem. But yeah, I think I'm not sure why you guys, it's, it seems like, I don't know

157
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,880
if we're getting all of our new students from shifts group, but all of you guys are having the

158
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,560
same problems. I'm not sure if it's like, maybe you set up Google ads or your Google keyword planner

159
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,760
a certain way, and it's not recognizing that ad, but I've had other students where we did that

160
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,080
and it worked fine for them. So it's just not working out for everybody. But I'm also,

161
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,560
I'm not like a hundred percent there, but like I mentioned, I'm seeing stuff on the interface

162
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:50,640
that is like not showing data the way it normally would. And it's like, you have to like go and like

163
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,600
manually open columns. And so there's something going on with the Google ads platform is what

164
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm getting at. So I don't know if they're like silently doing an update. I don't know if they're

165
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,760
doing some backend stuff. And so our user end is not looking correct right now. I don't know if

166
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,880
this is going to be a permanent thing, if it's a temporary thing yet, but I'm kind of, I'm kind of

167
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:21,040
going towards, because right, like Google, like, okay, Google is the largest advertising agency,

168
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,560
like in the world. Okay. So they want to make money. They've been losing money for years. So

169
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:33,360
they're doing things to try to make more money, but their biggest, the biggest thing they kind

170
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:41,920
of like guard against is fraud. Right. And so, so like one of the, like one of the barriers to entry

171
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,080
now is like, you have to spend a thousand dollars in ad spend to be able to like quote unquote,

172
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,240
like run an MCC or be able to set up sub accounts in your MCC. That's something that's about a year

173
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:59,360
old now. It was like, now, like now everybody faces that, or for like the first five or six

174
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,120
months of that, it was hit and miss. Now it's like, that's just, that's, that's how it is for

175
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,240
everybody on the platform. So my point is like, they change things sometimes, and sometimes

176
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:18,560
they'll do certain things for certain features to make the barrier enter it harder or higher.

177
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:27,200
And part of that is like, because if, if I have you run ads for a range, if I'm Google,

178
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,800
and then I wanted to get you on a call with one of my people, my salespeople,

179
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,520
who I call a Google expert, they're just trying to, they're going to want to set up your ad for you

180
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,360
and run it for you. They're just going to spend all your money and they don't really care that you

181
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,480
make money on it. Right. They're just want to get your money. So that there could be something like

182
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,800
that happening on the Google ad platform. I'm not sure yet, but I'm thinking that this,

183
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,640
we may be seeing that. So we'll have to change how we like kind of do our setup. And so thankfully

184
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:05,280
for us right now, rare is available and it's working really well. And I've ran, I've ran dozens

185
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:14,800
of like, look at rare data and look at keyword planner data. And it is almost always spot on.

186
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,160
Sometimes one of the search terms is like 10 or 20 off, but that's more just because like

187
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:31,440
the API that he's using to pull that data in is probably a month older than what like actual

188
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,560
keyword planner data is. So you might have a month where like search volume increases,

189
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,240
but it like, it hasn't caught up to the API feed that he gets his data from.

190
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,840
So that, but that gets a small discrepancy. And when I've seen it, I can look at it and go,

191
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,600
oh, I know why I can see it. I can see the data difference. And then if I, I'm sure if I go back

192
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,760
and check it, his will get updated the next month. So I think it's just like a little

193
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:04,320
month delay reporting, but it's, it's been super accurate as far as like for our needs,

194
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,080
as far as that. So I think that that's like the place to, to start doing this stuff out for you

195
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:17,040
guys. Pretty spot on. Yeah. Yeah. It's been great. I mean, I'm, like I said, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to,

196
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:24,160
I'm trying to like build a process and then, and build like a kind of like a training video and

197
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,560
like a, like a, like a step-by-step thing. Cause my VA knows main goals really well.

198
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:36,160
And she, she knows keyword planner. She knows how to like double check with keyword planner when she

199
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:44,640
has a maybe. But, you know, using how I, how I've been doing due to her, I've had her doing

200
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:51,360
due diligence using that and rare has been giving me the same info and it's all in one place. So we

201
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,000
don't have to like have multiple tabs, multiple sheets. It takes away a lot of like a lot of time.

202
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,560
Like that's why I have a VA doing it for me now, because it's worth it for me to have them do it.

203
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,960
So I'm not bogged down for hours doing due diligence, but with rare, like if I was just,

204
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,240
you know, by myself, I would rather use that tool because it does all of the stuff for me in one

205
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:22,160
place. Whereas, you know, how I have it done now, it's like, it's multiple steps on different

206
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:28,720
software and then we put it into place. So anyways, I'm trying to kind of streamline my

207
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,280
thing so I can now train her how to use it. So that it kind of makes me, it makes sense to her,

208
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,760
but I'd probably get that done like later this weekend or something. So.

209
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:47,120
Yeah, that makes sense. I wonder why the ads accounts like that, because I had a Google

210
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,040
Keyword Planner through Shiv's group and then it got it suspended. So I made a new,

211
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,120
I used a new Gmail for this one and it's still not working for this. So yeah, it's pretty confusing.

212
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,600
Yeah. Yeah. It's just what it is. I don't know. It's just Google being Google. I wish I could

213
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:17,040
tell you it was something easy, but like I said, Ryan's thing has done pretty awesome.

214
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,200
And I think that's where you guys should like probably go to.

215
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,000
Okay. Well, I appreciate your help, Jay.

216
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,760
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I couldn't solve it anymore, but like I said, I think that's the

217
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,280
issue there. So. Yeah, no problem. I think so.

218
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,600
All right, man. Cool. All right. Take care, man.

219
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,440
Yeah. I'll see you. All right. See you.

220
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,840
All right. Okay. It's just me again. I think we have a few people watching.

221
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,960
Anyone wants to hop in? The Zoom link is there.

222
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:04,800
For some reason, the chat on my desktop is not caught up on the Facebook. So give me a second.

223
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:13,680
Okay. I'm going to see if I can like send this to see if this helps like pop it through.

224
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,000
Oh, I see why it's doing it.

225
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,680
Okay. All right.

226
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,160
Let's see if I can go here.

227
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,240
Okay. All right. I am seeing it on my other window. So, okay. We'll just kind of go with that.

228
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,960
So if you guys have any other questions, let me know if you guys want. We have the Zoom open.

229
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,840
I'll kind of leave the Zoom open. And if you guys don't have any questions,

230
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:54,160
I will start running through some of the DMs I got this week and we can go from there.

231
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:16,720
Okay. And just like a thing for everyone that's new and listening or seeing the replay of this,

232
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,120
I try to be very, I try to check into the Fix It paid ads account at least twice a day.

233
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:30,080
I'm pretty consistent with that, just so you know. But like if you guys leave me a DM

234
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:40,880
and I don't respond and say like, try to give me 36 hours-ish, if you don't hear back from me,

235
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,880
don't be afraid to like just get on the DM and say, hey man, just wanted to see if you got this yet.

236
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:54,880
So, and I just say that because like sometimes, like say I've got my full-time job and

237
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,760
things are getting busy. Like I may see your question and I recognize your question and I'm

238
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,240
like, well, that's going to take like, you know, that's going to take like, I need to spend some

239
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,880
time. That's not a quick answer. Basically, it's not something, oh, do this or do that. It might

240
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,320
be something where I have to kind of like go sit, think about it, or maybe pull up some info for you

241
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,520
to share with you or try to go find something in the group or something to share with you.

242
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,720
So sometimes like that may happen and it's just, I get distracted or busy. It's not that I'm

243
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:31,040
forgetful. I just got busy and forgot to get back to you. So just don't be afraid to send back. But

244
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:37,600
I'm pretty good about trying to get right back to you guys when I can. But I just want you guys to

245
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,080
know that. And at the same time, if you leave me something and I reply back to you, like,

246
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,200
and you don't reply back for like two weeks, don't, when you come back in two weeks looking

247
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:57,920
for something, don't expect me to jump on and get things going. So let's see. Okay.

248
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,280
Okay. He got that. That was just access issue.

249
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:23,600
Let's see. Oh, just, hey, I get things like this. Just so you guys know, like people call,

250
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,280
like your people will send me messages and say, like, I'm getting phone calls for my ad,

251
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:35,040
but there it sounds scammy or people are saying that they've called someone else or it's whatever,

252
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:40,800
like, just know that like we all deal with that. There's like, you know, there's captcha that you

253
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:50,640
can do for like to try to reduce like the form span. There's, you know, you can do like the IVR

254
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,720
with like press one or press two to talk to somebody. And that helps like reduce some spam,

255
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:04,880
but like the sophistication of spam is like, they're always like steps ahead of like the

256
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,920
defense mechanism. So just, just understand that like we all deal with that. And so just,

257
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,080
just kind of take that for what it is. Like, just, just know that like, you're not the only

258
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:22,160
one going through stuff when that happens. Okay. All right. And anybody that's watching,

259
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,920
if you guys want to hop on to the Zoom, the Zoom link is in the comments. If you have any questions

260
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:36,800
you want to go over, we can go over your stuff. Let's see here. And then, you know, I don't know

261
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,480
how many times we've got to repeat this, like, stay out of large cities. Like, just don't do it.

262
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:50,640
Please don't do it. Once you get like experience and you are very confident and you're making money,

263
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:59,440
you know, then there's ways to like eke into it and niche down and, you know, get better with

264
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,800
your locations and ad groups. And you have to set up multiple location pages and service pages.

265
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,680
Like there's ways to do it, but like, don't jump into it. Don't like, like don't jump into Houston.

266
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,720
You know, like don't, that's, that's not, you're just going to, until you have the experience to

267
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,920
do it, like, you're just going to piss away thousands of dollars. And if you think you're

268
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:29,280
going to hop into a big Metro market for $5 a day or $5 a click at $20 a day, like you're not going

269
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,880
to make any money. You're not going to have any business owners that are going to be happy with

270
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,480
you. So just take our advice and don't do that, right? Small, smaller cities, like keep it

271
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,000
manageable. Well, once you get experience and you understand this stuff and you can read the data,

272
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:51,040
that's when you can maybe start doing those bigger city areas. Okay. Some of you guys,

273
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,720
really just a couple of you, like, it seems like every, every couple of weeks I get a message and

274
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,640
you're trying to find a place and it's a constant like, well, don't, don't do that. Okay.

275
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:17,040
Let's see. Todd, Todd hit me up. Yeah. Todd, if you're here, let me know. I know you had some

276
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:27,840
questions. Let's see here. Let's see. Is anybody on the zoom? No. Okay. Let's see. We got,

277
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:42,720
okay. Sarah. Oh yeah. We, we got Sarah square away last week. Okay.

278
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,560
This is something you get this recommendation on and other training. You get this recommendation

279
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:00,720
from Google is like conversion tracking. Um, on your Weebly one-pagers, to me, there's really no

280
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,280
reason to do it at all. Um, if you set up a full webpage, a full website, and you want to put it

281
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:15,760
on certain triggers, you can do that. Um, I personally don't think it's worth a big hassle

282
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:24,880
to do it. Um, the value I see in it is if I'm setting up ads for like someone else's website,

283
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:34,000
then I might spend time to do it so that it kind of like, you know, uh, how I use it as a way to

284
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,360
kind of like, quote unquote, like show value to them. Um, at the end of the day though, like, um,

285
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:51,120
like, like my client's phones are ringing and they're getting forms or they're not like, I don't

286
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:57,840
really care about the conversion stuff unless I'm into some very competitive markets or like high

287
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:03,600
population areas. I don't really care. I just want the phone ring and I want forms to come in. So,

288
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:12,960
um, you know, if, if I am doing stuff in like LA and Orange County, um, I got a guy in our land,

289
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,720
I got a couple of people in Orlando right now. Uh, I have somebody in Miami for them. I have,

290
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,720
and it's just, it's for me, um, it's, I'm using it in a way to like,

291
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:32,720
um, focus on areas that we're getting wins at and then not, um, and then kind of like

292
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,040
be able to like shut down stuff where we're not getting wins at, if that makes sense. So

293
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,320
it's just one of those things. Um,

294
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,760
yeah, somebody wants to buy my leads from me in the group. I understand, but all right.

295
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,080
Okay. Yep. That's caught up. I think there are some more pretty simple stuff.

296
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:06,080
So, uh, with that, I'm going to hit refresh here, see if there's anything new. Sorry. Um,

297
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,840
okay. Let me see. There's any new comments. I don't see any. Cool. Does anybody have any other

298
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,640
questions or anything? The zoom is open. I'll leave it open for a couple more minutes. Uh,

299
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,400
it looks like there's just a few of you here watching. I don't know who's watching, but

300
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:27,360
if you guys got any questions, type them in the comments, um, or, uh, hop on the zoom and then,

301
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:41,920
um, yeah, let's see here. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. Cool.

302
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,320
All right guys. Uh, so I guess they're in short and sweet today. Not a lot of people on all good.

303
00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:01,440
For those that are having issues with your Google, um, keyword planner stuff, I highly,

304
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,960
highly, highly recommend that you guys get the rare software from Ryan Dalton. You can reach

305
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,560
out to him directly. I believe there's a discount for digital landlord members right now. I thought

306
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:19,440
I caught that on Nick's live, I believe, or a post that he did. Um, anyways, we'll just hit

307
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,760
up Ryan. He'll help you out, get you set up there. Um, I've been using it. Um, you know,

308
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,520
I'll start like we just showed earlier with Zach. Um, it's been working really good. So anyhow,

309
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,840
all right guys, uh, let me check zoom one more time. I don't see anybody here. Cool. All right.

310
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:41,280
You guys have a great one. Uh, take care. You know, if you guys have any questions later, bye.
