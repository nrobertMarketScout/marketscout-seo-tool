00:00.000 --> 00:15.960
Alright guys, let's talk about the one pager, what we need to absolutely include.

00:15.960 --> 00:22.240
I'm gonna call this the 1.2 million dollar template and the reason why is because I have

00:22.240 --> 00:26.920
literally spent that much money on Google at the time of recording this and by doing

00:26.920 --> 00:29.960
that, I've been able to test a lot of things on landing pages.

00:29.960 --> 00:33.880
I've been able to test if the picture should go here, if the website or if the quote form

00:33.880 --> 00:39.560
should go right there, what questions we should ask, how big should the phone number be, where

00:39.560 --> 00:40.560
should we put this.

00:40.560 --> 00:45.080
I've tested all that stuff over the course of 1.2 million dollars and I'm going to show

00:45.080 --> 00:50.360
you the template that if you can replicate this, you are going to be fine.

00:50.360 --> 00:54.400
You can add your own little flavors, but I'm gonna go over some of the non-negotiables

00:54.400 --> 00:58.080
that you must include on this one page template.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.800
Again, this is something you have to do right once, so take your time, just like the keyword

01:01.800 --> 01:02.800
list.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.240
Do the keyword list correctly.

01:04.240 --> 01:07.320
Do the one pager well the first time and guess what?

01:07.320 --> 01:11.360
Next time, you just copy and paste, you swap out the, hey, instead of concrete, it's tree

01:11.360 --> 01:12.360
surface.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.360
Instead of tree surface, it's this, okay?

01:13.360 --> 01:16.480
You swap out the phone number, maybe you swap out the colors, swap out the pictures and

01:16.480 --> 01:18.200
the content, done, done and done.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.320
Okay, so take your time and make this really, really good.

01:21.480 --> 01:27.520
All right, guys, so here you can see a quick example of what I would consider a perfect

01:27.520 --> 01:28.520
landing page.

01:28.520 --> 01:31.760
I know some of you guys that are coming from WordPress backgrounds or you have the design

01:31.760 --> 01:34.640
out, you're like, oh my gosh, this?

01:34.640 --> 01:35.640
Like this right here?

01:35.640 --> 01:36.640
Yes, this, okay?

01:36.640 --> 01:39.160
Let me tell you about this, okay?

01:39.160 --> 01:42.440
You're looking at albuquerqueconcrete.weebly.com.

01:42.440 --> 01:50.820
I built this, actually I didn't, my team built this website a year and two months ago, okay?

01:50.820 --> 01:55.100
We did our regular process that we teach in here, we ran ads, we went and found a business

01:55.100 --> 01:58.020
owner, we closed the deal, awesome, okay?

01:58.020 --> 02:05.420
And something happened and that is I forgot to follow up and have my project manager build

02:05.420 --> 02:06.420
the actual website.

02:06.420 --> 02:09.060
We got the deal and we forgot to build the website, okay?

02:09.060 --> 02:15.700
So about, oh, was it about a month and a half ago, I reached out to Francesca and I said,

02:15.700 --> 02:18.540
Francesca, give me a rankings report on these cities, okay?

02:18.780 --> 02:22.460
And so she went through and one of the cities was albuquerqueconcrete.

02:22.460 --> 02:26.660
So I was looking at the rankings report and I said, oh, where's the rankings for that

02:26.660 --> 02:27.660
one?

02:27.660 --> 02:29.660
Because I was just looking at that client.

02:29.660 --> 02:32.940
And she said, yeah, I was gonna tell you about that, she's like, we don't have a website

02:32.940 --> 02:33.940
for that one.

02:33.940 --> 02:35.380
I'm like, what do you mean we don't have a website for that one?

02:35.380 --> 02:37.460
She's like, yeah, we don't have a website for that one.

02:37.460 --> 02:41.340
We've been running ads to the one pager for a year.

02:41.340 --> 02:44.620
So guys, I had done the deal at whatever, let's call it a thousand bucks, I can't remember

02:44.620 --> 02:46.540
the exact specifics on that deal, a thousand bucks.

02:46.540 --> 02:49.900
I was spending 500, and in this case, I think it was even less.

02:49.900 --> 02:56.180
And I was making the difference, 500 to 700 dollars of profit the entire time, even though

02:56.180 --> 02:57.180
I didn't have a website.

02:57.180 --> 03:00.300
I just set up the ads and I was pushing the leads and I had the credit card involved and

03:00.300 --> 03:02.060
I was arbitraging this thing.

03:02.060 --> 03:04.380
So I know this doesn't look great.

03:04.380 --> 03:07.740
I know it's like, this is very basic.

03:07.740 --> 03:09.860
I know, I know, I know, but guess what?

03:09.860 --> 03:10.860
It works.

03:10.860 --> 03:13.460
It works, it works, it works, and it will produce leads.

03:13.460 --> 03:17.440
So let's take a look at some of the things you have to include, okay?

03:17.440 --> 03:21.980
Number one, I'm just gonna show you, and you guys are free to go build your one pager on

03:21.980 --> 03:27.980
Wix, Wordpress, I don't care, it doesn't actually matter.

03:27.980 --> 03:32.260
And I'm not gonna spend time going in and showing you how to use a web builder, because

03:32.260 --> 03:33.260
guys, it's not hard.

03:33.260 --> 03:39.540
You literally go and drag stuff over, like you drag a picture over, you drag the content

03:39.540 --> 03:40.540
down.

03:40.540 --> 03:41.540
It's not difficult, okay?

03:41.620 --> 03:45.140
Couple things I'm gonna show you, and these are like non-negotiable.

03:45.140 --> 03:46.980
So number one is the phone number.

03:46.980 --> 03:49.660
The phone number needs to be the centerpiece of this website.

03:49.660 --> 03:55.460
So as you can see here on the screen, it is the centerpiece, it's the thing that pops,

03:55.460 --> 03:58.020
and honestly, I think it could be even a little bit bigger.

03:58.020 --> 04:02.780
Do not, and I understand, most websites, they have the big writing, it says Albuquerque

04:02.780 --> 04:04.900
Concrete, like this big, right?

04:04.900 --> 04:08.100
And then the phone number is this little teeny thing, probably not even underneath, it's

04:08.100 --> 04:10.660
up in the corner, because it looks sleek, okay?

04:10.780 --> 04:14.100
And guess what, I don't care about sleek, I care about freaking making money, and in

04:14.100 --> 04:16.180
order to make money, phone needs to rain, okay?

04:16.180 --> 04:19.540
So what I'm gonna do is, you need to start thinking about the customer.

04:19.540 --> 04:23.500
If you have a customer looking for concrete, quit making it difficult for them to call

04:23.500 --> 04:24.500
you.

04:24.500 --> 04:27.380
Quit making it difficult for them to get ahold of you, to ask for an estimate.

04:27.380 --> 04:31.840
So everything that you do, the psychology here is, how do we make this as easy as possible

04:31.840 --> 04:36.500
for somebody looking for concrete to call us, and therefore grabbing that lead?

04:36.500 --> 04:41.660
And one of the things is, making that phone number right there in their face, and the

04:41.660 --> 04:45.500
last thing I want to point out on this phone number, is it's a click to call.

04:45.500 --> 04:50.940
Meaning, I highlighted it, and I did a call, an action button, which means if they click

04:50.940 --> 04:54.940
on it, it's immediately going to call directly to the phone number, which is the tracking

04:54.940 --> 04:57.220
number, which goes to the business owner.

04:57.220 --> 05:00.580
And the best thing to do there is, I like to, so link it up, make sure it's click to

05:00.580 --> 05:04.140
call, and I like to add an underline.

05:04.180 --> 05:08.260
A lot of times on these web builders, when you make it click to call, it adds the underline.

05:08.260 --> 05:13.380
I am going to tell you right now, go and manually add the underline, because it just triggers

05:13.380 --> 05:16.740
in people's brain, oh, I can click on that, it's a link, it's a phone number.

05:16.740 --> 05:19.260
So that is a click to call, you can see.

05:19.260 --> 05:20.260
So add that.

05:20.260 --> 05:25.500
You honestly, I just include this somewhere on the screen, not as important as the phone

05:25.500 --> 05:26.500
number.

05:26.500 --> 05:31.020
Phone number, that's the number one non-negotiable, needs to be big, bold, center, and it needs

05:31.020 --> 05:32.700
to be click to call.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.900
Next thing is this quote form.

05:35.900 --> 05:39.940
And there's a right way to do this, and there's a wrong way to do this.

05:39.940 --> 05:44.380
One thing that I think helps a lot is with the quote form making it pop.

05:44.380 --> 05:48.540
And one thing that I've found to make it pop is to make it have a background.

05:48.540 --> 05:52.900
Okay, so you can see right here, this isn't just like a quote form that says free instant

05:52.900 --> 05:54.740
quote and it's kind of tucked in the corner, right?

05:54.740 --> 05:55.740
It's not.

05:55.740 --> 06:01.180
It is, it's got a background, it just kind of pops against that white.

06:01.180 --> 06:03.420
So I would encourage you to do the same, okay?

06:03.420 --> 06:09.740
And another couple things about this quote form is make it seem as if when they fill

06:09.740 --> 06:15.340
this out, they put in their information, they put in what concrete surface they need, the

06:15.340 --> 06:21.100
square footage, all that, make it almost seem like as soon as they push get my quote, they're

06:21.100 --> 06:24.900
gonna get an immediate email.

06:24.900 --> 06:29.220
I want it to seem almost like you're gonna open up your email or your text message and

06:29.220 --> 06:31.140
you're gonna have a quote, okay?

06:31.140 --> 06:32.540
That's the psychology behind it.

06:32.540 --> 06:36.500
And guys, we are going to get them an immediate quote because we're gonna call them immediately

06:36.500 --> 06:38.940
or the business owner's gonna call them immediately, okay?

06:38.940 --> 06:41.820
So on the instant quote, make sure it pops.

06:41.820 --> 06:46.940
I like to add the free instant quote, free instant estimate, whatever.

06:46.940 --> 06:51.060
I like to make sure the word instant is in there because I want people thinking, hey,

06:51.060 --> 06:53.820
I can get price quick because they're gonna get price quick, we're gonna call them.

06:53.820 --> 06:58.180
I like to throw a little exclamation point.

06:58.180 --> 07:02.100
You can experiment around with this plus free bonus coupon thing.

07:02.100 --> 07:05.700
I don't even think that's necessary and some people are gonna watch this go, what's the

07:05.700 --> 07:07.100
bonus coupon?

07:07.100 --> 07:10.260
Honestly, I don't even think it's necessary.

07:10.260 --> 07:11.740
So that doesn't matter, okay?

07:11.740 --> 07:12.740
You can include it if you want.

07:12.740 --> 07:16.340
Okay, guys, so there's a few things with this quote form that need to be done right and

07:16.340 --> 07:21.020
you're probably like, I never thought that this much thought went into the quote form.

07:21.020 --> 07:22.860
This much thought goes into the quote form, okay?

07:22.860 --> 07:24.700
So I wanna show you what most people do.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.860
So I just went ahead and I typed in Albuquerque concrete.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.700
I looked at the first person ranking, okay?

07:28.700 --> 07:31.260
It's this company called Duke City, whatever.

07:31.260 --> 07:33.340
Now this is more like a ready mix, whatever.

07:33.340 --> 07:37.020
So I know it's not necessarily the exact same thing but I just wanna prove a point without

07:37.020 --> 07:38.620
spending a ton of time.

07:38.620 --> 07:42.660
If you look, first of all, their quote forms are nowhere to be found, okay?

07:42.660 --> 07:46.780
They're definitely not in that first like fold where you're like, oh, there's the quote

07:46.780 --> 07:49.580
form, let me get a quote.

07:49.580 --> 07:52.700
And side note, good luck finding the phone number.

07:52.700 --> 07:56.660
I don't even see a phone number on here so we're gonna win based on that.

07:56.660 --> 07:59.380
If I wanted to contact these guys, I have to work.

07:59.380 --> 08:01.700
I don't want to make the customer work, okay?

08:01.700 --> 08:08.100
So if you scroll all the way to the bottom, this is what most people do, is contact us,

08:08.100 --> 08:09.260
okay?

08:09.260 --> 08:14.100
Contact us to me as a customer, literally screams, hey, solicit me.

08:14.100 --> 08:15.700
Call me and bug me, okay?

08:15.700 --> 08:21.940
You enter your name, your email, your subject, like that just means they literally put a,

08:21.940 --> 08:23.740
that just means they put no thought into this.

08:23.740 --> 08:26.100
Your subject, what do you mean your subject, right?

08:26.100 --> 08:29.800
And then your message, this is the dumbest thing ever, then it says submit.

08:29.800 --> 08:33.460
This is such a standard BS crap, if you guys do this, I see this, I'm gonna be pissed.

08:33.460 --> 08:34.460
Do not do this.

08:34.460 --> 08:39.800
Contrast that, which is what 99% of people do, oh, good job by the way, Duke, find your

08:39.800 --> 08:43.360
number at the bottom, not click to call, so now I have to go, I have to write it down

08:43.360 --> 08:44.360
and then put it in.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.340
Not a good strategy, but that's a side note, okay?

08:46.340 --> 08:48.780
Go back to this.

08:48.780 --> 08:50.380
Contrast what you just saw with this one.

08:50.380 --> 08:53.820
You look at the bottom, you're looking at the screen, you're like, oh, free instant

08:53.820 --> 08:55.980
quote, okay?

08:56.860 --> 09:00.340
Here's the kicker, instead of just hitting them and saying, hey, free instant quote,

09:00.340 --> 09:04.180
give me your name, your phone number, your email, your address, your this, your that,

09:04.180 --> 09:07.900
your social security number, okay, don't do that, okay?

09:07.900 --> 09:12.820
What you need to do is psychologically, we wanna get them down the rabbit hole a little

09:12.820 --> 09:13.820
bit.

09:13.820 --> 09:17.380
So, the first thing they see is instead of saying, hey, give me your name, we're asking

09:17.380 --> 09:18.380
them a question.

09:18.380 --> 09:21.780
We're saying, what concrete service do you need?

09:22.020 --> 09:27.860
And they can look and go driveway, sidewalk, walkway, patio, okay, well, we were just looking

09:27.860 --> 09:32.300
at, oh, or other, okay, okay, so I'm gonna choose sidewalk.

09:32.300 --> 09:37.380
Approximate size, square footage of project, right, and they're like, I don't really know,

09:37.380 --> 09:40.420
but look, probably more than 100, okay?

09:40.420 --> 09:42.300
Now think about it like this.

09:42.300 --> 09:49.460
The customer's already answered two questions, it says instant, and now we're like, oh, by

09:49.460 --> 09:53.340
the way, give us your name and your phone number and your email, and it says, get my

09:53.340 --> 09:55.160
quote.

09:55.160 --> 10:01.500
This right here is a completely different and psychologically just, it's on point because

10:01.500 --> 10:04.960
we're getting them, and think about it if you're a human, you're like, oh, I've already

10:04.960 --> 10:09.300
answered two of the questions, I may as well just drop in my name and email and get a quote

10:09.300 --> 10:12.140
in the chance that they're gonna just email it to me, right?

10:12.140 --> 10:13.580
They might just email it to me.

10:13.580 --> 10:18.500
So guys, the keys here to look at with this quote is make it pop, okay?

10:18.540 --> 10:24.180
Make sure you ask one to two questions related to that service that almost make it seem like

10:24.180 --> 10:28.860
they're gonna get an instant quote in the form of an email, okay?

10:28.860 --> 10:31.900
Even though they are gonna get an instant quote in the form of a phone call, you almost

10:31.900 --> 10:33.980
want it to be like it's an auto-generated thing, okay?

10:33.980 --> 10:39.840
So ask two questions and then ask for, at the very most, name, phone number, email.

10:39.840 --> 10:43.860
Now I know some people and some business owners are gonna go, hey, can you just get the addresses?

10:43.860 --> 10:44.860
Can you get this?

10:44.860 --> 10:45.860
Can you get that?

10:45.860 --> 10:47.780
Guys, there's a fine line.

10:47.780 --> 10:51.340
You ask too many questions here, people aren't, they're gonna be discouraged.

10:51.340 --> 10:54.580
But when it's the name, phone number, email, things that they literally have memorized

10:54.580 --> 10:59.340
and it's very simple and easy, they're willing to give it after they've answered a couple

10:59.340 --> 11:00.340
questions.

11:00.340 --> 11:04.740
I'm telling you right now, I've tested flipping this and asking for the name, phone number,

11:04.740 --> 11:06.340
email, and then the questions.

11:06.340 --> 11:10.940
I get way better conversion out of this where we ask one, two questions, okay?

11:10.940 --> 11:16.500
And then we go name, phone number, email, boom, get my quote.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.460
Guys, that is the one-pagers.

11:18.460 --> 11:22.820
These are the things that are non-negotiables that have to be included and that is a bold

11:22.820 --> 11:27.220
centered phone number that needs to be underlined, it needs to be clicked to call, okay?

11:27.220 --> 11:30.140
It needs to be the centerpiece of your website.

11:30.140 --> 11:33.340
By the way, at this stage, if you would like to use your cell phone, you can use your cell

11:33.340 --> 11:34.340
phone.

11:34.340 --> 11:39.540
However, I would recommend using a call tracking service so that it's, first of all, not your

11:39.540 --> 11:40.540
phone number.

11:40.540 --> 11:42.480
Second of all, you know that it came from that website.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.420
Have you ever gotten your phone out and you missed calls and you're like, man, I wonder

11:45.540 --> 11:49.980
if they called me from my company website, they called me from this, call me from that.

11:49.980 --> 11:53.220
You don't even know, especially if you have multiple sites feeding into that phone number,

11:53.220 --> 11:56.940
that's gonna get really tricky really quick because when you call, when they call, you're

11:56.940 --> 11:58.300
not gonna know who it is, okay?

11:58.300 --> 12:03.100
So I do recommend using a call tracking service, but it's not necessary if this is your first

12:03.100 --> 12:04.820
project and you're on a thin budget.

12:04.820 --> 12:05.820
I get it.

12:05.820 --> 12:07.580
So make sure that's there.

12:07.580 --> 12:10.860
And then the quote form, and not only the quote form, make sure it pops.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.980
Make sure you ask at least two questions.

12:12.980 --> 12:16.900
So for example, if it was masonry, it could say, you know, you could say, what service

12:16.900 --> 12:18.020
do you need?

12:18.020 --> 12:22.100
Or you could say something like, you could ask a yes, no question.

12:22.100 --> 12:26.100
You could go, like one of the questions we do is, how soon do you need the service?

12:26.100 --> 12:32.540
And we'll have an option that's like, okay, ASAP, within the week, within the month, or

12:32.540 --> 12:34.140
I'm flexible, okay?

12:34.140 --> 12:39.300
You can ask something like that, but ask at least two questions first and then name, phone

12:39.300 --> 12:42.300
number, email, get my quote.

12:42.300 --> 12:45.460
Anything else outside of this, I would just model over this.

12:45.460 --> 12:50.340
You know, I had a couple of photos, whatever, just make it simple.

12:50.340 --> 12:52.940
Lastly, this content, okay?

12:52.940 --> 12:56.180
You do not have to go and write content from scratch.

12:56.180 --> 13:00.420
You do not need to just go and blast out content, look at your keyword list, do the whole thing.

13:00.420 --> 13:04.620
You're actually free to go and swipe this from this website if you're in concrete, from

13:04.620 --> 13:10.560
another website, if you're in another niche, because, you know, taking someone's content,

13:10.560 --> 13:12.840
you're gonna get what they call black box at some point.

13:12.840 --> 13:16.600
If you copy content, you're gonna get in trouble with Google, they're gonna, you know, not

13:16.600 --> 13:18.240
ever let your site rank.

13:18.240 --> 13:22.520
But we're not trying to make the site rank because if you guys understand the process,

13:22.520 --> 13:26.480
as soon as we get the deal, we're gonna use this one to push the traffic to, we're gonna

13:26.480 --> 13:30.880
get the leads, but once we sign the contract, we're then gonna build out our main website

13:30.880 --> 13:34.640
and that's where we're gonna take the time to build the nice content and the nice photos

13:34.640 --> 13:37.760
and make sure that the site looks a little bit more presentable, et cetera.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.480
This is the down and dirty.

13:39.560 --> 13:44.720
Guys, include these things and remember, and by the way, I do have to say, if you would

13:44.720 --> 13:48.880
like to just go and start testing stuff out, you're free to do that, but what I'm showing

13:48.880 --> 13:55.400
you here, as simple as it looks, is a $1.2 million template and I say that because I've

13:55.400 --> 14:01.840
spent that much money testing and tweaking and dragging and changing and this and that

14:01.840 --> 14:06.600
and I've found that if you do it just like this and include these main couple of things,

14:06.600 --> 14:07.760
you are gonna get leads.
