WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.960
Now that we've picked the right niche and the right city, we want to figure out are

00:14.960 --> 00:21.120
there actually people in that niche and city that are going to be willing to buy our product,

00:21.120 --> 00:22.440
to buy our leads, right?

00:22.440 --> 00:25.760
Because you can pick the right niche and the right city.

00:25.760 --> 00:26.760
You could do everything correct.

00:26.880 --> 00:31.120
You could start getting leads, but if there's no one in that city that wants to buy what

00:31.120 --> 00:34.040
you're selling, it's not worth anything.

00:34.040 --> 00:37.200
So what we're going to talk about is we're going to talk about who we should actually

00:37.200 --> 00:38.200
target.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.120
And what I mean by that is who are the people, who are the business owners that we're going

00:41.120 --> 00:43.240
to go after when we're trying to sell these leads?

00:43.240 --> 00:49.280
A lot of people say, I hate sales, Nick, you know, sales isn't my forte, I'm just not comfortable

00:49.280 --> 00:50.280
doing sales.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.400
I like the technical side and it's just, it's just not me, right?

00:52.400 --> 00:54.680
But I'm going to, I'm going to argue and tell you this.

00:54.720 --> 00:58.960
If you say you hate sales or you haven't had a good experience with sales or the people

00:58.960 --> 01:03.160
that say that, they are talking to the wrong people.

01:03.160 --> 01:06.920
Because when you are selling something that somebody wants, if you're talking to somebody

01:06.920 --> 01:11.320
about something they want, it is a very, very, very enjoyable conversation.

01:11.320 --> 01:15.320
So if you're somebody that's like, oh, I hate sales, or it's just not for me, or you never

01:15.320 --> 01:19.560
had a good experience doing sales, it's because you were trying to sell something to the wrong

01:19.560 --> 01:20.840
person, okay?

01:20.840 --> 01:23.240
And I experienced this, I did door to door sales.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.480
I'd go door to door to door.

01:25.480 --> 01:29.560
And I had no idea if people on the other side of the door wanted home security systems,

01:29.560 --> 01:33.400
I had no idea if they wanted cameras, I had no idea if they wanted door locks, I didn't

01:33.400 --> 01:34.400
know.

01:34.400 --> 01:38.760
With this, what we're going to do is we are only going to target people who are already

01:38.760 --> 01:44.200
sold, people who are already paying for advertising, which is basically like them saying, they're

01:44.200 --> 01:49.280
raising their hand saying, hey, call me, I am interested, I am paying right now with

01:49.280 --> 01:51.480
my own dollars for leads.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.840
And so those are the people that we're going to target.

01:52.840 --> 01:56.520
Okay, guys, the game here is we are going to target people that are already sold.

01:56.520 --> 02:01.240
And the telltale sign that somebody's already sold is they're already paying for advertising,

02:01.240 --> 02:05.760
whether it's Google Ads, HomeAdvisor, Angie's List, you name it, that is a telltale sign

02:05.760 --> 02:06.920
that they are already sold.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.720
So what we're going to do is we're going to come up, we're going to build a list.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.880
Before we ever build a website, before we ever spend a dollar, we are actually going

02:13.880 --> 02:18.520
to build a list of people that are already spending money on these services.

02:18.520 --> 02:19.840
And the reason we're going to do that is two part.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.480
Number one is so that we know that there's a buyer in that market or multiple buyers,

02:23.480 --> 02:24.480
number one.

02:24.480 --> 02:27.600
But number two is when leads start coming in, we don't want to be scrambling.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.920
We don't want leads to be going cold.

02:28.920 --> 02:32.800
We want to have a list already in place where we can just take the lead, hit the list, and

02:32.800 --> 02:34.440
we can get somebody on the hook, okay?

02:34.440 --> 02:39.200
So I want to share my favorite, people that are paying for advertising.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.240
There's different, you know, places that we're going to look and I'm going to share my favorites

02:42.240 --> 02:43.240
in order.

02:43.240 --> 02:48.960
Number one is my number one favorite person to target is somebody paying for Google Ads.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.380
Number two is somebody that's paying for Home Advisor.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.080
Number three, somebody that's paying for Angie's leads list.

02:55.080 --> 02:56.880
I don't even know what it's called anymore.

02:56.880 --> 03:01.920
And then after that, it's, you know, Thumbtack, Yelp, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

03:01.920 --> 03:05.080
And the reason I like Google Ads so much is because of this.

03:05.080 --> 03:09.200
Well, first of all, number one is if somebody's paying for Google Ads and you see they're

03:09.200 --> 03:13.280
paying for Google Ads at that very moment and you see, hey, they're paying for ads,

03:13.280 --> 03:15.360
that means they're paying for ads right then.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.480
And so they currently at that moment are spending money.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.840
Whereas with Home Advisor, they could be on Home Advisor or they could be on Angie's

03:21.840 --> 03:26.160
list listed as a business, but they have shut it off, paused it, et cetera.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.280
So number one is I know they're paying for ads right now.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.980
And number two is with Google Ads, what they're getting is clicks.

03:32.980 --> 03:36.280
They're literally paying for somebody to click on their link.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.480
They're not getting calls.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.880
They're not paying for any of this stuff.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.080
They're getting clicks.

03:40.080 --> 03:44.800
And so what's cool is I can come in and say, hey, you're paying for clicks and I can get

03:44.800 --> 03:46.720
you jobs, right?

03:46.720 --> 03:48.320
You're paying for clicks because you want jobs.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.600
I can get you the jobs.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.960
Last reason why I like Google Ads so much is typically the budgets are a lot higher.

03:54.960 --> 03:59.400
With Home Advisor, you'll see a lot of people paying 300 bucks, 200 bucks, 500 bucks.

03:59.400 --> 04:04.220
With Google Ads, it's very, very common for people to be spending 1,000, 1,500, 2,000.

04:04.220 --> 04:07.960
And so they're already used to paying a decent chunk of change.

04:07.960 --> 04:12.940
So what we're going to do in this entire module is we are going to build a list of business

04:12.940 --> 04:15.540
owners that are already sold on what we're selling.
