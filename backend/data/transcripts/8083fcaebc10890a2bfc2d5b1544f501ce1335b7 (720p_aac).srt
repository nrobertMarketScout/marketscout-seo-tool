In one of your videos I watched recently, I believe you mentioned building out the website after they sign a six-month deal.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:14,100
So do you also build out the site if they sign a three-month contract as well, or do you wait until so?

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,500
That's a good question, Bruce.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
I always build the site as soon as they sign the contract.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,200
Even if it's a three-month deal, I build it out unless it's a new niche, unless it's a niche that I've never done before.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,600
If it's like an excavation niche where I've never done it, I'm not building that site out until I've gone through one client.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,000
They've gone through the three or six months, they re-sign, then I'm going to build it out.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,400
But I don't know if that niche is going to hit, but if it's like a concrete niche or something like that, yeah, even a three month, I'm building that shit.

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,600
I'm going to use the business owner's money to build it, and I'm going to build it right.
