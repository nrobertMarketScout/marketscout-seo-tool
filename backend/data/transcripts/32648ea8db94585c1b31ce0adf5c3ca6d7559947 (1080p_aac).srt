1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
When you are asked a question when you are explaining something or overcoming an objection

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:13,080
You are not going to give an answer from you. You are going to give an answer from a client

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,640
Let me repeat that when you answer an object when somebody asks you a question

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,600
Okay, a client asks you a question. Hey, how are you different the home advisor? Hey, how does your pricing work?

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,400
Hey, how do you guys do flat fee?

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,560
Etc or when you are doing your screencast or you're overcoming an objection, you know is going to come up

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,800
Instead of answering it just blah and this is what this is the answer

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,520
You're going to take a little bit more time and you're gonna answer that question

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:51,000
By using a client's answer to answer that question. Okay, that might be a sound a little bit confusing. It's really really simple

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, let me give you an example

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,080
Client asks you you jump on the phone. You're doing your prospecting. You're hooking the business owner

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,440
Like we talked about in step three or sorry step four module four

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm losing my numbers here in module four where you're actually hooking the business owner

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,600
You call them they're interested you go through the script and you're kind of at the end and they're one of those people that starts asking

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,880
Questions, right they keep asking questions and you're trying to like avoid it, but they keep asking

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,800
Okay, so business owner for example, they would say something like

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,640
Okay

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,880
So tell me real quick before we end this like how are you different than home advisor?

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,240
Okay, most of us would start rambling on well

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,480
We we don't we don't do shared leads number one, sir

21
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,720
well, I

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:47,580
Mean whatever the 17,000 different reasons and canned responses are we we work exclusively with one company

23
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:55,020
We make sure the leads are qualified but whatever whatever the reasons are that you give of saying you're different than home advisor

24
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,340
Once you respond they expect you to have a certain response like they know you've been asked

25
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,340
So when you say it it is what it is

26
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,740
But here's what you're gonna do is instead of answering that

27
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,860
You know answering that question just the way that that you hear it or the way you understand it

28
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,540
You're gonna use a client. Okay, so for example

29
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,120
This is how you're gonna answer instead of saying yeah

30
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,900
Well, we don't do exclusive leads you could say well, and this is kind of the response

31
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,460
I like to give is if somebody says something like that and say hey, what's the difference between you and home advisor?

32
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,780
Well, and I'd say something like well, basically the only thing that's the same as we work with contractors

33
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,540
No, but for real and then this is what I would say I'd say so I'd say no

34
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,140
But for real like we have a guy his name is Joe

35
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,420
He's he's our duct cleaning client in Chicago. You can look up his site as Chicago duct cleaning

36
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,460
And his biggest thing because he was working

37
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,260
He was actually working just like you with home advisor for like three years

38
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,700
His biggest thing and we just talked him last week is he's keep saying over and over is like dude

39
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,500
Just the fact that I don't have to worry about

40
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,900
Competing with four other companies in town and I have the lead exclusively to myself has made all the difference in the world

41
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,900
So just so you know, we work with one company exclusively and we don't share the leads

42
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,020
You say that guys you use it like that

43
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,700
It's a little bit it takes a little bit more effort of thinking and it gets it gets easier

44
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:24,980
But you use that and now it's not me saying it's Joe. It's Joe the duck cleaner in Chicago

45
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:33,140
It not only does it hold way more weight, but it also builds authority and it removes the objection of trust

46
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:39,020
Okay, it removes the objection of trust because now you're not just some random schmo

47
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:46,340
That's in his mom's basement now. You're a human being that has other clients. You're a human being that has other clients in Chicago

48
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,020
You're a human being that has other clients in duck cleaning, which is the same industry as this guy

49
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,420
So just doing that simple thing you are removing this objection. There's a huge objection of trust
