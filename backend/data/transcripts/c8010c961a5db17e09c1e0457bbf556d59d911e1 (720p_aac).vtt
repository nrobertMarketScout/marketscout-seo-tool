00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
When doing due diligence, what are the ideal numbers

00:02.160 --> 00:04.960
when looking for backlinks and citations, et cetera?

00:04.960 --> 00:07.920
Okay, so as part of the due diligence,

00:07.920 --> 00:09.000
you guys have probably noticed,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
and we've talked about this in the training,

00:11.000 --> 00:12.480
that one of the things you're gonna look at

00:12.480 --> 00:16.160
is how many backlinks do your competitors have, right?

00:16.160 --> 00:18.480
And you can use this, do this with other tools,

00:18.480 --> 00:21.040
but that's the wrong question, Jaylen,

00:21.040 --> 00:22.040
and I'm gonna tell you why.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.640
Not because you said anything wrong,

00:23.640 --> 00:28.640
but because it doesn't matter how many backlinks they have.

00:28.680 --> 00:32.200
What matters is the quality of the backlinks that they have,

00:32.200 --> 00:34.080
and I'm gonna explain it like this.

00:34.080 --> 00:39.080
If I were to offer you, say, 100 links from whatever,

00:41.600 --> 00:45.600
random directory sites, whatever,

00:45.600 --> 00:50.040
or I would give you one link from Forbes,

00:51.240 --> 00:55.760
which one do you think would help you more, okay?

00:55.760 --> 00:59.400
I would take the Forbes one all day.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.240
Why?

01:00.240 --> 01:03.560
Because unless one of those 100 is some crazy site,

01:03.560 --> 01:06.400
unless one of those 100 is entrepreneur,

01:06.400 --> 01:10.680
that Forbes article is gonna hold far more weight

01:10.680 --> 01:14.880
with Google than 100 of these little ones.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.400
Going back to the social example,

01:17.400 --> 01:21.000
you being friends and homies with the quarterback

01:21.000 --> 01:24.800
or with the student body president holds far more weight

01:24.800 --> 01:27.160
than you being friends with all the ninth graders,

01:27.160 --> 01:29.880
if you're a ninth grader, right, that are no-namers, right?

01:29.880 --> 01:30.720
And again, we're just talking

01:30.720 --> 01:32.400
about some stupid popularity contest,

01:32.400 --> 01:33.960
but that's kind of what this is.

01:34.840 --> 01:38.120
So it's not about how many, it's about the quality.

01:38.120 --> 01:40.760
So what you guys need to make sure you're doing is,

01:40.760 --> 01:43.280
yes, how many backlinks they have,

01:43.280 --> 01:46.040
but the backlinks they do have,

01:47.440 --> 01:49.280
how are, what are those backlinks like?

01:49.280 --> 01:50.680
Are those good backlinks?

01:50.680 --> 01:52.440
Do those have domain authority?

01:52.440 --> 01:53.680
Do those have trust flow?

01:53.720 --> 01:55.040
Do those have citation flow?

01:55.040 --> 01:57.160
These are all things that we're gonna be getting into.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.120
So it's not an ideal number of backlinks,

02:00.120 --> 02:03.360
but what I look for is I'm looking for people

02:03.360 --> 02:08.360
that are ranking, that have no backlinks is great,

02:08.640 --> 02:10.880
but maybe they have three or four backlinks

02:10.880 --> 02:13.600
and they are no follow-back links,

02:13.600 --> 02:16.840
which we'll get into in a later video and into the training,

02:16.840 --> 02:20.440
or there do follow, or there do follow backlinks

02:20.440 --> 02:24.200
that have no juice or they're no follow backlinks, okay?

02:24.200 --> 02:26.080
And they only have a couple of them.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.040
So I, the question, how I wanna answer this,

02:29.040 --> 02:31.080
it doesn't, it's not about how many,

02:31.080 --> 02:32.600
it's about the quality.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.600
And if they have 10 backlinks that have zero trust flow

02:36.600 --> 02:38.920
and a little bit of citation flow,

02:38.920 --> 02:40.880
I don't even view that as a big deal

02:40.880 --> 02:43.960
because I can go and get one good backlink

02:43.960 --> 02:47.960
and I'm gonna beat their 10 crappy backlinks

02:47.960 --> 02:50.240
that maybe are no follow-back links

02:50.240 --> 02:51.280
or maybe don't have any juice.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.000
So amazing question.
