00:00.000 --> 00:09.360
What's important that you guys understand is who we're actually writing this content

00:09.360 --> 00:10.360
for.

00:10.360 --> 00:14.080
And a lot of people when they get into this business, into the rank and rent digital real

00:14.080 --> 00:21.160
estate space, or may I say rent then rank digital real estate space, they're confused

00:21.160 --> 00:23.840
because they think their content has to be perfect.

00:23.840 --> 00:29.000
And I'm just coming off my last video telling you we need to get obsessed and we need to

00:29.080 --> 00:32.840
get really good at the content, but what you guys have to understand is who we're actually

00:32.840 --> 00:35.160
writing the content for.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.360
And I'm gonna just have you think about it like this, okay?

00:38.360 --> 00:43.320
If you are sitting there and your tree, a lightning, whatever, lightning came or the

00:43.320 --> 00:48.360
wind came and your tree like cracked in half and it was leaning over your roof, and you're

00:48.360 --> 00:51.440
looking to get it solved, you're looking to get a tree company to come out and remove

00:51.440 --> 00:57.520
it, are you gonna go and search tree company near me and go read every word on that tree

00:57.520 --> 00:58.880
company's website?

00:58.920 --> 01:04.400
Are you gonna go and read every single thing about how to remove a tree and what processes

01:04.400 --> 01:07.880
we use and what saws and all this extraction methods?

01:07.880 --> 01:09.880
Of course not, right?

01:09.880 --> 01:13.800
So what you have to realize is in the services that we talk about, in the services that I

01:13.800 --> 01:19.560
recommend in module one of part one of digital landlords, which is looking for layups, which

01:19.560 --> 01:22.320
is picking the right niche, okay?

01:22.320 --> 01:27.920
We are going into services where people just need the work done, that's the point.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.480
They're not going to read the content, they're not.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.440
And I'm telling you right now, I always joke about this, but if you've got somebody who

01:33.440 --> 01:39.240
is reading every word of your website, that person is very likely a serial killer.

01:39.240 --> 01:44.960
Who reads tree service content or mold removal content or duct cleaning content, and I'll

01:44.960 --> 01:49.200
argue if somebody calls me on a quote form and says, hey, I read every word in your content,

01:49.200 --> 01:50.200
what is this?

01:50.200 --> 01:52.480
I'm not even gonna give that to the business owner anyway because they're literally probably

01:52.480 --> 01:54.480
on the hit list, okay?

01:54.480 --> 01:56.920
Or on America's top ten, that's weird.

01:56.920 --> 02:00.280
No one's reading this stuff, so who are we writing it for?

02:00.280 --> 02:04.200
We're writing it for Google, we're writing it for the search engine, so we're writing

02:04.200 --> 02:09.360
it so that when the search engine crawls our page, aka reads our website or our homepage

02:09.360 --> 02:12.160
or service pages, they know what it's about.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.040
They know that it's about the keywords that we want to rank for.

02:15.040 --> 02:22.720
They know it's about concrete contractors, concrete near me, cost of concrete, concrete

02:23.440 --> 02:29.840
my area, whatever the keywords are, we want Google to know that our website is about that.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.700
So what I want you to do is take a deep breath.

02:32.700 --> 02:34.240
This doesn't need to be perfect.

02:34.240 --> 02:38.960
It does not need to pass, you probably had an English teacher like I did that was very

02:38.960 --> 02:43.200
critical of making sure that it read properly and all these different things.

02:43.200 --> 02:47.560
Now you have to make sure this does not sound like it was written by a robot, so you have

02:47.560 --> 02:51.560
to give it some thought, and as we start getting an outsourcing, that's one of the things we

02:51.560 --> 02:52.560
have to look at.

02:52.560 --> 02:57.360
We have to make sure that it sounds like it's actually a human, but outside of that, it

02:57.360 --> 02:58.800
doesn't need to be interesting.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.960
It doesn't need to have voice, and the content writers that I've hired in the past, where

03:02.960 --> 03:06.640
Pete, they've tried to overdo it and ham it up and have too much personality, it just

03:06.640 --> 03:07.640
doesn't work.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.040
So guys, take a deep breath.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.600
We're writing this for the search engines.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.800
Don't stress it too much.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.800
Just make it sound like a human wrote it.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.440
Do, and lastly, do not plagiarize.

03:17.440 --> 03:20.640
If you plagiarize, it isn't going to hurt the person that you stole it from.

03:20.640 --> 03:26.760
It's going to hurt your website, and you can run the risk of getting sandboxed, blacklisted,

03:26.760 --> 03:29.680
whatever you want to call it, deplatformed from Google.

03:29.680 --> 03:30.920
They do not like that.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.160
Do not plagiarize content.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.160
It is not worth it.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.160
It is not worth even risking.

03:36.160 --> 03:40.240
Those are the little tips I want to share, and in the next videos, we're going to talk

03:40.240 --> 03:48.280
about actually writing the content.
