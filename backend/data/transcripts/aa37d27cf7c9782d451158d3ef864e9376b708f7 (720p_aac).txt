Okay, B says, Nick, what do you do when people call
and ask if this is so-and-so company when you run ads?
Do you do something to make the ads stop generating those?
No, so what I usually do is I usually try my best
to turn those into leads.
So we'll say, no, did you already call us?
Or we'll usually just say,
were you looking for an estimate?
Oh, yeah, but I was looking for so-and-so company
or they already gave me an estimate.
Oh, okay, cool.
Well, we'd love to give you another estimate.
Are you open to getting another free estimate?
And we'll just try and turn it into another lead.
