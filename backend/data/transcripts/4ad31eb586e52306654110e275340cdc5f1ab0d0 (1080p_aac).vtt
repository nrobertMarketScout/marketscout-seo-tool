00:00.000 --> 00:15.320
Guys, before we get into the Costco sample strategy too heavily, I want to remind you

00:15.320 --> 00:20.080
that every single thing that we have done up to this point leads to this moment.

00:20.080 --> 00:24.560
The reason that this process works is because we give results in advance.

00:24.560 --> 00:29.360
We give people value and the goal is to give more value than they can pay for.

00:29.440 --> 00:32.960
We want to give our free stuff, we want to make it better than their paid stuff.

00:34.480 --> 00:37.120
There's no coincidence that that's what I'm doing in the free group.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.480
I'm trying to give this as an example.

00:38.480 --> 00:43.440
I'm trying to show you guys if you give free value that's better than most people's paid,

00:43.440 --> 00:44.720
people will buy.

00:44.720 --> 00:45.760
That's the reason you're here.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.400
I don't want to overwhelm you.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.440
I don't want to freak you out.

00:49.440 --> 00:54.720
I don't want you to overthink it, but I do want you to remember everything leads here

00:54.720 --> 00:57.760
and I've seen a few people in the past.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.440
They've done everything right up to this point.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.600
They've hooked the business owner and they think the deal is done.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.640
They think it's over.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.240
Guys, it is not over.

01:04.240 --> 01:05.680
You do not skip this step.

01:05.680 --> 01:07.120
You do not gloss over this step.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.600
You do not do this step differently than I'm going to teach you.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.720
There is a correct way to send these samples.

01:12.720 --> 01:16.080
There is an incorrect way to send these samples and I've done all of them.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.360
I've tried all of them.

01:17.360 --> 01:17.840
Trust me.

01:18.560 --> 01:21.200
I'm going to teach you the way and some of you guys are going to listen to this way and go,

01:21.200 --> 01:23.040
oh man, that takes a couple of steps.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.000
Yes, it does, but it's going to speed the deal up.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.200
It's going to overcut.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.320
I'm going to get into all that in a moment.

01:28.320 --> 01:33.440
I just want to stress the importance that this step is so important and this isn't a

01:33.440 --> 01:38.800
super long module, but I want you to do this exactly as I teach it because this is key

01:38.800 --> 01:39.840
to everything.

01:40.640 --> 01:43.600
First of all, what I want to talk about is what is the Costco sample strategy?

01:43.600 --> 01:44.320
Why do we call it that?

01:44.960 --> 01:47.440
Costco is what they call a big box retailer.

01:47.440 --> 01:51.200
Basically, for those of you that don't know, it's like a huge grocery store,

01:51.920 --> 01:54.640
but the difference is you go in, they sell huge quantities.

01:54.640 --> 01:59.040
Instead of selling a candy bar, they sell packs of 30 candy bars.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.400
Instead of selling cheese, they sell bricks of cheese.

02:02.400 --> 02:06.000
Instead of selling laundry detergent, they sell cases of it.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.360
You have to have a membership and all this stuff, but what they do is on Saturdays,

02:09.360 --> 02:15.040
every single Saturday, you can go in and at the end caps in different places throughout the store,

02:15.680 --> 02:17.040
they position these booths.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.480
These booths have these different products that they're trying to sell.

02:20.480 --> 02:23.520
It's juice, it's cheese, it's sausage, it's bread.

02:23.520 --> 02:28.000
They stick somebody behind these booths and all they do is they cook this food or they

02:28.000 --> 02:30.480
pour these drinks and they hand samples out.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.920
These people don't have sales experience.

02:31.920 --> 02:37.120
These people are typically seniors who are literally just trying to make enough money

02:37.120 --> 02:37.600
to live.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.360
They're not high energy, young salespeople.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.480
These are just people just doing their job, handing out samples.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.880
I don't even think they train them on sales experience at all.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.720
I don't think they train them at all.

02:48.960 --> 02:54.240
Okay, but Costco's figured out that if you have a product that is good,

02:54.240 --> 02:59.600
if you have a juice that tastes amazing, all you got to do is get people to try it

02:59.600 --> 03:00.880
and they will buy, okay?

03:01.760 --> 03:04.480
And it is exactly what we're doing, right?

03:04.480 --> 03:07.200
We know our product's amazing, but we got to get people to try it.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.720
And we want to do it with no risk.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.640
We don't want them to have to pay for it in advance.

03:10.640 --> 03:17.120
We want them to try it without having any type of payment without any type of risk, okay?

03:17.120 --> 03:20.320
So that is why we call it the Costco sample strategy.

03:20.320 --> 03:25.440
We are going to give the samples, okay, without asking for anything in advance.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.440
We're just going to give them results in advance.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.680
And this does a couple of things that I want to go over really quick.

03:29.680 --> 03:35.040
The number one thing that doing this does is it overcomes the objection of trust.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.240
I'm telling you guys, after having done sales for almost 10 years now,

03:38.240 --> 03:41.920
the number one objection that's going to kill deals is trust.

03:41.920 --> 03:45.600
If someone can't trust you, they will not buy, period.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.240
And I could say that 100 times and I probably wouldn't say it enough.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.440
You can do everything correctly.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.560
You can have the perfect product.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.360
They can need it.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.000
They can want it.

03:52.000 --> 03:52.960
They can have the budget.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.040
Everything can make sense, but if they don't trust you, they will not buy.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.800
If there is any doubt in their mind that your service is going to work,

04:01.920 --> 04:03.520
they will not buy, okay?

04:03.520 --> 04:05.520
So by sending these results in advance,

04:05.520 --> 04:09.120
it is the quickest, fastest way to overcome the objection of trust.

04:09.120 --> 04:12.400
And a lot of people think that the way to overcome trust is having a fancy website,

04:13.120 --> 04:17.440
you know, having these little blurbs of customer testimonials at the bottom,

04:17.440 --> 04:18.720
having reviews.

04:18.720 --> 04:19.680
Guess what, guys?

04:19.680 --> 04:21.520
I have never had an agency website.

04:21.520 --> 04:26.400
And I've worked with companies doing $500 million in a year, okay?

04:26.400 --> 04:29.200
They own multiple companies under their umbrella

04:29.200 --> 04:30.800
and they have never looked at my website.

04:30.800 --> 04:31.680
And you know why?

04:31.680 --> 04:37.360
It's because I overcome the objection of trust by giving them results in advance, okay?

04:37.360 --> 04:39.440
Those of you that are in this program watching this,

04:39.440 --> 04:41.040
notice we never had a landing page.

04:41.040 --> 04:44.480
Notice there's no page that has the fancy this and the fancy that

04:44.480 --> 04:46.720
and it's laid out and it's sponsored by this

04:46.720 --> 04:49.040
and it's approved by this and a stamp of approval by that.

04:49.600 --> 04:54.080
You guys know that this works because you have seen how good my free content is

04:54.080 --> 04:58.080
and so it only makes sense that my paid stuff is that much better, okay?

04:58.080 --> 05:01.920
So the number one thing that this does by sending the results in advance

05:01.920 --> 05:06.080
and by doing the Costco sample strategy is it overcomes the objection of trust.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.760
The second thing that it does is it demands,

05:09.760 --> 05:13.200
actually it demands and commands attention, okay?

05:13.200 --> 05:15.120
Because no one else is doing it.

05:15.120 --> 05:19.120
Nobody else is doing it and especially the way that we do it, okay?

05:19.120 --> 05:21.520
I had one of our students, we recently interviewed her

05:21.520 --> 05:24.640
and she said something to the effect that she got talking to this business owner

05:24.640 --> 05:28.560
and she said, hey, you know, we do leads, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.760
And the business owner cut her off and said, yeah, everybody does leads now.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.320
Home advisor does leads and this and she said, yeah,

05:34.320 --> 05:38.560
but do they give you free results in advance before they ever ask for a dollar?

05:39.520 --> 05:41.200
And the business owner just kind of stopped

05:41.200 --> 05:44.640
and didn't really know what to say and said, well, no, okay?

05:44.640 --> 05:47.920
Guys, you have to realize and I think sometimes we forget because we do it

05:47.920 --> 05:51.680
and we do it so often, we are literally giving them liquid gold,

05:51.680 --> 05:55.120
not liquid gold, digital gold, right?

05:55.120 --> 05:58.160
We're giving them jobs that if you're in the right niches

05:58.160 --> 06:02.400
can be worth and are worth thousands and thousands of dollars, okay?

06:02.400 --> 06:04.880
So second thing it does, it commands and demands attention.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.040
The third thing this does, it shows the business owner,

06:07.040 --> 06:10.240
we're not messing around, we mean business, we're calling them

06:10.240 --> 06:13.760
and we are giving them results in advance, we mean business,

06:13.760 --> 06:15.760
we're here to do a deal, we're not here to mess around,

06:15.760 --> 06:19.680
we're not here to play around, we are here to get it done.

06:19.680 --> 06:25.040
And so those three things are what allows the deal to be sped up,

06:25.040 --> 06:27.440
it's what allows us to overcome the trust

06:27.440 --> 06:31.840
and it's what allows the business owner to know, hey, this guy, this girl, this lady,

06:31.840 --> 06:32.800
they're messing around.

06:32.800 --> 06:38.960
Last thing guys, we are going to be doing these Costco samples live, okay?

06:38.960 --> 06:41.600
We are not gonna be doing a text message,

06:41.600 --> 06:42.960
we're not gonna be doing an email,

06:42.960 --> 06:46.080
we sure as hell aren't gonna forward the calls directly to them in the beginning,

06:46.080 --> 06:49.120
we are going to be doing these live, okay?

06:49.120 --> 06:52.080
And the reason why we do it live is because we,

06:53.040 --> 06:56.320
I personally and many of our students have experiences in the past

06:56.320 --> 06:58.960
where they hear of this concept, they're like, yeah, that makes sense.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.080
You give people results up front and you go and close them.

07:02.080 --> 07:06.160
What happens is if you do this incorrectly and you just send over the leads

07:06.160 --> 07:07.680
or you just forward the leads,

07:07.680 --> 07:10.000
you'll jump on the call, the Zoom call at the end

07:10.000 --> 07:13.280
and you're jacked, you're like, dude, I've sent 20 leads to this guy,

07:13.280 --> 07:15.760
20 leads to this lady, she's gonna be closed.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.760
You get on and you find out they've gotten a hold of one,

07:19.760 --> 07:21.200
they've gotten a hold of two

07:21.200 --> 07:23.600
and they haven't even given estimates to those two yet

07:23.600 --> 07:25.040
or they've scheduled estimates

07:25.040 --> 07:26.880
but they haven't even gone out to the estimates.

07:26.880 --> 07:31.360
And literally, it doesn't, like you sending the 20 leads did nothing, okay?

07:31.920 --> 07:33.440
And so the reason that we do it live

07:33.440 --> 07:36.560
is it allows us to control the entire process, okay?

07:36.560 --> 07:39.600
It allows us to hand them a hot lead.

07:40.400 --> 07:43.680
It allows us to hand it off so they don't say something wrong.

07:43.680 --> 07:48.640
It allows us to show them exactly what they're getting, okay?

07:48.640 --> 07:52.640
And so doing this live is such an important piece of this puzzle.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.520
We're gonna get into that later

07:53.520 --> 07:57.920
and if you can't do it live and if you have a job, that doesn't matter.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.400
We have solutions around that

08:00.400 --> 08:05.280
but I do wanna tell you, if at all possible, we want to do these live.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.000
Doing this live is the equivalent of Costco.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.200
This is something they don't do.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.360
This is the one thing I think they could do even better

08:11.360 --> 08:14.080
is imagine if Costco that gives these free samples,

08:14.080 --> 08:15.520
imagine if they came and they said,

08:15.520 --> 08:18.960
hey, you can have this sample, this cookie is free,

08:18.960 --> 08:21.440
this drink is free, this cheese is free

08:21.440 --> 08:23.760
but you need to stand right there and I need to watch you eat it.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.280
And that'd be a little bit weird

08:25.280 --> 08:28.080
but the truth is sometimes I remember and I still do this,

08:28.080 --> 08:30.960
I'll go and I'll grab the sample and then I'll kind of smell it

08:30.960 --> 08:34.240
or I'll look at it or I'll give it to my kid or I'll throw it away

08:34.240 --> 08:37.440
and if I don't taste it, I'm never gonna buy it, okay?

08:37.440 --> 08:39.360
So it's almost like a waste of the sample

08:39.360 --> 08:41.440
but if Costco said, hey, you can have a sample,

08:41.440 --> 08:42.880
in fact, I'll give you three of them

08:42.880 --> 08:43.840
but I want you to try them.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.040
I want you to eat them right here

08:45.040 --> 08:48.080
so I can see that you taste it, that you can try it, okay?

08:48.080 --> 08:52.720
Because if your product is good, it's gonna sell itself

08:52.720 --> 08:53.840
but they have to try it.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.920
And so the reason that we do it live

08:55.920 --> 08:59.840
is it forces the business owner to try and to taste our samples

08:59.840 --> 09:03.120
and what's crazy and what's cool is we actually know

09:03.120 --> 09:05.520
they're already in the market for this, okay?

09:05.520 --> 09:09.600
This is like somebody already being in the market for cheese

09:09.600 --> 09:10.960
and somebody at Costco being like,

09:10.960 --> 09:13.920
hey, I know you're looking to buy cheese, come try this one, okay?

09:13.920 --> 09:16.560
They don't do that, they give every sample to everyone.

09:16.560 --> 09:19.520
We're only giving our samples to people that are looking

09:19.520 --> 09:24.160
and already paying for a product or service similar, okay?

09:24.160 --> 09:25.840
So just before we jump into this,

09:25.840 --> 09:27.280
I wanna stress the importance.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.720
Do not skip this step.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.200
This step is an absolute game changer.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.440
Doing it correctly is a game changer.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.200
Don't breeze through this, don't rush through this,

09:37.200 --> 09:39.600
don't think that the deal is done, it is far from done.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.440
Do this correctly and we will close deals

09:41.440 --> 09:42.560
and we'll close them fast.
