00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Okay, Simon has an interesting question.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,320
He says, what do you think about e-comm

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,120
with the digital asset approach?

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,140
Can he do it?

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,320
Guys, my answer to this is whether you're asking me

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,440
about pull barns, whether you're asking me

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,480
about assisted living leads,

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,960
whether you're asking me about whatever,

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,120
if you use this strategy, which is getting paid traffic

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,760
or organic traffic to a landing page or to a website,

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,240
you are going to get leads or conversions.

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,700
Because if you're selling a product,

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,440
the same principles apply.

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,980
However, the thing that makes this model so special

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,360
is the fact that we can use a generic website.

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,580
And if, let's say our client starts to get sideways on us,

17
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,000
they start to get a little funny, they start to complain,

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,040
we can sell those leads to somebody else.

19
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,480
So if you do e-comm, let's say you go to a company

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,540
and they're like, hey, I want you to sell

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,560
these water filters for us, right?

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,360
And you're doing all this SEO for these water filters.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,000
That's great, but first of all, first and foremost,

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,920
you're probably gonna be doing SEO on like a national level,

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,880
which makes it very difficult.

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,960
It's gonna be much more difficult to get SEO,

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,040
to rank using SEO, to get organic rankings.

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,480
The other thing, guys, is that company's kind of gonna

29
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,000
have you buy the balls, right?

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,560
Because if you're advertising their products

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
and you're using their branding or their location

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,000
or their specific keywords that they wanna target,

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,120
what happens if they don't wanna buy leads anymore?

34
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,480
So you have to remember that one of the best parts

35
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,440
about this business model is the ability

36
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,880
to have complete control over our assets

37
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,600
and not have to be at the mercy of anybody.

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,360
And this kind of defeats the purpose of it.

39
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,560
So could it work?

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,400
Yes.

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,220
Do I recommend it?

42
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,060
No.

43
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,120
If it's your own brand and it's your own e-comm products,

44
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,560
your own e-comm store, your own products,

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,940
then okay, fine, use the SEO principles

46
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,480
in the second half of the training

47
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,840
to get your website ranked.

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,360
But to do it for somebody else,

49
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,760
I don't think it's the move.
