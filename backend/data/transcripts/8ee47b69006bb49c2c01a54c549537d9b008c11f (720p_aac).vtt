Zolan, my problem is I'm so focused on finding an EMD available for a city.

00:05.280 --> 00:09.840
If it isn't available, I move on. Dude, quit worrying about exact match domains, bro.

00:09.840 --> 00:13.040
The domain doesn't matter. And by the way, I'm not mad. I'm just telling you.

00:13.840 --> 00:21.040
Doesn't matter. Does not matter. This is my format. I do the city. I do

00:22.560 --> 00:26.480
Bentonville Concrete. Second option is Concrete Bentonville.

00:27.120 --> 00:32.240
Third option is Bentonville dash like hyphen concrete dot com.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.080
The next option after that would probably be.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.800
I don't know if you'd have to go pass up, but if you did, I might do. I've done this before

00:40.800 --> 00:47.360
and ranked it Bentonville concrete co dot com. I have a St. George concrete co dot com is ranking

00:47.360 --> 00:52.640
guys. The domain doesn't matter. You don't need the exact match. Okay. We're in local. We're not

00:52.640 --> 00:58.800
ranking sex toys nationally, which would be very difficult. Okay. Because that's highly searched.
