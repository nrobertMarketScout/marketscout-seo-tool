1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,320
Heard over and over and over and over and over in the first couple of trainings that I took and I've bought a lot

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,080
Of programs have taken a lot of courses

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,340
I kept hearing the same thing the riches are in the niches the riches are in the niches Nick

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,160
You've got to find some crazy niche that you know

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,200
no one's ever thought of it's it's you know, and I heard niches like

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,280
Let's think of a couple examples

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,960
Well drilling and chicken coop building and just these crazy things and feng shui feng shui

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,040
Whatever that one is and I thought in order for me to be successful

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,040
I had to find some crazy niche that no one had ever

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,480
You know thought about tapped into whatever and then I was gonna just take it vertical and I was gonna make millions dollars

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,480
that's what I thought okay, and

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,640
What I realized is that although I know you can make money doing that

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,680
I know people that have I

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,880
Also know and this is how I made my money is you can also make your money by going into boring

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,080
Regular niches that you've already thought of that you've already heard of that work

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,820
We know they work because other people are making money in them and you focus on finding cities

18
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,960
That are untouched, right?

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,880
So instead of obscure niche its obscure city

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,160
And so what I argue is instead of the riches are in the niches

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,320
I believe the riches are actually in the cities

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,400
So what you need to realize is as you're going through and we're gonna pick our niche in this section first of all

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,940
We're not gonna overthink this because a lot of people get hung up wouldn't it should I go into oh my gosh

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,640
You know the world's ending. I don't want to make the wrong move. No, we're not gonna do that

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,120
Okay, but you either need to go into a really obscure niche that you can then go into most any city because no one's done it

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,160
Or you do what I did which is you go into some regular niches that we know work

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,160
okay, and I'm gonna go into some of those are getting a couple of examples and

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:05,640
You take these regular niches and you spend your time finding cities that nobody has thought of heard of or would even

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:13,160
Consider going into but you know because I'm gonna teach you that this this this and this all match up and you are going

30
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,600
To have success. Okay

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,640
So you need either need to pick an obscure city and a regular niche or an obscure niche

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,000
And then you can go into regular cities

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,520
All right

34
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,720
so it's when it comes to niching there's a couple of criteria that you need to look at and that I

35
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,040
Really really really really strongly feel that need to happen

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,920
so

37
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,080
Number one is the niche that you select needs to be medium to high ticket now the way that I define this is

38
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,800
Where oh by the way, we're talking about what the customer charges to the the homeowner

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,820
Okay, so customer goes in your customer goes in talks to the homeowner performs the service performs the job

40
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,480
What did they charge that needs to be medium to high ticket?

41
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,540
So I would consider medium to high ticket at the bare minimum a thousand dollars. Okay gross

42
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,000
So they're charging the right in an invoice for a thousand bucks up to

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,480
1015 K and I'm not gonna go too deep into this

44
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,920
But I actually don't like it to go much past that because then we get into a long sales cycle

45
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,920
And it's a little bit more difficult to do

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,480
However, I would err on the high side rather than the low side and it's very simple

47
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,280
The reason that we do this is if the customer can charge high prices to their customers the homeowners

48
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
There's gonna be more money

49
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,520
For us to charge higher retainers

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:40,800
It's also gonna be easier for us to justify a higher ticket price when we go and charge them monthly or weekly for our service

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,880
Okay

52
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,600
Second thing when we're talking about niche criteria is there has to be good demand

53
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,640
There has to be good volume and what I mean by that is there has to be a certain amount of people

54
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,040
Actually searching for that service in that city. Okay, because for example

55
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,720
Let's take the niche artificial grass, which actually is a really good niche

56
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,560
It's one I'm gonna I'm gonna explain here in a moment that niche is excellent in some cities

57
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,200
but if you were to type in artificial grass in

58
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,760
For example the city that I grew up in which is this not even a city it's a little town first of all

59
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,920
There's not you know that many people there. But secondly

60
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,680
People there don't spend that much money on their yards

61
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,120
And so if you started looking at the metrics you would quickly see there is not that many searches

62
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,920
There's not that much demand for artificial grass in the city. In fact, I don't know one person in the city

63
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,120
I grew up that has artificial grass. I can't think of one house

64
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,280
So we do need to make sure there is

65
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,000
Good demand good search volume. I'm gonna show you how to do that. Don't stress about it

66
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,280
The third thing is there needs to be no brand loyalty

67
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,760
What I mean by that is with let's take a niche like concrete

68
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:55,360
Okay, when I got my concrete done, I extended my pool deck. This is last summer. I

69
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,240
Went in and I looked at well, this is actually a little bit different for me because I had some clients

70
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,000
But I went and got a couple of estimates. Okay, and I did not check if they had a license

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,800
I didn't have them send me previous projects. I didn't like I didn't care about any of that

72
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,640
I just said hey and I had one of them was my client. I had him come give me a bid

73
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,640
I had a couple other people give me bids. I

74
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Didn't care what they're I didn't even know what the company LLC was called or their their business, right?

75
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,360
So we want those type of niches because when we build a site

76
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,640
That is branded very generically right or unbranded

77
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,040
We want to be able to make sure that people are still gonna call us

78
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,600
So an example of this is like for for like solar

79
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,360
Solar panels, right if you're gonna put solar on your house, you're going to check out who the company is

80
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,680
You're gonna check out the reviews. You're gonna want to see the projects

81
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,040
They've done you want to see the license and this then blah blah blah blah, because that's a huge business

82
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,000
It's a big commitment. So that for example is a niche that is very brand loyal

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,680
So just to recap on those two things number one is you want to make sure it's medium to high ticket

84
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,400
You want to make sure there is good volume and you want to make sure there is no brand loyalty

85
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,800
All right

86
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,360
Let me give you some good examples of good niches that I would recommend going into and some examples of bad niches

87
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,720
So good examples

88
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
Concrete and these are all by the way

89
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,120
I don't give you examples unless I've made money concrete one of my favorite niches tree service great niche

90
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,680
artificial grass awesome niche spray foam insulation awesome niche

91
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,160
Masonry block wall awesome niche. I'm trying to think if there's anything else comes to my mind

92
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,840
Duck cleaning is is kind of in that gray area. It's a little bit too low ticket. I won't do duck cleaning anymore

93
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,560
It's not terrible. You could probably sneak, you know a decent sized deal, but it's it's an okay niche

94
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,720
I don't love it. Okay

95
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,240
bad examples, okay, so those are good ones bad ones

96
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,280
Dentistry, okay anything like medical like that because people are gonna want to have some brand loyalty solar

97
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,600
Okay, these two I'm gonna share might shock you a little bit roofing

98
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,280
Roofing is pretty brand-loyal. There's so much money in roofing that people are spending ridiculous amounts of money on advertising

99
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,640
They're buying billboards. They got custom wraps in their cars and I'll bet you as you're watching this

100
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,000
There's probably one person if you think who's the roofing boss in my town

101
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,680
There's somebody that comes to mind

102
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,360
Whereas with concrete there's not really like, you know

103
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:30,560
The guy or the company the girl that's out there. That's like that's the the concrete person, you know

104
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,800
It's there's very little brand loyalty. So dentistry

105
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,280
roofing solar

106
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,200
Another one I found to be very difficult as HVAC. That's a pretty brand loyal deal

107
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,160
Electrician for whatever reason has been not great

108
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,280
So good ones tree service spray from insulation concrete, etc bad ones

109
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,360
Dentistry anything medical roofing solar

110
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,880
Whatever. Now one little caveat is if you're gonna look at a niche like roofing don't do it

111
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:07,200
However, I have made a decent amount of money in roof repair because it's more niche more niche

112
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,120
More whatever you want to call it then roofing not as many people want to go after it

113
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,960
not as many people care because they're just coming to fix a tile or coming to fix this or that and so those are

114
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,600
The good examples was the bad example

115
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,840
So guys I'm gonna show you a couple of examples of some niches that I have gone into and made some money

116
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,840
Some decent amounts of money in these niches. So

117
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,440
First one is tree service

118
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,560
As you can see st. George tree service

119
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,200
I'm actually what's interesting about this one is I have made over

120
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,960
$20,000 in this specific niche and this specific city. So this website, okay, and

121
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,040
What's interesting is I'm not even ranked number one. I'm ranked one two

122
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,400
I'm ranked number six. Okay. Here's my website. I'm ranked number six website doesn't look that great

123
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,600
I've made over $20,000 here. Okay

124
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,520
incredible, okay that this blows me away my

125
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,560
What's even more fascinating is my GMB. I do have a GMB. It's verified for whatever reason

126
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,440
We just can't seem to put it in the maps. It kind of you know ebbs and flows, but we're still making money

127
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,080
We're making a thousand dollars plus per month for the last couple years. So I'm not complaining

128
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,720
okay, another one that I mentioned as a good example was concrete and

129
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:31,040
We have you know made a good chunk of change in this niche as well. So st. George concrete st. George concrete

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,400
And here you have it. Okay this outside same format. We did get some nice photos taken and

131
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,680
That's it. So those are just a couple of examples. I love concrete. I love spray foam insulation

132
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,680
I love tree service as I mentioned and

133
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,400
You don't need to overthink this guys

134
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,640
What I want you to do is in this module and actually before you move on to the next lesson

135
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,200
I need you to pick a

136
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,720
Niche, okay, and I don't want you to overthink it and I don't want you to spend a week on this

137
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,360
I don't even want you to spend a day on this and I'm gonna tell you right now if you're somebody that's like

138
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,680
Analysis paralysis you're gonna hesitate you're gonna overthink it

139
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm gonna just go ahead and tell you pick concrete pick concrete right now pick that niche because it's amazing. It works

140
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,080
I've made tons and tons and tons of money and think about it every city

141
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,560
I don't care where you grew up what village I grew up in what I would consider a village

142
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,200
It's still there was still concrete that people needed concrete. We had we lived on a you know, whatever slab

143
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,320
We had a concrete driveway concrete sidewalk. Everybody needs concrete

144
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,000
So if you're hesitating and you don't know and like oh my gosh, what niche should I use?

145
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,160
What should I go into first do concrete?
