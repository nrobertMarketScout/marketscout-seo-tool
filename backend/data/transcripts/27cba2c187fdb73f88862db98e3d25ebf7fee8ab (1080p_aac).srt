1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,720
What I hold in my hands right here is the perfect prospecting script and before we jump

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,480
into this because I want to talk about the breakdown I want to talk about the overview

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,560
of this script which we're going to be using but before we talk about that I want to tell

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,900
you how I came up with this script.

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,340
This is not something that I googled this is not something that was a swipe this is

6
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,820
not something that somebody gave me.

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:40,860
This right here that I hold in my hands is the product of me knocking thousands not hundreds

8
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:47,980
not tens thousands of doors door to door to door making thousands of prospecting calls

9
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:53,620
doing at this point I probably haven't made a thousand zoom closes at this point but we're

10
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,820
going to be there soon.

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,820
A lot okay this comes from experience this is not something that somebody gave me okay

12
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,880
so I want to tell you when I give you something I make sure it works first and I make sure

13
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,480
it works thousands of times so what I did is I took my knowledge of knocking on door

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,420
after door after door after making prospecting call after prospecting call after prospecting

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,860
call what worked what didn't work I put it into a document and that is the perfect the

16
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,980
perfect prospecting script okay so I want to give you the breakdown really quick it's

17
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,220
a really really simple I want to give you the outline of what it is then we're going

18
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,340
to jump into each individual step and I'm going to give you an actual example okay so

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,460
it's a really really easy process okay this this script is a really really easy four step

20
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:45,220
process with one at the end I guess you could consider a step but I want to go over those

21
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,380
steps really really quickly okay so here's what it is is we're going to it's four things

22
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:56,500
made up of four things number one is who you are and it's a pattern interrupt okay so these

23
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,340
are things that are going to happen during the prospecting script okay during the hook

24
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,460
who you are slash pattern interrupt and I'm going to explain this okay number two is what

25
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,100
you're doing why you're calling guys you need to give them a damn good reason why you're calling

26
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,140
okay you need to give them a damn good reason why you're calling them and interrupting their

27
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:23,700
day step three the deal what's in it for you and what's in it for them okay meaning what's

28
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,660
the win-win and by the way most people most salespeople to get this wrong and they focus

29
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,380
so much on what's in it for them hey you get this you get this you get this and they forget to tell

30
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,340
the business owner hey just so you know I'm gonna make money and a lot of it okay they're so scared

31
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,620
to do that and they forget to tell the business owner that the only thing the business owner is

32
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,900
thinking is what's the catch they like it they're in they're interested but they're thinking there's

33
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,660
got to be a catch there's got to be a catch he keeps telling me good good good good good what's

34
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:57,140
what's his motive okay so don't forget this part so what the deal so step three what is the deal

35
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,060
okay what's in it for them and what's in it for you and I would say it's more important to focus

36
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,980
on what's in it for you because they can clearly see what's in it for them step four is transition

37
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,740
and one thing that's going to really really help you guys in these calls specifically the the hook

38
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:19,140
process is your transitions okay there's times to pause there's times not to pause and we're

39
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,860
gonna work a lot on our transitions and once we deliver our pitch how we can seamlessly transition

40
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,780
okay so when I was doing door-to-door sales we would deliver the pitch and our transition had

41
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:36,340
to be fire if we didn't transition well slam door okay same exact thing you guys don't transition

42
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,620
well you're gonna get hung up on okay and then lastly we're gonna talk about the pullback which

43
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:49,300
is we're gonna talk about what that is when to use it how often to use it it's an actual secret

44
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:56,180
weapon so the overview guys just to recap one more time is this who you are slash pattern interrupt

45
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,540
okay number two what you're doing damn good reason why you're calling them number three

46
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,580
what is the deal okay what's in it for them what's in it for you step four transition and we're also

47
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,860
gonna talk about the pullback that is what makes up the perfect prospecting script guys and I do

48
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,340
want to share this there are people that have come through this program already that looked me in the

49
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,500
eye and said nick I am terrified of the phone you have no idea and I said oh I get it man I get it

50
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,220
no no you don't get it I won't even answer the the leads like this scares me this little piece

51
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,620
of metal piece of plastic it scares me I'm terrified and I've watched those same people

52
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,940
take this script take some hot leads that were coming in call a list of people who are already

53
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,540
sold on the product and turn it into thousands upon thousands of dollars per month so if you're

54
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,860
somebody that's sitting there going oh my gosh nick I'm scared welcome to the club okay everybody

55
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,180
is but when you have the script when you have the right list and you got hot leads it's a total

56
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:01,780
game changer let's go in
