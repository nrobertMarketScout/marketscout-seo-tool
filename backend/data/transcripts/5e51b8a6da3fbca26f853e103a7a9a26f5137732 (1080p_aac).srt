1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Kind of off topic, but how many times will you call back a lead to get info before you

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,320
just say F it and move on?

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,920
I left two voicemails to a lead.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,360
I call seven times.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
Seven is my magic number.

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,560
I have my Dylan telling, hey, after seven times, we can go ahead and assume this person

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,920
is not going to answer.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,120
But when I call, just so you know, Chris, one call for me is I call, goes to voicemail,

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,880
I call again, I shoot a text and I leave a voicemail.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,880
That's one call.

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,880
I do that seven times.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,120
If after seven times, I move on.

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,080
I mark it as a bad lead.

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,080
Seven is the magic number.

15
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,080
I don't even know why.

16
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
I just came up with that.

17
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,080
So you could do whatever.

18
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,100
I do seven.
