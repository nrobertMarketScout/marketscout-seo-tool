I warren how important is the keyword difficulty value?

00:05.320 --> 00:11.040
I don't pay attention to that what I look at bro is and if you're talking about like on some of these tools like

00:11.040 --> 00:13.040
Keyword difficulty blah blah blah

00:13.040 --> 00:18.480
I would pay attention to how it is compared to other projects, but I'm looking at the CPC

00:19.080 --> 00:23.960
And I'm looking at the due diligence sheet as a whole because if I'm going into tree service

00:23.960 --> 00:25.960
I'm trying to rank for tree removal

00:26.840 --> 00:30.080
Tree service tree cutting tree trimming stump removal

00:30.080 --> 00:36.640
I'm trying to rank for all those and so just because one of those is really difficult according to the tool

00:37.000 --> 00:42.080
Doesn't mean that all of them are difficult and I'm looking at it as a whole and so I don't really pay attention

00:42.080 --> 00:45.960
I think it would be valuable to maybe look and see how they compare but keep in mind the tools

00:46.200 --> 00:48.720
The tools are wrong. It's only about comparisons
