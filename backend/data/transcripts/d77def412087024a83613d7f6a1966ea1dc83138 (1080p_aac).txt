What's the trial for clients? B, I saw you make a trial deal for a thousand bucks a month. Yeah,
so the trial is just the first contract. We just call it that because the clients like it,
but the trial is just the deal. So, hey, Mr. Business Owner. So basically what we like to do,
our Mr. Business Owner, is we start off with a 12-month trial or a six-month trial, right? Or if
you have to, a three-month trial. It's a contract. It's the same thing, but they like the sound of
it because then they don't feel like it's like this long-term thing. So we just term it. We just
coin it like trial, but it's not. It's the deal. Okay.
