00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Guys, welcome to module three, content is king.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,360
And before we get going, I just want to talk about why content is the way that we win.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,660
This is how we win is through content, okay?

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,080
And if you guys remember back to one of the videos I covered in module one of the technical

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,620
training, a part two of this whole digital landlords program, is content is one of the

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,960
big three things.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,140
Content is one of the pieces of the 80-20 rule.

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,240
You can do a lot of things wrong, and if you do a couple of them right, you're going to

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
win.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,040
And so the reason why content is so important, as I mentioned, if you think about it, Google

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,560
does not have millions of people that are just looking at websites and getting together

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,160
and saying, this one should rank, this one shouldn't, this one should, this one shouldn't.

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,480
They have an algorithm and they have bots that crawl, they crawl the websites.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,360
And these bots, they can't see, they can read text.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,360
And so it's interesting, people, like if you think about it, the only way Google can know

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,840
what your website is about is by what is on your website, what kind of text is on your

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
website.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,480
And you go look at most of these websites for Tony, the tree care guy, or Jack, the

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,760
concrete guy, and they don't have any content.

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,360
They have 20 words, 30 words, 40 words, they don't know that it's important.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,080
And on top of that, they don't want to do it because writing content is hard.

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,160
Writing content actually takes work.

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,000
Writing content requires you to use your head.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,200
So the number one thing is why it's important and why this is how we're going to win is

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,200
because it is one of the big three things that matter with ranking.

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
That's number one.

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,240
Number two, other companies, other, especially these local business owners, they're not willing

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,680
to do it and they're not doing it.

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,960
If you guys have done your due diligence properly, going all the way back to looking for layups

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,180
in part one of Digital Landlords, you will notice that the people that you're competing

31
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,480
against are not big national companies.

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,440
These are little teeny mom and pop shops.

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,600
They probably went to GoDaddy, set up a little website, or went to WIC, set up a little website,

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,400
or paid their needs so that if you set up a little website, these guys are not going

35
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,860
to be hard to beat, but we have to beat them with content because if they have an old domain,

36
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,040
we can't beat that.

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
We can't fight it.

38
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,000
We can't fake our domain size or our domain age, sorry.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,240
So content is super, super important because of those facts.

40
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,400
So guys, this is super important.

41
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,160
Instead of just moaning and groaning and saying, oh my gosh, I got to write the content, look

42
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,800
at it as this is how we're going to win.

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,480
And if we can get good at content, if we can get obsessed with content and getting good

44
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,040
at it and good enough that then we can outsource it and we can have our outsourcers and our

45
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,960
team and our virtual assistants write our content for us, this is how we're going to

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
win.

47
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,240
If we do the content correctly, we can avoid a lot of other stuff.

48
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,040
We can rank much more quickly.

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,680
We can avoid doing a lot of backlinks.

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,200
We can avoid a lot of things, okay?

51
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,680
And it's just like if you use the example of Kobe Bryant, right, I always talk about

52
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
Kobe.

53
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,280
Kobe was obsessed with the little things.

54
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,000
He was obsessed with the things that other players wouldn't get obsessed with.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,480
He was obsessed with the angle he came off of the screen.

56
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,300
He was obsessed with the crossover.

57
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,720
He was obsessed with how he came out of a double team.

58
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,360
Equally, if we want to get to that level, if we want to grow our businesses and make

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,240
these more than just making a couple bucks here or a couple bucks there, we need to get

60
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
obsessed with these things.

61
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,720
And this is one of those things, if you take the time to learn it and you take the time

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,720
to get good at it, it will pay dividends for every single project.

63
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
Let's keep going.
