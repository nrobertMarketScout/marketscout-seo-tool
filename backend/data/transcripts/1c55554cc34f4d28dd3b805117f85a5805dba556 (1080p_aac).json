I would start with five questions and I would literally go through and I'd start writing and every time I would do a keyword, I'd make a check mark or a strike and I would manually check and make sure I included as many keywords as possible, but didn't overuse it. And then when I got the dual screen, I would have the keywords over here and the document over here and I would do the exact same thing, except it was digitally.
