1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,920
Okay, guys, I don't think this guy needs an introduction, but this is Mike V, like, to

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,480
be honest, I just have, I have nine questions for you, dude.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,880
And Mike V is at $40,000 a month, and he just posted his Stripe screenshot in I think it

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,760
was the free group, which I really appreciated.

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,880
And because I know sometimes it's scary to share, I know sometimes you think, dude, what

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,880
are people going to say?

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,640
What are they, you know, it's not even what they think, but what are they going to say?

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,640
And if you're not the braggy type, then maybe they're going to think I'm like that.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,920
And so I do appreciate it because I think you'd be surprised how much people really

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,640
get inspired by those posts, way more people get inspired than get jealous.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,180
And the people that get jealous are going to just blame the program or me or everything

12
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,000
else and quit anyway.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So it doesn't matter.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,520
But Mike V is at $40,000 USD per month.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:07,560
And I just want to ask him questions personally about how he got there, what he's doing.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,160
And like, these aren't to fill time.

17
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,680
These are like genuine questions.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,640
So I just want to basically jump right in.

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,320
Aaron, I'm going to let you ask any questions you have, I'm going to let you also, if you

20
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,780
guys have questions, start dropping them in the comments, I'm going to have Aaron kind

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,440
of moderate when there are questions that when we get to the end.

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,940
So Mike V, in 42 minutes, I'm going to let you off the stream.

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,120
If you can give us 42 minutes, I would appreciate that.

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,440
And we're just going to get through as much as we can.

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
Is that cool?

26
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
100%.

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
Beautiful.

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,440
First and foremost, you guys need to follow Mike V on his Instagram page.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,480
He has two.

30
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,000
And he just followed me on his like business one.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,600
He has some really amazing content ideas.

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,740
And by the way, I just saw the most awesome post you made where someone is massaging your

33
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,740
head while you were working and you had someone who touched your feet and like he based it

34
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,420
like six.

35
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,740
I don't even know what what nationality these girls were, but you just look like a king,

36
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,740
dude.

37
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,660
Yeah, it's it's one of the hacks is when you when you're printing, when you make money,

38
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,220
you got the massage, you get a foot massage, you get someone doing your head and you're

39
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,860
just sitting there, you know, checking strike balances, doing SEO makes for a good experience.

40
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,100
Dude, if you're not checking SEO and eating like some type of exotic fruit, you're you're

41
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,620
really not living, you know.

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,100
For sure.

43
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,580
That's a good time over here in Thailand for sure.

44
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,900
But yeah, I think things have moved pretty quick this year.

45
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,060
It's been good.

46
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,580
What's your Instagram, bro?

47
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,540
I want to guys, I'm serious.

48
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,940
You guys should get inspired by what this guy is doing.

49
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,820
And yeah, what's your Instagram, your personal or that one or whatever one?

50
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,540
People should follow you should check out what you're doing because this guy is making

51
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,180
moves and he's just getting started.

52
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,580
So what is it?

53
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,500
And then I'll have or I can even have Aaron go go to Instagram, find Mike V and just share

54
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,180
share his link.

55
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,980
I'll do that for you.

56
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,140
Oh, he already did it.

57
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,620
Marcus, we understand the chat.

58
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,180
There you go.

59
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,300
Beautiful.

60
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,900
Beautiful.

61
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,700
OK, you can drop me a photo there to see what I'm up to.

62
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,540
And I've also got a link to my business profile and my personal one.

63
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,860
That's OK.

64
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,020
Awesome.

65
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,060
So let's just let's just dive into this.

66
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,020
We've already interviewed you before, so I'm not going to backpedal too much.

67
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,820
But just real quick, tell us when you started and where you're living right now.

68
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,340
When I started digital landlords.

69
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,700
Yeah, when you started the program, I know that you had a little bit of digital

70
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,060
marketing experience. Yeah.

71
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,260
Just when did you start in here?

72
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,220
I started in digital landlords about 26 months ago and I'm currently in in Thailand.

73
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:56,620
Can you guys still see me?

74
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,980
Yeah, you're back. Can you hear me?

75
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,980
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,060
That we cut out for a second.

77
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,980
OK, we're good. OK, I heard 20.

78
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,140
You said 26 months.

79
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,620
Yeah, 26 months in digital landlords.

80
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,060
At that time, I was back home in my corporate job and we're in Bangkok now.

81
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,900
OK, beautiful.

82
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,420
So that's just to give a little bit of a of a backdrop.

83
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,220
So basically a little bit over two years.

84
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,980
So here's the first question.

85
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,380
Go ahead, go ahead.

86
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,020
Yeah, two two years in digital landlords.

87
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,580
OK. That's crazy, bro.

88
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,940
I was in programs for four years and I was barely scratching 8000 a month.

89
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,100
So I admire people like you, Ryan Dalton, like that.

90
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,900
You guys are able to pick this up so quickly.

91
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,580
I'm the type of person that just takes a long time to learn stuff.

92
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,940
So I love it, dude.

93
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,820
OK, so remind me, because I don't remember when we talked last time,

94
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:04,260
did this did it click for you right away or did it take you some time?

95
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,820
I know I do remember you getting to 10K relatively quickly,

96
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,860
but like, did that very first deal?

97
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,060
And I'm saying that for the people that just started, like, did it click quickly?

98
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,180
And if so, why do you think that was?

99
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:25,540
It clicked pretty quickly compared to what I was doing for the previous four years,

100
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,180
because I was trying to figure out how to make money online for four years.

101
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,540
And I was making a thousand dollars a month for four years.

102
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,660
And then I joined the program and I just worked as hard as I could.

103
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,820
And it clicked pretty quick.

104
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,860
I mean, it was pretty tough up until the first deal.

105
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,180
Just trying to believe in it and, you know, having the faith and everything.

106
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,620
But I just, you know, read the book, the Thinking Grow Rich book.

107
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,140
And, you know, once that first deal got over the line,

108
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,020
it was pretty smooth sailing from there.

109
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,860
Like you said, you just need to repeat it, you know, eight more times

110
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,660
or 40 more times or whatever you want.

111
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,620
Why? How long did it take you to get your first deal?

112
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,580
I think it was four or five weeks.

113
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,740
OK, that's maybe six.

114
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,780
I think five.

115
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,380
That's good.

116
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,620
But it's not like, you know, you've got some guys like a week or two weeks.

117
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,380
Like, that's good.

118
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,940
But it's not like overly like that's doable.

119
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,900
It's repeatable for anyone that gets in.

120
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,580
Like, you know what I mean?

121
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,700
Like anybody could come in and get a deal in five, six weeks.

122
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,500
So that this is what I'm trying to figure out.

123
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,180
And the reason I'm having you on, dude, is like,

124
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,420
I'm trying to figure out why it is that some people are so successful.

125
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,300
And why some people

126
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,060
just want to like they it's it's it's the same material.

127
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,780
It's the same program.

128
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,900
It's the same coaching calls.

129
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,500
It's the it's usually the same niches.

130
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,300
But you're at 40K and there's people at zero that are blaming everybody else.

131
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,900
Why do you think there's people out there that have been in for 90 days,

132
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,340
you know, six months and have no deals?

133
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,060
I think they might be comfortable, you know, not kind of want it bad enough.

134
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,460
I remember when I joined, I was already going to quit my job

135
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,140
and and leave the country and, you know, pursue my dreams.

136
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,820
So my back was against the wall.

137
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,180
So I don't really have a choice but to make it happen.

138
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,660
And I knew I knew really deeply what I actually wanted,

139
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,140
like from digital landlords, I knew that it was going to be the avenue

140
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,260
to live the life that I have now.

141
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,860
So I think just understanding exactly why

142
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,260
they'll get you through like the trench phase,

143
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,740
because there's a trench phase to every type of business model

144
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,900
and everything you do, like whether it's learning to ride a bike, close deals.

145
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,580
You have to get through that trench phase.

146
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,780
And that's basically impossible

147
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,300
unless you have like a

148
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,900
why and perhaps like forcing yourself to do it.

149
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,860
And if I wasn't going to quit my job, I probably wouldn't have worked as hard

150
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,060
because I knew, you know, I've still got my my paycheck coming in.

151
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,820
So you don't have an element of risk, I think, to go.

152
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,020
So how do people that because I do know what you're saying.

153
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,780
And essentially what how I interpret that is like when people are

154
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,140
I swear comfort is the scariest thing ever.

155
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,540
Right. Because when you're comfortable, you don't want to do

156
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,860
you don't want to move because it's like you're just

157
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,740
it's like being in your freaking bed and it's cold outside.

158
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,380
Like you're just you're you're you're just content.

159
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,940
You're just laying in those sheets and it feels so good.

160
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,740
But you know, you're going to feel regret and you know,

161
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,660
you're going to feel these things.

162
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,940
But it's so hard to get out because you're comfortable.

163
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,420
So how do you like?

164
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,060
You know, I'm kind of like you, bro, I think, because for me,

165
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,380
that sounds like you had already made up your mind

166
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,220
that you're going to quit your job.

167
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,940
You're going to go pursue your dreams.

168
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,380
That's just what was going to happen.

169
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,380
And so you're going to force yourself to make it happen

170
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,460
because you're going to make yourself uncomfortable.

171
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,860
What do other people do, bro, that aren't that type,

172
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,620
that they're not the type that's going to go quick

173
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,140
because I did that same kind of a thing.

174
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,820
I just kind of quit what I was doing before.

175
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,180
And I'm like, well, I have to figure this out.

176
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,420
So but maybe they're not everyone's that type.

177
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,100
That terrifies people.

178
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,380
Do you think there's a way that people that aren't that type,

179
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,820
that are comfortable right now in a job, in whatever,

180
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,460
that they can force that discomfort without, like, completely just,

181
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,540
you know, throwing caution to the wind?

182
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,140
Yeah. You know what I mean?

183
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,300
Yeah, for sure.

184
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
I don't recommend everyone does the same approach I did,

185
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,420
you know, especially if you've got family or something like that

186
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,140
or other commitments.

187
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,100
But I mean, I'm teaching a couple of people,

188
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,740
local business, lead generation myself.

189
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,540
Some of them are in fairly comfortable positions,

190
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,260
like they might have other income at the moment.

191
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,580
And I think what works for those people

192
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,580
is kind of setting goals for yourself each week

193
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,020
and having, like, a bit of a timeline to make your first,

194
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,340
you know, $2,000 to $5,000.

195
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,220
And then once you break that down into, like, weekly KPIs

196
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,500
or things that you need to tick off,

197
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,020
you know, at the end of the week and say,

198
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,700
hey, did I do it or did I not do it?

199
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,460
And I think it just comes down to discipline

200
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,260
as well as a bit of that mindset training as well.

201
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,980
And I'm sure you're still telling people

202
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,260
to read that Think and Grow Rich book.

203
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,820
So I think a combination of, yeah, your mindset

204
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,340
and having the discipline with, like, a set goal,

205
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,860
that's what I'd recommend

206
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,540
instead of just throwing caution to the wind, perhaps.

207
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,580
Okay. I'm writing notes, dude.

208
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,500
And I'm not, again, I hope you can tell,

209
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,700
I have all these questions,

210
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,500
but I'm genuinely, like, having this conversation

211
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,300
like we're just sitting there having the conversation

212
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,700
because I would love, I'm trying to extract

213
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,700
out of your brain how we can,

214
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,660
and sometimes it's hard because for me,

215
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,300
I just do it a lot of times.

216
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,220
And so sometimes it's hard for me to relate to other people

217
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,420
because I've always thrown caution to the wind, dude.

218
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,740
When I got my first sales job,

219
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,620
it was door to door, 100% commission,

220
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,580
with a baby on the way, I was recently married,

221
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,020
I had no money coming in and I was like, yeah, sign me up.

222
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,860
I can make, what's the potential?

223
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,740
What's the best guy?

224
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,220
What was the best guy in the company last year?

225
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,060
They said 90 grand.

226
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,940
Okay, awesome.

227
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,660
So that's the, I can make at least 90 grand.

228
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,540
Okay, sign me up.

229
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,300
I know I'm as good as that guy.

230
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,220
And that's just how I think.

231
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,500
And I quit my job and we moved across the country

232
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,540
and I made it work.

233
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,020
When I started this business, I bought a program

234
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,060
and I stopped doing that job to do this.

235
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,860
And I just, sometimes I find it hard to relate

236
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,980
and I don't know how to tell people

237
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,740
to make themselves uncomfortable because they just,

238
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,140
they're just gonna die in their discomfort, I feel like.

239
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,540
Aaron, do you have anything you wanna add on this?

240
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,780
Because Aaron is, dude,

241
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,940
this is one of the sharpest kids I've ever met.

242
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,300
Very persistent, by the way.

243
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,260
One of these days we're gonna go live

244
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,260
on how persistent this guy is.

245
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,220
Aaron, anything you wanna add on this?

246
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,100
No, I mean, I think you're right on, Mike.

247
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,340
It seems like we always do the thing we desire most

248
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,740
in the moment and just we live life

249
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,340
generally choosing comfort.

250
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,100
Yeah.

251
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,580
Yeah, yeah.

252
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,100
And- Yeah, for sure.

253
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,980
And we trade temporary comfort for future regret,

254
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,260
which is scary.

255
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,300
I don't know.

256
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,620
I think I'd add on that,

257
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,340
just thinking about how to put early,

258
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,660
putting yourself in financial stress

259
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,580
or family stress or whatever is,

260
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,140
just having a true understanding

261
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,300
of the shortness of life.

262
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,500
And I was reading a lot of stock philosophy

263
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,860
leading up to joining the group

264
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,620
and also going home with the travel side

265
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,620
and actually kind of meditating on that a bit

266
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,300
and just pondering the short life

267
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,300
can motivate you in a way of, for me is like,

268
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,740
there's so much to explore in this world.

269
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,060
There's so many places to travel to.

270
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,220
There's so much to experience.

271
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,660
And you can't really appreciate that

272
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,460
until you kind of understand that,

273
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,820
hey, we only really have 80 years here.

274
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,380
So that's another way to kind of motivate yourself

275
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,220
to work harder.

276
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,140
Yeah.

277
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,260
This is a personal question.

278
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,460
You said you would already made up your mind

279
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,860
to quit your job and chase your dreams, right?

280
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,180
Yeah.

281
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,060
What are your dreams?

282
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,340
What is it that you,

283
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,020
because I think people are either motivated

284
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,460
by they're running away from something they're scared of

285
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,420
or they're running towards something that they want.

286
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,180
What are your dreams that you wanted to quit your job

287
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,060
and use this to achieve?

288
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,660
I think you should do it now,

289
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,820
but training Muay Thai, waking up whenever I want.

290
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,780
I ride my scooter through the mountains

291
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,460
to the beach every day.

292
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,780
Got a pool villa with a nice blue pool in it.

293
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,660
I'm hanging out with other guys doing the same thing.

294
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,660
Now I don't have to go to my corporate office

295
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,980
and like sacrifice my authenticity.

296
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,580
You know, I don't have to live in anyone else's shadow

297
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,860
and do stuff that's inauthentic,

298
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,380
which I think can just impact the quality of your life.

299
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,780
When you have to go to a job that you don't like

300
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,500
and supplicate to a boss, like it chips away your soul.

301
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,780
And I'm living my dreams now, so I'm happy as.

302
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,620
That's sick, dude.

303
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,660
So you're living in Thailand.

304
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,660
You basically every day you wake up when you want

305
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,500
and then you, how many times a week are you going

306
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,900
to the beach through the mountains on a scooter?

307
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,820
Every day I drive into Starbucks,

308
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,300
get a coffee, hang out with some friends

309
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,940
and I still work extremely hard.

310
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,500
I think last month I worked 30 days straight,

311
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,060
just because I was so excited about the business

312
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,060
and I had a lot of momentum going.

313
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,260
That's crazy, bro.

314
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,540
I love stories like that.

315
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,420
Stories like yours, they are inspiring

316
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,460
because it's like you are literally,

317
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,980
it's like you're like literally living

318
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,140
the Tim Ferriss 40 hour work week,

319
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,180
not necessarily that's how much you work,

320
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,260
but like just the, you're doing, is it called Muay Thai?

321
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,420
Yeah, Muay Thai, yeah.

322
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,260
I love it, bro.

323
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,060
Had my first fight recently, which was fun.

324
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,180
Yeah, tell us about that.

325
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,340
How did you do, bro?

326
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,940
Yeah, good, it was, I mean, I've always done Muay Thai,

327
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,220
I've always liked combat sports

328
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,580
and I was like, hey, I've got free time now.

329
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,380
Like, yeah, so I signed up for a fight, super nervous,

330
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,140
but I was like, hey, let's, you know, the fight's signed,

331
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,660
we've got to train hard now, we've got to prepare for war

332
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,060
and, you know, because I had digital landlords,

333
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,620
I had all my money coming in,

334
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,300
I was able to train twice a day,

335
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,860
I was working like an hour or two,

336
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,300
just keeping the lights on and had the fight,

337
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,500
went well, no injuries and got the win.

338
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,740
So that was an awesome moment this year as well.

339
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,820
That's crazy, I love that, dude.

340
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,820
Yeah, there was a student that we had on,

341
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,860
his name is, I think it's Jordan,

342
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,100
and I remember something that he said,

343
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,420
we were talking about, he was talking about

344
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,100
some of the stuff he wants to do with his son and stuff

345
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,460
and he was talking about this mountain

346
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,300
that he wants to climb

347
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,700
and he said something that always stuck with me,

348
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,740
he's like, imagine like living your whole life

349
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,180
and not having, not climbing that mountain

350
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,060
and he named this specific mountain

351
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,380
and I can't remember what mountain it was,

352
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,500
but like that was an important mountain for him.

353
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,460
And it's just insane that like,

354
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,300
there's so many things to do,

355
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,060
so many places to see,

356
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,340
so many like problems to solve,

357
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,500
people to meet, experiences to have,

358
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,300
foods to taste, cultures to experience

359
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,260
and all it is is on the other side

360
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,740
of like just doing the freaking boring work

361
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,660
of what we have in front of us.

362
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,300
It's, I mean, you're an example of it, bro.

363
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,300
What like, what was your life like 27 months ago?

364
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,300
The trenches, I was working 40 hours a week.

365
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,420
I was working two hours after work on the business,

366
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,620
on the side business, on the hobby, you know, at the time.

367
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,820
I was training an hour a day in the gym,

368
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,260
so I was flat out, I only had Sundays off just to recover

369
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,540
and then we'd be straight back in the trenches

370
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,580
and like those are the points I look back on

371
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,580
and kind of like revere and like whole daily,

372
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,700
like sitting at the desk,

373
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,580
like looking out the window and like,

374
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,340
sitting at the desk and looking out the window,

375
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,340
just like dreaming of just an absolute trenches

376
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,780
but like enjoying it, like, you know,

377
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,940
knowing that it was gonna work out

378
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,140
because all of the work that,

379
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,460
all of the mindset stuff and think and grow rich,

380
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,180
that's such a massive part of it.

381
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,940
And especially it is hard at the start

382
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,140
when you don't have that mindset

383
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,420
or you don't have other people around you who are doing it.

384
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,020
But I think just listen to your advice

385
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,980
and jumping on the live calls and just like embracing it.

386
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,100
Look at there in the end.

387
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,100
I think going back to what we talked about

388
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,420
with like discomfort,

389
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,340
you know, one way I've found to make yourself uncomfortable

390
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:51,340
is purposely putting yourself around people

391
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,460
that are playing at such a higher level than you.

392
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,820
That you will feel uncomfortable

393
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,820
because you know, you're gonna see that like

394
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,940
for them to go and buy a brand new Range Rover

395
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,860
or a brand new G wagon tomorrow cash is an afterthought

396
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,860
or to book a charter, a jet to go down to Mexico

397
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,780
for three days and spend 20 grand is just something

398
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,940
that you decide to do over a drink one night.

399
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,100
And you're like, oh my gosh,

400
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,700
if I'm gonna keep being friends with these people,

401
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,860
I gotta start being like playing a different game

402
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,220
because if I get invited to these things,

403
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,740
I can't be the guy that's like,

404
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,100
dude, what's the price of the jet?

405
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,940
You know what I mean?

406
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,340
So I think one thing that we can do

407
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,340
to force that discomfort is get around people

408
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,140
at a higher level of very, a much higher level than us.

409
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,620
And it makes us, it kind of makes us realize

410
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,620
just how small we're playing compared to other people.

411
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,020
Do you know what I'm saying?

412
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,940
Yeah, a hundred percent.

413
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,420
I mean, eight to 10 weeks after joining your landlords,

414
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,060
I was on around 10K a month.

415
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,540
And I was cruising on about 10K a month for about a year,

416
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,340
like traveling around a bit.

417
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,900
And it got pretty lonely just traveling by yourself.

418
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,340
So I joined like a bit of a network

419
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,500
of like other entrepreneurs.

420
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,100
And like Nick says, like a lot of them

421
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,860
were making some great money,

422
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,020
like much more than myself.

423
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,020
And just being around them,

424
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,940
like pulling you up to a higher level,

425
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,020
or like you're absorbing the mindsets that they have,

426
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,540
like you're thinking about what they're doing.

427
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,860
And that was actually a key part

428
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,500
because at the start of this year

429
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,620
is when I joined that group,

430
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,060
when I was on 10K and then fast forward,

431
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,420
nine months later, we're on 40,000.

432
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,340
So I attribute most of this year's success

433
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,100
to almost all of it, to that group of people.

434
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,860
And even the converse, and I agree, bro.

435
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,300
And even the conversations,

436
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,060
the way that they talk about things,

437
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,060
like I've recently kind of like formed this relationship

438
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,220
with this guy and it's like, just the,

439
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:18,220
it's like casually like, oh, I'm gonna buy a house.

440
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,900
This guy in Dubai, you know, I think I'm gonna,

441
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,700
he has, I don't know,

442
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,980
I think it's like 14 places here in Dubai.

443
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,860
And he just wanted to buy a villa.

444
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,020
And he wanted to buy a villa.

445
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,620
And there wasn't a budget.

446
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,660
It was just what's the villa that we want.

447
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,500
And I started like to dig in a little bit.

448
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,940
And it was like, and he ended up getting one.

449
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,740
And it was like, it was like 6 million or 7 million.

450
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,100
It was just cash, no loan, no nothing.

451
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,540
And you're like, okay, that's cool, man.

452
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,540
I like, it's just, it's the game is levels.

453
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,260
And you just start going, oh my gosh,

454
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,860
this guy's so much more,

455
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,260
he's doing so much more than me financially.

456
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,100
I gotta keep up.

457
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,140
So anyway, for those of you that are sitting there

458
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,980
going, I feel comfortable.

459
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,020
And I don't know what to do

460
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,380
because I'm making $15,000 a month.

461
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,380
Guys, that is a lot compared to, you know,

462
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,020
your brother that works at Starbucks.

463
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,940
That's great.

464
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,100
But like 15,000 a month,

465
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,020
I don't know how people live on 15,000 a month

466
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,220
that have a family.

467
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,380
And I don't mean that being at all condescending.

468
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,540
I'm genuinely saying like when you look at gas

469
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,740
and if you have a pool and you're paying to heat the pool

470
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,620
and the pool guy and the vacation,

471
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,260
I mean, dude, you can't live on 15.

472
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,620
I don't know how you live on 15 grand.

473
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,100
And I know people that are living on like four grand.

474
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,660
So those of you that are uncomfortable,

475
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,300
one thing that you could try

476
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,900
is getting around other people

477
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,500
than your same friends that you go and, you know,

478
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,140
do, you know, whatever drink on,

479
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,820
at the bowling alley on a Wednesday, whatever.

480
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,460
So, okay, two more questions for me,

481
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,260
three more questions.

482
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,420
And then I wanna go to Q&A.

483
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,860
Mike, these are just random.

484
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,620
And I wanna know this because I swear to you,

485
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,460
I'm trying to like,

486
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,620
I'm asking everybody these questions.

487
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,460
And so they're really kind of out there,

488
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,860
but I'm just, I'm curious.

489
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,020
And there's no wrong answer.

490
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,060
There's no right answer.

491
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,820
But it just, I'm gonna keep asking these questions

492
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,300
because I'm trying to find commonalities.

493
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,300
But are you a spiritual and or religious person

494
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,020
or would you consider yourself neither of those things?

495
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,500
Yeah, definitely.

496
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,300
And open to religion.

497
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,620
I think agnostic's the word.

498
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,620
Definitely believe in some sort of high purpose

499
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,620
or something, you know,

500
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,700
that we can't quite perceive in the third dimension,

501
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,700
whatever that means.

502
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,820
Okay, I just, I'm completely just curious.

503
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,420
Yeah, there's no, it's just, I'm observing,

504
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,140
I'm looking at other things because, you know,

505
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,660
you see things, you're like, oh yeah,

506
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,180
all the people I know that are successful,

507
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,460
they do these, but these are things that are like,

508
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,340
I'm just curious.

509
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,020
Other thing I'm curious about is,

510
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:26,020
do you, are you actively involved with your time

511
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,580
or money in any kind of like a charity at this point,

512
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,980
or is it something that you plan on doing in the future

513
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,820
or is it just like not something on your radar

514
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,020
that doesn't make you a good or bad person?

515
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,940
I'm just curious.

516
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,940
I don't have any charities,

517
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,020
but I always tip like very, very heavily.

518
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,540
Excuse me.

519
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,940
You know, especially at the villa,

520
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,340
like you've got people cleaning the pool,

521
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,260
people are coming through like plan maintenance,

522
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,340
people come clean and like,

523
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,100
I always tip like, you know, a really good amount.

524
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,940
That's cool.

525
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,580
And that's not only to kind of give back to people

526
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,500
with less opportunity,

527
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,460
but also just building like an abundance mindset

528
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,940
when it comes to money.

529
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,580
And it's funny how it works

530
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,020
is when you start tipping more and like giving more,

531
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,460
you know, deals just landed on your lap,

532
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,100
money is just comes to you.

533
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,100
And yeah, I think that's a charity

534
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,060
in whatever sense it is, it's really good.

535
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,540
You can't be stingy or you can't be scarce with money

536
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,060
because you maintain that reality if it is in your mind.

537
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,900
You know, it's funny.

538
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,420
You guys, I don't know, maybe you do, maybe you don't,

539
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,180
but the guy that does all of our YouTube videos,

540
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,380
he's also a student inside here named Isaac.

541
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,980
He's 21, 22, I think, maybe he's 22, maybe he's 23.

542
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,180
I don't know, he's young.

543
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,420
He taught me something and it pisses me off

544
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,100
that I had to learn this from him

545
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,100
because I always just, I kind of treat him

546
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,060
like little brother, you know, I would kind of rough him up.

547
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,660
But this one day we went to this gym,

548
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,060
we were down in California and we went to this gym,

549
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,580
like we did like a late gym session

550
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,020
because we went to Disneyland and he'd never been

551
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,740
and my family went and I invited him,

552
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,420
went to Disneyland and me and him decided

553
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,820
to go to the gym at like 11.

554
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,580
And he went and bought like a energy drink before the gym

555
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,780
because we were so tired, he bought like a whatever.

556
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,660
And you know, when you buy something

557
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,900
or you go to a restaurant, asks for a tip, right?

558
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,860
He tipped more than the drink.

559
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,620
It was like a $4 drink and he tipped or the same.

560
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,820
It's like five bucks, he tipped five.

561
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,140
And dude, he came over and he was like,

562
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,180
he told me about it, he's like,

563
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,860
you should have seen how happy this guy was.

564
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,780
He was like, thank you so much, bro.

565
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,260
And this kid, I'm like, what?

566
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,300
Why would you tip the, he didn't do anything for you, bro.

567
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,700
Why would you tip on that?

568
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,420
Because I always used to get pissed

569
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,660
when it would be like, you know, do you tip?

570
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,540
And he taught me that he's like,

571
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,420
dude, I always choose the most.

572
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,340
And I'm like, you're stupid, dude.

573
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,100
And I was like, all right, I'm gonna try to do that.

574
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,260
And I swear to you for a long time, I've been doing this.

575
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,740
If I'm on my DoorDash or like in Dubai,

576
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,700
it's called Deliveroo or if I'm at a restaurant,

577
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,980
I always choose the highest amount.

578
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,980
Like if it's like five, seven or 20,

579
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,700
I choose 20 every time.

580
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,860
And I swear sometimes I hesitate cause I'm like,

581
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,940
oh, that's like, especially if it's like $500 bill,

582
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,060
you're like, I just spent an extra whatever, 100 bucks.

583
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,980
I swear to you, there's something about it though,

584
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,700
that if you are, you know, abundant,

585
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,300
then abundance flows to you.

586
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,140
It's crazy.

587
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,220
It's, I don't know.

588
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,020
I don't know how to explain it.

589
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,500
It's like when you go to his tech to the 20 bucks,

590
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,500
for example, like when you go through with it,

591
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
it's, you're basically telling yourself,

592
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,900
I know I'm implausible because I know more money's coming.

593
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,020
And that's, that changes the whole way you operate.

594
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,500
When you're on sales call, it's like you're more relaxed.

595
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,940
When you're doing your due diligence,

596
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,580
you're more motivated.

597
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,740
And just touching with the DoorDash,

598
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,820
on the DoorDash, we have Grab here in Thailand.

599
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,940
And this dude rocked up a couple of days ago,

600
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,380
delivering the morning coffee.

601
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,420
He's like freshly broke his hand.

602
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,580
You know, and he's driving his bike.

603
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,340
He gets off his bike and he hands me the coffee.

604
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,740
And I'm like, whoa, this is a poor fellow right here.

605
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,340
And he's still in the trenches, you know, grinding.

606
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,300
And then he came back another week later.

607
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,620
I tipped him 20 bucks, like the max I could in the app.

608
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,820
Then he came back the next week

609
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,180
and he showed me his doctor's certificate.

610
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,020
And I was like, man,

611
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,300
there's some really unfortunate people,

612
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,300
but this guy's still out here, like, you know,

613
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,100
putting food on his family's table.

614
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,180
It's in the way that, yeah, anyway, it's so true, bro.

615
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,700
So anyway, you guys don't have to do that.

616
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,540
But for me, I found that it's like a big thing.

617
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:52,180
So kind of out there a bit, but it's true.

618
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,540
So, okay, dude, let's get into some Q&A.

619
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,820
I'm gonna ask this last question

620
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,260
and I'm gonna have Aaron kind of like,

621
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:04,260
be the person that kind of coordinates all the Q&A,

622
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,860
so I don't have to look at it.

623
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,020
But the question that I'm having coming into this,

624
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,420
and I'm just gonna ask it to you

625
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,900
because it's the question I'm trying to like,

626
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,100
think of the, I'm thinking about this the entire time

627
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,140
and this is why I wanted you on this call.

628
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:23,140
But like, how can we help students in this program

629
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:27,900
inside of this group replicate your success?

630
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,060
Is it something that we can do,

631
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,100
like my team, me, Aaron, Ashley, Isaac,

632
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,500
and I'm sure it's a combination of both,

633
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,100
and if so, what?

634
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,780
Is it on the students, like how,

635
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,940
dude, what can we, I wish I just knew the answer

636
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,460
and we could do that thing.

637
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,460
I'm trying to extract like how in the world

638
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:59,460
do we get people to have even a quarter of your success

639
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,140
to just go and do it because there's no reason,

640
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:07,140
if Mike's at 40,000 in two years per month, US,

641
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,220
why do you guys, why do some of you not have a deal?

642
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,180
I don't get it, I don't get it.

643
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,260
So Mike, how do we replicate your success, dude?

644
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,140
Yeah, I think everything's, I think everything's there,

645
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,660
like, you know, I did a bit of marketing before I joined

646
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,220
and I was going through the course

647
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,420
with like a beginner's mindset

648
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,900
and just following everything exactly as training suggested

649
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,100
and I think the training's perfect.

650
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,660
You know, you follow it enough times,

651
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,820
you're gonna get deals.

652
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,500
I think a big part of the training

653
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,700
that maybe people neglect in place of the technical stuff

654
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,140
like the SCR and due diligence is just the mindset side,

655
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,900
the think and grow rich book that you recommended

656
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,620
and some of the goal setting, you know,

657
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,020
like how many cold calls are you gonna have to do

658
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,660
to hit your $5,000 a month target

659
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,620
or whatever your target is?

660
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,820
And if you don't have your target,

661
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,260
then you need to set a target.

662
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,660
And when you mentioned Tim Ferriss's for our work week,

663
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,740
the first chapter of that is D for definition,

664
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,540
which is to actually define your ideal life

665
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,820
and you might be surprised at how many deals you need.

666
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,820
You only need, you may only need two,

667
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,220
I only need one or two deals

668
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,260
to live my dream life at the start

669
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,580
because that was the price of three meals, a scooter,

670
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,620
you know, a cheap villa in Thailand.

671
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,700
So that's what I would suggest.

672
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,540
I love that.

673
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,940
And just so everybody knows,

674
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,380
we know that we can make improvements

675
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,620
and Aaron kind of alluded to that at the beginning.

676
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,860
There are some massive, we're gonna be,

677
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,900
by the way, we are in the planning stages of redoing

678
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,180
to version 3.0, the training.

679
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,100
And without giving too much away,

680
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,420
we have some really, really interesting stuff.

681
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,180
So just know that we know that like we can improve.

682
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:01,660
It's not like there's not things that we can do better.

683
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,500
The fact of the matter is though,

684
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,140
that with the exact same training

685
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,180
that is currently available,

686
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,660
Mike has managed to get to $40,000 USD per month

687
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,460
while also fighting and training for a fight,

688
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,700
while also riding his scooter to the beach every day,

689
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,420
while also getting head massages

690
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,140
while he's checking his stride.

691
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,860
Let's not forget about that.

692
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,660
So anyway, bro.

693
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,500
Dude, it's been-

694
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,580
Send the picture for the group.

695
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,900
Yeah, send that picture.

696
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,340
You should post that picture, by the way.

697
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,620
That's an epic.

698
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,220
I saw that on your story and I was like,

699
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,540
I love that story.

700
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,260
That's a really good story you posted.

701
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:45,060
So I wanna get into a little bit of Q&A,

702
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,100
but I do just wanna first before we go in the last 10 minutes,

703
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,140
just thank you for coming on

704
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,980
because I know your time is super valuable.

705
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,860
$40,000 per month, guys, his time is worth a lot.

706
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,140
And so I hope you guys listen to what he's saying.

707
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,900
And I've heard you say a couple of things.

708
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,340
You've repeated a couple of things,

709
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,500
which I've made a note of here.

710
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,500
And you've inspired me to go and reread Think and Grow Rich

711
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,860
for the third or fourth time,

712
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,700
even though I was probably the one that tried to get you

713
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,300
to do it in the beginning when you watched the training.

714
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,140
But you've mentioned that a couple of times,

715
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,740
which has got me thinking, you know what?

716
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,020
I really should dig back into that.

717
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,460
What a powerful book.

718
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,500
So I hope you guys are listening to Mike.

719
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,340
He is somebody, if you guys are not at $40,000,

720
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,140
you should be thinking, what is this guy doing

721
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,220
that I'm not doing?

722
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,140
Or what is he, as Hermosy always talks about,

723
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,700
what is he not doing that I am doing?

724
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,100
And go do that.

725
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,940
It's extremely simple.

726
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,380
Yeah, that's a huge part of getting from the 10 to the 40

727
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,140
and beyond is, what are you not doing?

728
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,540
Like you say, in the YouTube videos,

729
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,020
it's simplification, just focusing on ranking rent only.

730
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,260
Say no to everything else at the right time.

731
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,940
And focusing on the one thing is how you're gonna really

732
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,900
scale this business.

733
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,140
And to be honest, like today I worked a couple of hours.

734
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,140
I've got 38 active retainers.

735
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,180
And I literally got not much to do.

736
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,140
It's all systematized.

737
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,180
That's because I'm focusing on one thing.

738
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,340
Beautiful, bro.

739
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,380
It's beautiful.

740
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,020
Get good at one thing.

741
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,460
Get good at doing a thousand dollar a month

742
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,380
flat fee Legion deal in four or five niches

743
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,780
and doing it again and again and again and again and again.

744
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,060
And you're gonna get rich.

745
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,900
That's it.

746
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,900
So Aaron, let's bust a couple of questions for Mike

747
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,260
if there's any in the chat.

748
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,620
Yeah, we got some good ones.

749
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,820
So Daniel said, Mike, if you had to restart,

750
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,660
how fast would you get back to 40K?

751
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,780
So assuming like knowing now what you know,

752
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,180
like how fast you think you could scale or?

753
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,620
At the moment, I've probably got about five active deals

754
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,580
in my pipeline, my hair table.

755
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,300
So I'm probably closing a new retainer every week.

756
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,500
So about 40 weeks, I'd get back to 40K.

757
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,900
Yeah, that's awesome.

758
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,980
And I would probably add that Mike would probably do that

759
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,060
while maintaining the exact same lifestyle

760
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,260
that he's got right now.

761
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,460
I'm seeing everything systematized.

762
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,620
If you're only around 10K and you're looking to get to 40K,

763
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,940
I definitely recommend a good book.

764
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,900
It's called Systemology.

765
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,380
I've never really been like a super organized guy,

766
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,500
but Systemology has made systematizing the business

767
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,860
like extremely easy.

768
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,260
I recommend that to everyone.

769
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,140
Beautiful, I'm gonna write that down.

770
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,980
Awesome, I'll put that, cool, I'll put that in the chat.

771
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,340
Yeah, and then Kirk Clark says,

772
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,900
and then Kirk Clark says, where are your customers?

773
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,660
Is it U.S. or is it Australia?

774
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,260
Yeah, so all my customers,

775
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,820
pretty much all my clients are in New Zealand.

776
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,020
I've got two in Australia,

777
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,660
and the time difference is about five hours.

778
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,220
So I still wake up at 10 a.m. my time,

779
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,860
which is like five o'clock in New Zealand,

780
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,460
but we're the ones sitting on digital gold,

781
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,820
so that'd be good fun.

782
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,020
But I thought you couldn't do this outside the U.S.

783
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,420
So you have most of your clients in New Zealand,

784
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,420
not Australia, right?

785
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,980
Because you're from New Zealand.

786
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,740
Yeah, dude.

787
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,580
Yeah, weird.

788
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,420
I didn't know you could do this in other countries.

789
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,260
Weird.

790
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,620
Just kidding.

791
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,980
I honestly didn't know that New Zealand was such a market.

792
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,820
That's awesome.

793
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,660
That's great.

794
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,500
I thought it was just like, honestly,

795
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,340
me and the Australian in the U.S., but that's great.

796
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,180
That's sick, dude.

797
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,020
That's sick.

798
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,860
Keep going.

799
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,300
Jerry says, how is your week slash month structured

800
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,060
for achieving those 40K?

801
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,780
What are the crucial tasks you do to progress that fast?

802
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,820
And he says, by the way,

803
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,020
I've got pretty similar goal in mind

804
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,660
with the Muay Thai mastery,

805
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,900
whatever combat sports you're in.

806
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,740
You're really inspiring.

807
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,980
Thanks for the nuggets you dropped so far.

808
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,180
So I guess kind of how you structure to move the needle.

809
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,740
Yes, we do.

810
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,900
Thanks for the compliment on inspiration.

811
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,500
In terms of moving the needle,

812
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,660
I honestly don't have too much structure in my business.

813
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,180
Like my whole mindset is just wake up

814
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,860
and like get in the trenches basically,

815
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,540
but that being said, where I'm at now with the business,

816
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,020
what actually got me from 10 to 40 was,

817
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,860
what does 40K and Mike do?

818
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,740
What does 40K and Mike do?

819
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,180
And I literally embodied that at the start of the year

820
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,700
while everyone was partying for New Year's.

821
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,660
I was reading books on productivity

822
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,660
and it took nine months to catch up with the actions

823
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,380
in terms of hitting the 40K a month goal.

824
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,020
Some key parts of that were also getting my CRM dialed in.

825
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,420
So I've got to thank Ben Van Harten in the group.

826
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:55,420
He's actually in digital business in Thailand.

827
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,940
So getting your CRM sorted,

828
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,180
that's extremely important.

829
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,460
Getting your lead reporting sorted,

830
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,420
getting some sort of system to look at your prospecting deals

831
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,420
and obviously how many leads your current clients are getting.

832
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,220
And I'm going to thank Ryan Dalton.

833
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,660
He's actually an integral part of the business

834
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,580
in terms of outsourcing some of my web builds

835
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,700
and also his RankinRent engine system.

836
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,300
I wouldn't be here without that.

837
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,300
Beautiful.

838
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,260
And as a teaser,

839
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:33,220
the version 2.0 of Ryan's RankinRent engine

840
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,460
is very close to being completed.

841
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,020
So more to come on that.

842
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,060
Anyway, keep going.

843
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,060
Yeah, we got some really good comments here.

844
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,820
I'll just mainly go to the questions,

845
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,020
but we got some really cool comments

846
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,940
and a lot of people appreciate what you're saying, Mike.

847
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,060
So thanks a lot for hopping on.

848
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,020
Matthew, he kind of has like a similar question.

849
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,860
He says, yeah, like, what do you do?

850
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,220
What does your week look like in terms of delegating tasks

851
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,860
for grabbing deals?

852
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,020
And I mean, I guess I can just say,

853
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,980
probably put in the way you got to 40K

854
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,980
was by selling $40,000 worth of deals.

855
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,980
So obviously that sales part.

856
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,980
So I'll personally ask, like,

857
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,220
do you still do the closing calls

858
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,060
and like, have you outsourced everything

859
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,220
about the sales or?

860
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,860
So the only thing I'm outsourcing at the moment

861
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:19,540
is the SEO builds, the SEO website builds.

862
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,140
And I've got a guy that does all my blogging

863
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,540
and I think he employs his cousins in the Philippines.

864
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,260
So yeah, I mean, I'm on 40,000 USD a month

865
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,620
and I don't have a big team.

866
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,540
I haven't got a huge bill of people that I have to pay.

867
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,220
The profit margins are pretty good.

868
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,740
I've got my Google ads bill and then I've got maybe

869
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,180
three to $4,000 of blog post costs

870
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,740
and outsourcing to Ryan's team.

871
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,620
And in six months, those costs,

872
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,980
the profit margins are gonna be even bigger.

873
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,180
So yeah, I'm pretty proud of the fact

874
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,940
that I only have one person that I really outsource to

875
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,740
and the rest is just on autopilot.

876
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,060
So are you still handling all the sales yourself,

877
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,820
like the prospecting and the setup and the close?

878
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,580
Yeah, so I still do all the sales calls.

879
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,420
Yeah, pretty much.

880
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,660
People, the way I do my prospecting

881
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,860
is I actually get people coming to me now

882
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,500
just through my Instagram profile.

883
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,660
But yeah, we'll see if I need to employ some more people

884
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,540
to get to $66,000 in a month.

885
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,300
But I think the way that everything's set up

886
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,660
and systematized and automated,

887
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,140
I think I'll be able to get to $66,000

888
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,980
without having to figure out building a team,

889
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,820
more of a team.

890
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,100
That's awesome, bro.

891
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,260
We got just like one more question.

892
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,420
Nathan, guys, he put in the link to the book.

893
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,540
So thank you for that for systematology, systemology.

894
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,700
Oh, we got two quick questions

895
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,460
and then you can just fire these.

896
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,860
So Jared said, is your technical SEO team

897
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,740
in Thailand with you?

898
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,780
So it sounds like you just got that one guy.

899
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,940
Yeah, so we're a team in the Philippines.

900
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,900
Just one guy doing the blogs with his cousins

901
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,300
and a bit of WordPress work.

902
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,780
Cool, so that's the other.

903
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,620
Did you get them?

904
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,580
Oh, sorry, I was gonna say,

905
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,740
did you get them on onlinejobs.ph

906
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,180
or where'd you find that guy?

907
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,580
Yeah, onlinejobs.ph.

908
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,300
I've been with him for eight months.

909
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,140
He's amazing.

910
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,460
I definitely recommend onlinejobs.ph

911
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,380
for outsourcing really respectful people

912
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,900
with good English and if you treat them well,

913
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,940
they treat you well.

914
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,980
That's awesome, man.

915
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,820
Yeah, we just got one more question.

916
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,860
Nathan says, and I know this depends on

917
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,740
if you ask this question now,

918
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,860
or like you said, in six months,

919
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,900
once a lot of your sites rank,

920
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,540
but how much of the 40K per month is profit?

921
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,140
Just about.

922
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,700
About 60, 65%.

923
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,500
Wow, that's awesome.

924
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,180
Yeah, I'm ranking these sites really fast

925
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,940
thanks to Ryan's team,

926
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,420
and the way they set everything up.

927
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,940
So I'm able to like reduce the ad spins pretty quickly.

928
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,780
And guys, just to add to that real quick,

929
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,020
if Mike were to take everything in-house

930
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,180
and do it all himself and be a solopreneur,

931
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,820
apart from the ad costs that he has,

932
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:22,820
I bet he would be closer to 70, 72, 75% profit margin,

933
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,860
but he's doing exactly what I did,

934
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,220
which is he's building out a team.

935
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,460
He's got people doing content.

936
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,660
He's scaling it,

937
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,700
and he's also got an incredible lifestyle.

938
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,780
So you can do this as much,

939
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,300
like he's doing it smart.

940
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,940
So yeah, he's got a 55% profit.

941
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,220
Let's say he's bringing in, what is it?

942
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,540
22, $23,000 in his pocket every single month,

943
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,100
quarter million bucks.

944
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,860
That's his money,

945
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,740
but he doesn't have to do jack shit.

946
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,140
That's why he's fighting Muay Thai fights, right?

947
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,100
And that's the beauty of the entire thing.

948
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,700
Some of you guys are so scared to get somebody

949
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,700
because, oh, I'm gonna have a recurring cost,

950
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,700
and I gotta, good, just go replace it.

951
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,340
Your content person right now,

952
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,500
I'm sure you, I don't know, maybe,

953
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,340
how long have you had that person?

954
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,180
He's had eight months.

955
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,820
So you've had them since the time

956
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,980
you were probably at 25,000,

957
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,580
and you probably added one or two of his cousins,

958
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,820
but you guys, we're trying to scale this thing.

959
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:25,380
We're not just trying to keep every dollar in our pocket

960
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,940
and do all the work.

961
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,420
It's a lifestyle as well.

962
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:34,660
50%, and let's look at my 38 current deals.

963
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:38,140
Let's say it's about a 60 or a 55% profit margin.

964
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,300
Those same 37 clients in a year's time,

965
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,180
I can guarantee they're gonna be 95% profit margin.

966
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,740
So I'm investing and taking over the Google board

967
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,820
and getting these sites,

968
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,900
just printing money every week on all their partners.

969
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,740
By the way.

970
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,540
I put in the work, ranking them.

971
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,820
I love that you call it the Google board.

972
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,580
I heard that on one of your videos

973
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,340
and I was like, I like that.

974
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,620
It sounds like it's like an interesting way

975
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,020
to say it, the Google board.

976
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,580
The monopoly board.

977
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,180
I'm still running the same sales script,

978
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,500
telling them it's the monopoly board and they love it.

979
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,340
I know exactly what you mean.

980
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,940
I just have never heard it called the Google board

981
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,740
and it makes total sense,

982
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,940
and it's kind of a fun way to say it.

983
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,780
So anyway, just kind of just a side note.

984
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,900
Mike, dude, I have so many more questions,

985
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,860
but we don't have time.

986
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,700
I'm gonna send you some voice notes on WhatsApp

987
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,420
about some stuff.

988
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,300
But dude, more than anything,

989
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:36,300
I think obviously kudos to you because you did the work.

990
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,060
You make the program and us look good,

991
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:44,100
but I do appreciate you coming on, bro.

992
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:44,940
I hope you know that.

993
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,940
And everybody please give Mike a thanks for jumping on

994
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,580
and spending his time.

995
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,820
Dude, when are you gonna hit?

996
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,220
What's the goal to hit the 50?

997
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,780
Like, so a thousand, you're doing about a deal a week.

998
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,460
So what, in about 90 days, roughly?

999
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,100
Yeah, I want to get to a hundred thousand New Zealand dollars

1000
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,660
where we'll get there.

1001
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,500
And I think that's about 66,000 USD.

1002
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,420
And I think after that,

1003
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,540
I'm just gonna be focusing a bit more on

1004
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,660
traveling more around the world

1005
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,700
and getting a bit more systematization done.

1006
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,140
I love that, bro.

1007
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,220
Unbelievable.

1008
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:30,500
It's unbelievable that we, I don't know.

1009
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,220
Do you ever get this way sometimes you wake up

1010
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,060
and you're like, dude, I'm literally selling air.

1011
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,340
Like you guys have seen the Lorax, right?

1012
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,380
Have you guys seen the Lorax, that movie?

1013
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,980
Yeah, a while back.

1014
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,740
You don't have to, if you haven't,

1015
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,060
but you should watch it.

1016
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:46,860
It's hilarious.

1017
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,860
A Dr. Seuss movie.

1018
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,980
And the guy, that little short guy,

1019
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,820
the something O'Hare, I don't know his first name.

1020
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,500
He's a little short guy with the most amazing haircut.

1021
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,140
He sells air.

1022
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,980
Like he's literally like polluting the air

1023
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:02,820
and selling it back to him.

1024
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,220
But I always am like, dude,

1025
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,220
I swear it's like we're selling air.

1026
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,780
Like we're just giving these people the,

1027
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,980
but it's also a valuable service because

1028
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,620
like you could argue, well, if you didn't do this,

1029
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,540
then they would get, no, they wouldn't get the leads.

1030
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,420
The leads would go to the home advisors

1031
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,820
and the Angie's list and the big guys.

1032
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,860
We're fighting between the little guys.

1033
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,260
So no, just because we're in there

1034
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,540
doesn't mean those leads would go to them.

1035
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,020
That's not true at all.

1036
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,060
We're taking the leads from the big guys.

1037
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,500
We're partnering with the little guys

1038
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,820
and we're helping them do business.

1039
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,860
So I joke about us selling air

1040
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,700
because it feels like we're cheating,

1041
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:43,020
but we're offering something that's so valuable

1042
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,100
that it's changes these businesses entirely.

1043
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,540
So anyway, Mike, thanks for jumping on, bro.

1044
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,620
It's my fault in that way.

1045
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,940
Yeah, it doesn't seem like it's real business sometimes

1046
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,380
when you're just looking at these Stripe accounts

1047
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,380
for the green ticks coming in

1048
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,340
and you're getting the head massage.

1049
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,940
But I've got some feedback recently

1050
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,180
from some guys in New Zealand

1051
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:04,260
that their businesses were gonna go under.

1052
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,820
Like they were literally gonna have to close down

1053
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,140
their shops and I get messages saying,

1054
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,140
hey, like we're on a pretty grim spot.

1055
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,380
You've literally saved us.

1056
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,220
We're now at a point

1057
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,540
where we could be taking on more people.

1058
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,820
So like we usually are changing people's lives.

1059
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,140
So it's a beautiful business model

1060
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,620
in pretty much every way possible.

1061
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,100
It's dope, dude.

1062
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:24,940
I love it.

1063
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:25,940
Awesome, thanks for jumping on.

1064
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,460
And Aaron, thank you as well, brother.

1065
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,380
Thanks, guys.

1066
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,220
Cheers.

1067
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,040
Talk to you soon, guys.

1068
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,880
See you, bye.
