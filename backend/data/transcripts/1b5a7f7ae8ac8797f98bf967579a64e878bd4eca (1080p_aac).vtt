If you don't have your first deal, if you don't have enough money to pay your

00:03.600 --> 00:06.040
bills, I want you sticking in tried and true.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.560
I want you to be getting those first deals in fencing, in masonry, in

00:09.560 --> 00:13.360
concrete, in tree service, in whatever, because you don't have to worry about

00:13.360 --> 00:17.740
the niche once you get to a point where your bills are paid, once you get to a

00:17.740 --> 00:24.220
point where, um, you like are comfortable enough that you're not worried about

00:24.220 --> 00:28.340
losing a dollar, some of you are in that spot, then we could start getting tricky,

00:28.340 --> 00:32.800
but I don't think it's bad or a waste of time at all to be actively talking

00:32.800 --> 00:34.820
about different niche ideas.
