00:00.000 --> 00:01.500
like things were working good last week.

00:01.500 --> 00:02.700
And then like a couple weeks ago,

00:02.700 --> 00:06.540
there's been some increases in CPC and you didn't catch it.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.500
And, and I've reviewed how to do that with some of you.

00:09.500 --> 00:11.000
And all of a sudden your ads tank and you're like,

00:11.000 --> 00:11.880
what, what's going on?

00:11.880 --> 00:14.800
And you just, it's just a learning thing with Google.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.700
You just gotta, you gotta just go, well, this is weird.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.140
Gotta go back into the budget, gotta go back into here.

00:20.140 --> 00:23.440
And then you start seeing these changes and you go, oh, okay.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.840
What was $5 is now $11.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.800
And you're like, all right, that makes sense.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.600
So what would you recommend in a situation like that,

00:30.600 --> 00:34.500
as far as like an action step for somebody like that?

00:34.500 --> 00:38.240
And I don't know, let's say, I mean,

00:38.240 --> 00:39.400
I can tell you this is,

00:39.400 --> 00:41.640
let's say this is somebody that you've sold,

00:41.640 --> 00:43.800
like you've actually sold the business owner.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.540
I would just go to them and be honest with them and say,

00:45.540 --> 00:48.040
Hey, my costs have doubled.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.000
And you can explain it like Jeff did, you know,

00:50.000 --> 00:51.680
Google's laid off 12,000 employees.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.600
I think they're trying to make more money on ads,

00:53.600 --> 00:56.280
or I don't know for sure, but my costs have doubled.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.520
Are you comfortable if we bump up, you know,

00:58.520 --> 01:01.680
our deal, you know, if not, that's fine.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.220
But I just don't know if we're gonna be able

01:03.220 --> 01:04.060
to get as many leads.

01:04.060 --> 01:06.320
So I would just be honest in that situation.
