WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.920
Beautiful. Okay. Let's do this. So guys, welcome to I think this is like the seventh call that

00:08.920 --> 00:14.120
we've actually done with this format. Let me get my mic a little bit closer. Again,

00:14.120 --> 00:18.280
we used to do as many people as we could on the Facebook group vanity metrics. Let's get

00:18.280 --> 00:23.560
a whole bunch of people that also last thing, Jason, please make sure everyone's muted.

00:23.560 --> 00:27.400
I think it's default to mute everybody. But if you see that it just distracts on the call.

00:27.400 --> 00:35.720
Just mute everybody. Anyway, this is I think our seventh call. What we're going to do and what I

00:35.720 --> 00:40.840
always do is if you stay on this call till the end and you have your camera on obviously,

00:40.840 --> 00:45.920
then we're going to screenshot everybody that's on this call with around like the last five

00:45.920 --> 00:52.040
minutes and we're going to automatically create and send you guys a digital resource that covers

00:52.040 --> 00:55.720
the things that we talk about in this call. So it's basically going to be the cheat sheet,

00:56.520 --> 01:01.000
the notes that normally you'd have to take or that you should take the highlights. I don't want you

01:01.000 --> 01:04.520
to sit here and take notes on everything because we're going to send that to you if you stay on

01:04.520 --> 01:08.680
the call. What I would rather you do what I want you to do is I want you to just listen and I want

01:08.680 --> 01:14.040
you to the things that come to your mind, the things that the ideas that you have, that's what

01:14.040 --> 01:17.880
I want you to write down because I'm going to send you the information that I'm going to talk about.

01:17.880 --> 01:22.600
I want you to think about and I want you to write down the things that come to your mind. So as I

01:22.680 --> 01:27.640
talk today, you're going to have these ideas that I'm going to spark because of things that I say

01:27.640 --> 01:34.760
and that's what I want you to write down. Also, I am going, because this is a more intimate

01:34.760 --> 01:39.560
like session, I am going to leave time for Q&A. So if you guys do have questions and you don't

01:39.560 --> 01:43.640
want to forget those questions, just start dropping them in the comments and I'm going to

01:43.640 --> 01:48.920
probably Jason read them for me towards the end. Try to stick to competition questions,

01:48.920 --> 01:51.480
but if you have other questions and we have time, I'll also

01:52.520 --> 01:58.520
fill those as well. So that said, guys, let's get into this. Again, anything that I talk about,

01:58.520 --> 02:05.880
and I'll start with this actually, just for the person or the people that don't know, I know some

02:05.880 --> 02:10.920
of you guys have been on a few of these calls, so this might be redundant. That's fine. This is my

02:10.920 --> 02:16.680
eighth year doing this business. I don't know how many niches, probably well over 30 niches

02:16.680 --> 02:24.120
I've tried this in. I don't know how many cities, probably over 100 cities. I've lost millions,

02:24.120 --> 02:29.960
like literally lost millions of dollars. I've gone $60,000 of debt. I've almost quit twice.

02:30.760 --> 02:35.960
And I mean, seriously, like when I almost quit in 2019, I had another sales job completely

02:36.600 --> 02:41.960
lined out, commissions agreed upon, ready to just shut down my agency, ready to get rid of

02:41.960 --> 02:47.880
everyone on my team and just be a sales guy. And I figured it out and I stuck with it.

02:47.880 --> 02:51.960
And then in 2020, we finally figured this out. There were some missing pieces. For those of you

02:51.960 --> 02:58.360
guys that are in other programs, for those of you that are learning rank and rent, the old school

02:58.360 --> 03:04.360
antiquated method where you build a website, you put in all this time and you wait for it to rank,

03:06.360 --> 03:11.480
you guys are doing it the wrong way. And I truly mean that. And I'm telling you that

03:11.480 --> 03:14.920
you're never going to scale doing it how you're doing it. You will never scale.

03:14.920 --> 03:23.560
And I know that from experience. So I used to call this the most perfectly broken business

03:23.560 --> 03:29.960
model on the internet because it's broken. It's perfect because it checks all the boxes. It's

03:29.960 --> 03:36.920
recurring. You own the asset, it's scalable, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But it's broken

03:36.920 --> 03:43.480
because you are rolling the dice. Meaning you're building a website, you're hoping that it ranks,

03:43.480 --> 03:49.400
and if it doesn't, you're screwed. If it does, you're hoping that there's leads. If there are

03:49.400 --> 03:52.440
leads, you're hoping there's a business owner that's hungry. If there's a hungry business owner,

03:52.440 --> 03:56.600
you're hoping you can sell them. And all the while you're waiting six to nine months to even

03:56.600 --> 04:00.920
check this out. You don't even know. That's why it's broken and that's why it's unscalable.

04:00.920 --> 04:05.640
But once you start flipping this on its head, once you start actually selling the deal first

04:05.640 --> 04:10.920
and pre-selling the deal, then you start to be able to scale. You're able to go into a market,

04:10.920 --> 04:15.480
spend a couple hundred dollars, see if it's actually a good market, and then confidently

04:15.480 --> 04:20.040
go in using somebody else's money. That's how you scale this thing. And so I think about it the

04:20.040 --> 04:28.120
same way as real estate. If I was going to build a massive portfolio of real estate portfolio,

04:28.120 --> 04:33.800
it would be very, very, very, very difficult for me to do it if I had to pay for all the houses

04:33.800 --> 04:39.480
myself. Imagine I had to go buy all the houses with my own money, do the down payments or

04:39.480 --> 04:44.760
no, not even the down payments, the construction loan, all of it, and then try to scale. On the

04:44.760 --> 04:49.800
flip side, what if I could go and I could use everyone else's money and I could already have

04:49.800 --> 04:54.520
a guaranteed renter? I could go and build this thing as big as I wanted to. And guys, some of

04:54.520 --> 05:00.440
the biggest real estate companies in the world, there's a company in Dubai called EMAR. This is

05:00.440 --> 05:04.360
what they do. Every single person that comes to that city, they stand in the mall, they send out

05:04.360 --> 05:09.960
flyers, they're hitting you up. They are everywhere. And what they do is basically they bring you in,

05:09.960 --> 05:13.800
they give you the presentation, they tell you why they're the best, and they get you to put

05:13.800 --> 05:19.560
money down on a project, on a specific unit, you pay a chunk upfront, and then they put you on a

05:19.560 --> 05:25.240
payment plan, and they basically have you pay for the project. They have little risk and they know

05:25.240 --> 05:30.360
that it's done and sold by the time it's finished. So if some of the biggest, I think it might be

05:30.840 --> 05:37.160
the biggest or one of the biggest in the world, for sure in Dubai, companies, construction companies

05:37.160 --> 05:41.400
in the world is doing this, then why the heck wouldn't we do this? It's the same exact concept.

05:41.400 --> 05:47.320
So for those that are hearing other advice, I want you to think about that person that's giving you

05:47.320 --> 05:52.280
advice, that program, that whatever, maybe it's someone you follow on YouTube. How much money are

05:52.280 --> 05:55.560
they actually making from this model? What you're going to find is most of the time they're not even

05:55.560 --> 06:01.080
in the game A, and if they are, they're not making any money. And a lot of times you're getting this

06:01.080 --> 06:06.440
advice, build, build, build, build more websites. Why? You shouldn't be building more websites unless

06:06.440 --> 06:11.480
it works. And I've said this example before, but going and building 100 or 200 websites

06:12.840 --> 06:18.840
without pre-selling them is like building 100 units. And then you open your eyes one day and

06:18.840 --> 06:23.720
you're like, oh my gosh, we forgot to put toilets in these things. And I know that's kind of an

06:23.720 --> 06:30.040
extreme example, but it's like, guys, that's what I did. I went into the wrong niche. I went into the

06:30.040 --> 06:35.320
wrong freaking niche. I built like 50 of these things and pulled my head out and went, oh my gosh,

06:35.320 --> 06:41.320
I just built 50 of these in the wrong niche. I got lucky on the first one and it was complete

06:41.320 --> 06:47.240
fluke. And then I built 49 more in the wrong freaking niche because I wasn't pre-selling.

06:47.240 --> 06:52.280
So that said guys, I've been in the game a long time. Anything that I talk about on these calls

06:52.840 --> 06:57.880
is from experience. And if I haven't done it, I'll tell you. And 99% of the time, I won't even cover

06:57.880 --> 07:05.160
it anyway. Okay. So my promise to you guys, my goal to you guys for this call is that by the end

07:05.160 --> 07:09.640
of this training, you're going to have a solid understanding of competition with this business

07:09.640 --> 07:14.440
model. And you're going to be able to see the signs, especially the telltale signs of high

07:14.440 --> 07:21.160
competition, as well as layups, low competition, areas that if you go into, they're going to be

07:21.160 --> 07:26.840
quick wins. They're going to be really high margins, you know, able to rank really quickly,

07:26.840 --> 07:31.560
not have to spend a lot of money on ads. I'm going to, I'm confident you'll be able to understand

07:31.560 --> 07:37.160
and see those areas. Now, is this going to give you a perfect understanding of competition?

07:37.160 --> 07:40.360
Of course not. I'm not going to be able to do that in the next 40 minutes,

07:40.360 --> 07:46.440
but I'm going to be able to give you guys a good 20,000 foot view, enough to have an idea. And then

07:46.440 --> 07:51.400
from there, you can build on that. Okay. And again, just for anyone that wasn't on the last

07:51.400 --> 07:59.160
couple of calls, guys, these calls, my goal with these calls is to give you value, just like with

07:59.160 --> 08:02.840
the, when we give free leads to a business owner, right? When we call a business owner,

08:02.840 --> 08:06.600
we don't just call them up. Hey, let me, you know, you want to buy some leads? No, that's not what

08:06.600 --> 08:10.600
we do. Right. Well, Hey, you want me to rank you on Google? No, that's what everybody does. What do

08:10.600 --> 08:15.800
we do? We call them, Hey, let me give you a couple of free leads. And then we can talk. Let's talk

08:15.800 --> 08:20.280
about business after I've given you some free leads, right? We're being different. I'm doing

08:20.280 --> 08:24.440
that with you guys, because I know that you guys, if you're on this call, with the exception of like

08:24.440 --> 08:30.120
one or two of you, which I can tell are in, uh, I think, yeah, I think Shane is the only one,

08:30.120 --> 08:34.760
obviously Jason, but Shane's in digital landlords. And by the way, Shane, if you have to hop off,

08:35.480 --> 08:38.520
you're going to get all this, all this stuff anyway. So you don't have to stay on since

08:38.520 --> 08:43.000
you're in digital landlords, but, um, everyone else, I know you're interested in this business

08:43.000 --> 08:48.360
model. You're interested in, uh, in, you know, taking the next step and making this a thing,

08:48.360 --> 08:53.560
not just something that's a, that's a hobby. Um, I know what you guys are looking for. You're looking

08:53.560 --> 08:57.720
for the right information. And so what am I going to do? I'm going to give you that right information,

08:57.720 --> 09:03.080
at least a bit of it for free before I ever expect you to work with me, but make no mistake,

09:03.080 --> 09:08.600
this is the same as free leads. My goal with my free group is to earn your business. That's,

09:08.600 --> 09:12.360
that's it. Obviously like, okay, I think I'm a pretty decent person, but that's, I'm not,

09:12.360 --> 09:17.240
I'm not just doing this out of the goodness of my heart. So that's why I'm doing these calls. Okay.

09:17.240 --> 09:21.000
Um, and so it's, it's kind of like this example that I gave a couple of weeks ago.

09:22.120 --> 09:29.640
My goal is I'm basically the guy that's trying to get you, um, enough information and enough

09:29.640 --> 09:34.120
confidence with this model to get you to the gym, right? If we're talking about the gym,

09:34.120 --> 09:37.240
I'm going to get you there. I'm going to, I'm going to give you enough confidence to go buy

09:37.240 --> 09:42.360
a pair of shoes or get a pair of shoes, get the, get to the gym and, and not feel dumb when you're

09:42.360 --> 09:47.080
in the gym, right? However, in order for you to have the body you want in order for you to lose

09:47.080 --> 09:51.480
the fat you want to build the muscle you want, there's no way I can cover it on these calls.

09:51.480 --> 09:55.240
So that's where we have the program that comes in. Just like you would have to get a trainer,

09:55.240 --> 09:58.600
they would tell you the diet, they would show you that hold your hand. That's the difference,

09:58.600 --> 10:04.920
but I will give you enough information, hopefully enough inspiration to take those first steps,

10:04.920 --> 10:11.720
get excited and get in the, in the metaphorical gym, so to speak. So here's the plan really quick

10:11.720 --> 10:15.720
about what's going to, this call is going to look like we're going to spend the next 20 minutes,

10:16.360 --> 10:22.920
20, probably 20 top, maybe 18 on what I want to cover. Then we're going to open this for Q and A

10:22.920 --> 10:25.560
and I'm probably going to keep it to the comment section, but if we have time,

10:25.560 --> 10:30.680
I could also bring you guys on live. And I think that's a really good time. And basically

10:30.680 --> 10:35.080
guys, you're, you're basically getting me and there's only what 10 of you on,

10:36.040 --> 10:41.160
you're getting me to answer your exact questions. So take advantage of those. And if I can answer

10:41.160 --> 10:45.800
it, I will, if I can, I'll be honest with you. Okay. So here's the plan for today's call. Number

10:45.800 --> 10:51.160
one is we're going to talk about the factors that actually matter with competition. Number two,

10:51.160 --> 10:55.560
we're going to talk about telltale signs of highly competitive areas. Three, we're going to talk about

10:55.560 --> 11:03.240
telltale signs of low hanging fruit, AKA layups. Number four, we're going to be talking about what

11:03.240 --> 11:10.120
it means and what you should think when you see an Angie's List and home advisor. And then also

11:10.120 --> 11:15.880
what to do when you spot, what to do, what to think about when you spot other lead generators.

11:15.880 --> 11:20.840
So with that said, let's get right into the call. What I'm going to do really quick. Let me close

11:20.840 --> 11:24.040
my door because my kids are still sleeping and then we're going to get, that's going to be two

11:24.040 --> 11:38.840
seconds. Okay. So let's go, let's get right into this guys. Again, if you have comments, questions,

11:40.120 --> 11:46.840
drop them right now, but take advantage of this guys. It's crazy because I, the reason I do my

11:46.840 --> 11:54.440
YouTube channel, the reason I share so much is when I first was getting into this business,

11:55.000 --> 11:59.960
it was so interesting to me. It really caught my attention. I was really excited about it.

12:00.680 --> 12:04.520
There was a podcast that this guy did that was talking about this. And I swear to you guys,

12:04.520 --> 12:09.480
I listened to this thing like, I'll say like three times in a month or something like that.

12:09.480 --> 12:13.320
I just couldn't get this out of my head. I wanted more and more and more information.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.920
And the thing that I kept running into is like, I kept asking myself,

12:17.640 --> 12:23.240
how do I know like that I should listen to this advice? You know, because this sounds good,

12:23.240 --> 12:26.920
but what is that? And the truth is the person that was actually giving the advice

12:26.920 --> 12:31.880
wasn't even in the game anymore. And the most money they'd ever made was like $30,000 in a

12:31.880 --> 12:35.720
single month. And come to find out, I don't think that was very months in a row, maybe even just one

12:35.720 --> 12:42.120
month in a row. And so I never had somebody who had made a million dollars in this business that

12:42.120 --> 12:47.320
I could listen to. Okay. Much less get on a call with 10 or less people and ask questions. So you

12:47.320 --> 12:51.320
guys need to take advantage of these calls because I'm literally going to answer any questions that

12:51.320 --> 12:57.080
you guys have. Okay. So first things first, let's talk about the factors that actually matter

12:57.080 --> 13:01.320
with competition. I'm going to give you the high level. Basically, there's three things.

13:01.320 --> 13:05.160
Number one is you need to look at the age of the domain. Number two, you want to look at the

13:05.160 --> 13:10.040
content. Number three, you want to look at the backlinks. And I'll add a fourth is you want to

13:10.120 --> 13:15.160
look at the cost per click. Okay. Now, how do you discover these things is I'm going to give

13:15.160 --> 13:19.000
you a quick little tip. And I think I've talked about this in the free group. There is an extension

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
on Chrome called SEO quake. And you guys can literally just go download that on S on, on

13:25.000 --> 13:30.760
Chrome and enable it. And it will show you, there's a bar that will show you. And if we have time,

13:30.760 --> 13:35.160
maybe at the end, I can actually just show you an example, but that's going to actually show you

13:35.160 --> 13:41.240
how many backlinks each website has. It's going to give you a quick link to the who is where you

13:41.240 --> 13:48.040
can see the age of the domain. And then you obviously can kind of eyeball the content, right?

13:48.760 --> 13:55.160
For CPC, you can go use a bunch of different tools. And also with backlinks, guys, the tool,

13:56.040 --> 14:03.080
this SEO quake, it's literally called SEO and then Q U A K E. I have it on all of my computers.

14:03.080 --> 14:07.400
It's free. And by the way, I always use Chrome. You don't have to, I just found that it's very

14:07.400 --> 14:16.040
convenient because the Chrome store anyway, it'll show you how many backlinks. Now, if the area

14:16.040 --> 14:23.080
looks competitive, right? And there's a good content, the domains are old, et cetera. You're

14:23.080 --> 14:27.240
going to want to go a step further and you're going to want to look at the quality of the backlinks,

14:27.240 --> 14:33.640
because it's not about how many backlinks a website has. It's about the quality of the

14:33.640 --> 14:37.960
backlinks. And what I mean by that, and that we can do a whole training on backlinks. But

14:38.680 --> 14:47.880
if I get a backlink from, let's just say a local review website, right? That's decent. And it might

14:47.880 --> 14:52.520
help if I'm building a website in St. George, Utah, because it's a little bit relevant because

14:52.520 --> 14:59.800
of it's St. George, right? However, if I compare that to a backlink that I get from, let's say,

15:00.680 --> 15:07.080
Forbes, right? Forbes.com gives me a backlink. There's no competition. I would much rather

15:07.080 --> 15:11.720
have one backlink from Forbes than a hundred backlinks from all the little review websites

15:11.720 --> 15:18.360
in St. George, because the quality, it matters and the quality is much more important in quantity.

15:18.920 --> 15:25.640
So guys, number one, age of domain. Number two, content. Number three, backlinks. Number four,

15:25.640 --> 15:32.680
CPC. Also as a rule of thumb, make sure I'm going to put this in the notes. Hold on.

15:34.200 --> 15:43.960
I'm going to put this in the notes, less than $5. And I could show you guys my Google Ads spending

15:44.680 --> 15:49.960
and my average cost over, I don't think I have it on this phone. Maybe I can check out the exact,

15:49.960 --> 15:56.840
it's definitely less than $5. Let me see if I have Google Ads here. I don't have it on this phone.

15:57.400 --> 16:07.880
So if I pulled this up, my average spend is like $3.50 or $3.70 across $1.5 million spend.

16:08.440 --> 16:13.960
If you guys are going into areas, make sure that the cost per click of the main keywords

16:13.960 --> 16:19.640
is less than $5. And if it's not, don't do it. Period. I don't care how good it looks,

16:19.640 --> 16:24.600
do not do it. Just my two cents. Okay. And what do I know? I've only made millions of dollars

16:24.600 --> 16:29.800
doing this. Okay. So that's the factors that actually matter. Okay. And if you have questions,

16:29.800 --> 16:33.640
these are perfect questions to ask here in about 10 minutes when we have questions. Okay.

16:33.640 --> 16:38.120
Number two, what are the telltale signs of a highly competitive area?

16:40.120 --> 16:43.720
Here's, I'm just going to give you, this is the thing, this is kind of the litmus test.

16:43.720 --> 16:51.080
If I see this, I just don't even touch it. Okay. And what it is guys is when you guys are looking

16:51.080 --> 16:55.000
at an area, because what you want to do is if you pick a city, you pick a niche, you have to make

16:55.000 --> 16:59.400
sure that you're going to be able to get in and rank the website. Because if you can't get in and

16:59.400 --> 17:04.200
rank the website, then this business model isn't what this business model is. This is a rank and

17:04.200 --> 17:08.440
rent business model, right? You need to be able to get in, rank the website so that the calls become

17:08.440 --> 17:13.320
free and the margins become fat. And so if I look at an area, let's just say Las Vegas concrete.

17:13.320 --> 17:17.400
So that's an easy example to use. If I look at Las Vegas concrete, there's a lot of, you know,

17:17.400 --> 17:21.720
we know the niche works. We know there's a lot of people searching for concrete because it's a big

17:21.720 --> 17:28.920
population, but I look at it and it's really competitive. And it's going to be in the websites

17:28.920 --> 17:34.040
that are at the top of Google are really good websites. They have old domains. They have

17:35.400 --> 17:41.080
really good content. They have good backlinks. Even though there's a good opportunity. Once I

17:41.080 --> 17:47.320
rank, I have to be honest with myself and go, what are the actual chances of me ranking? How

17:47.320 --> 17:53.160
much work is it actually going to take for me to rank? And is it going to be worth the squeeze?

17:53.160 --> 17:57.160
And that those are the questions that you have to ask yourself, because sometimes as good as it is,

17:57.160 --> 18:01.080
it's not worth it guys. There are businesses that are really good out there. You know,

18:01.080 --> 18:06.680
that's what's a really good business is solar. I have friends. I have a neighbor slash friend.

18:06.680 --> 18:11.960
It also my kids football coach. He makes a lot of money and he does solar, but he got into the

18:11.960 --> 18:16.760
right area at the right time and he's been doing it for 10 years. And so if I look at solar and

18:16.760 --> 18:22.600
I'm like, I'm just going to get into it. It's so competitive right now. Yeah, I could, I could,

18:22.600 --> 18:26.200
but you know how much, you know, how much competition is in that business. It's insane,

18:26.200 --> 18:31.880
right? Roofing also a good business, but it's a very competitive business, right? So we have

18:31.880 --> 18:37.960
to look at those things. So a telltale sign that it's a very highly competitive area is you always

18:37.960 --> 18:42.920
want to search. You always want to clear your browsing history and you want to search for the

18:42.920 --> 18:47.160
main keywords. And that's a whole nother training in itself is what are the main keywords? How do

18:47.160 --> 18:51.960
you build a keyword list? How do you know what your core keyword list, all these things we cover,

18:51.960 --> 18:56.120
obviously in depth of the training, but we have covered in bits and pieces inside of the Facebook

18:56.120 --> 18:59.960
group that you guys can go search. But once you get your core keyword list, you want to clear

18:59.960 --> 19:04.600
your browsing history because you want it to be a fresh search as if you're somebody who's never

19:04.600 --> 19:10.520
searched before. And you want to search all these terms. So concrete Las Vegas, concrete contractor,

19:10.520 --> 19:16.360
Las Vegas, concrete company, Las Vegas, concrete sidewalk, Las Vegas, concrete walkway or driveway,

19:16.360 --> 19:20.840
Las Vegas, right? Las Vegas, Nevada, all these things we want to just, we want to do multiple.

19:20.840 --> 19:24.840
This is one of the things that they didn't teach me in my first training. I didn't realize that

19:24.840 --> 19:31.240
you should probably search more than one keyword. I was the dummy that was typing towing Huntsville.

19:31.240 --> 19:36.200
And I would, I would literally made my decision based on that. I looked at the term towing

19:36.200 --> 19:40.200
Huntsville. I searched it. It looked decent. I didn't even really know what I was looking at.

19:40.200 --> 19:46.760
And I based my entire decision of going into towing Huntsville on one term. And that's it.

19:46.760 --> 19:52.200
And literally I got so lucky that it actually was low-hanging fruit. I didn't do it. It wasn't

19:52.200 --> 19:57.160
because I was good. It wasn't because I knew what I was doing. I just got lucky, right? But guys,

19:57.160 --> 20:02.360
you have to look at multiple terms because let's say that towing Huntsville or Las Vegas concrete

20:02.360 --> 20:07.800
is very easy to rank for, right? There's not much competition, blah, blah, blah. But let's say

20:09.160 --> 20:14.440
Las Vegas concrete contractors is highly competitive. Las Vegas concrete company is

20:14.440 --> 20:20.360
highly competitive. Concrete sidewalk is highly competitive. Then out of all the terms that I want

20:20.360 --> 20:26.120
to rank for out of seven terms, only one of them looks feasible. I'm not going into that area. So

20:26.120 --> 20:30.120
you have to look at more than one. So here's the deal is once you search, once you number one,

20:30.120 --> 20:34.840
figure out ability keyword list, and you have that keyword list, you're going to search for those

20:34.840 --> 20:40.680
keywords with the area. Okay. At the end of it. So Las Vegas concrete or concrete Las Vegas plus

20:40.680 --> 20:43.960
the other seven terms. And I'm going to have all the tabs pulled up to what I usually do.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.600
Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull all those up and I'm going to look,

20:48.600 --> 20:53.320
this is just a quick way. And I don't know why this is the case, but I can almost

20:53.320 --> 20:59.880
always guarantee that when this happens, it's highly competitive. Okay. If you start looking

20:59.880 --> 21:04.520
at all, let's say you open the first tab and you, what I always do is I look at who's actually in

21:04.520 --> 21:10.680
the maps. Okay. Now I don't spend a bunch of time in maps to this day. I have kind of just

21:11.320 --> 21:16.920
set it aside. If I can always try to get the map, the Google, my business, but I don't spend time

21:16.920 --> 21:21.320
obsessing over it because I realized if I can rank organically and I can get my ads running,

21:21.320 --> 21:25.080
I don't need the maps. The maps is a bonus. So for those of you that think you need map,

21:25.080 --> 21:29.560
but you don't. Okay. Promise you, I built a million dollar company without even

21:29.560 --> 21:33.960
worrying about maps. In fact, most, most of my projects, when I hit the million dollar mark in

21:34.600 --> 21:40.040
2020 did not even have Google GMBs. Okay. You don't need them. You can make a million dollars

21:40.040 --> 21:47.560
without them. That's a fact. Okay. But so, but for whatever reason, there is a strong correlation

21:47.560 --> 21:52.680
between who's ranking in the maps and who's ranking organically. And so what I look at guys

21:52.680 --> 22:00.360
is I go and I open all the tabs and I look at who's the number one in the maps. Okay. Let's say it's

22:00.360 --> 22:06.040
Bob's concrete. Okay. Then I'm going to open up second tab is Bob's concrete in the maps. Yes.

22:06.040 --> 22:12.200
Okay. Is it in the same spot? Okay. Bob's concrete is ranked the first, the first listing in the maps

22:12.200 --> 22:15.720
for the first two terms. And I'm going to look at the third and I'm looking at the fourth and I'm

22:15.720 --> 22:21.000
going to look at all seven or all five. I would say minimum five up to seven keywords. And guys,

22:21.000 --> 22:27.720
I'm going to do that. And I'm going to look at if that Bob's concrete is ranking for the majority

22:27.720 --> 22:31.880
of those terms in the same spot in the maps. Okay. And I'm going to do that. I'm going to see

22:31.880 --> 22:35.720
what the main, like what are the main companies ranking in the maps? Now, again, I just said,

22:35.720 --> 22:40.120
we're not worried too much about math, but for some reason, this is a strong indicator

22:40.120 --> 22:44.760
of a highly competitive area. Once I do that, guys, I'm going to go and I'm going to look at

22:44.760 --> 22:49.720
those same exact terms. I'm going to open those tabs back up and I'm going to look who's ranking

22:50.360 --> 22:55.320
organically. If you're brand new and you don't know what I'm talking about underneath the maps

22:55.320 --> 23:00.520
is the organic section, the actual listings, right? So now I'm going to look who's ranking

23:00.520 --> 23:04.760
on page one and at the top of page one. So I'm going to go, okay, Bob's concrete.

23:04.760 --> 23:11.640
He ranked in the maps, number one for five out of the seven terms. And he's ranking number one

23:11.640 --> 23:17.480
for five of the terms and number two on page one for two of the terms. This guy's basically glued

23:17.480 --> 23:21.720
to the top. I'm going to make a mental note and I'm going to go to the next one. That's Sally's

23:21.720 --> 23:27.320
concrete. And we do the same thing and we go to the next one. Okay. If you guys see the same three

23:27.320 --> 23:32.440
companies showing up over and over and over for the majority of the terms, if you're doing seven

23:32.440 --> 23:36.760
and that's four of them, or if you're doing five and there's three of them and the same three

23:36.760 --> 23:44.840
companies are showing up for the majority of those terms. Okay. Number one and B, if those companies

23:44.840 --> 23:51.320
are also showing up on the organic on page one, especially at the top for the majority of the

23:51.320 --> 23:57.560
keywords, you need to get the heck out of there. I don't care how low the CPC is. I don't care how

23:57.560 --> 24:03.720
bad you want to do it. Do not do it. And for whatever reason, and this is my theory is that

24:03.720 --> 24:08.280
Google wants to give the business to the local guys. We're the ones that spend the freaking money

24:08.280 --> 24:12.200
with Google ads. We're the ones. And when I say local, I'm representing the local guy, right?

24:12.200 --> 24:16.440
Even though I don't own the concrete company, I am representing the local concrete company.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.880
They know that we're the ones that are going to always be there. We have to, we need Google. We're

24:21.880 --> 24:26.280
the ones that are going to spend the money on Google ads, et cetera. They would like to give

24:26.280 --> 24:32.760
the spots to the local guy. They really would. And I truly like think that, and that's, we're

24:32.760 --> 24:37.480
going to get into some others, some, when we talk about home advisor, I think if they can,

24:37.480 --> 24:44.360
they like to give it to local. So if I see people that are ranking again and again and again in the

24:44.360 --> 24:49.480
maps, they're also ranking organically. It's basically like Google telling us out loud,

24:49.480 --> 24:55.880
Hey, I've chosen my people, man. These are my recommended people. And when people search in

24:55.880 --> 25:01.960
this city, they've proven that they're the guys, they're the gals. And for whatever reason, guys,

25:01.960 --> 25:06.120
if you see those same companies showing up again and again in the maps and also showing up

25:06.120 --> 25:12.120
organically, especially at the top, it's too competitive. Especially if you don't have any

25:12.120 --> 25:16.200
money coming in, especially if you haven't gotten out of your job. Now, if you've gone and you're

25:16.200 --> 25:20.920
at like Jason, Jason, Jason, what did you just hit by the way in your agency? What are you at per month?

25:23.960 --> 25:29.800
Cool story. I, I closed three deals in the last seven days. So that's crazy. I closed two deals

25:29.800 --> 25:35.240
last night. So we're at almost 14,000, three, we're at 13,000 right now, but closer to the

25:35.240 --> 25:41.080
$14,000 range. Sick dude. Once we get off that call, this call, I want you to post that in the

25:41.080 --> 25:46.040
group, in the free group, because it just inspires people. By the way, Jason, when did you start

25:46.040 --> 25:52.680
this business? Like a year ago? Yeah, much less than a year ago. I actually didn't get my

25:52.680 --> 25:58.600
head underwatered, like actually diving straight into this business model until the end of January

25:58.600 --> 26:03.880
of this year. That's dope, dude. For, and, and just real quick, this is one of his calls about, but

26:04.760 --> 26:11.480
did you, were you previously in digital marketing? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I did SEO.

26:11.480 --> 26:18.200
You did SEO and you decided to convert to this? Yeah. So I'm sure a lot of you guys have found

26:18.200 --> 26:23.480
Nick's YouTube channel, right? Everything makes so much sense. So if any of you guys come from

26:23.480 --> 26:31.240
RankinRent or SEO, this business model makes so much sense. And it's all, it's all paid off.

26:31.400 --> 26:36.280
Literally, all I do is I just follow Nick's steps that he's laid out for me. The next thing I know,

26:36.280 --> 26:42.280
I'm on a closing call and a guy's handing over his credit card. It's really that simple.

26:43.720 --> 26:49.080
14K, that's, that's, that's amazing, bro. Good job. I didn't even know that. So congrats on the 14K.

26:49.080 --> 26:53.400
Thanks, man. And I think you could probably be a testament that like,

26:53.400 --> 27:03.080
when I found this as well, guys, when there's a process that works, if you just follow it,

27:03.080 --> 27:06.920
it works. And if it works once, it's going to work again. And I don't know if you noticed

27:06.920 --> 27:11.720
that Jason, but like, when you first follow the process, it's almost like, you almost don't

27:11.720 --> 27:16.760
believe it can be that simple. I'm not saying easy. I'm saying simple. Right. And you follow

27:16.760 --> 27:22.360
it and it works. You're like, no way. Right. And, and he just do it again and again. And then

27:22.360 --> 27:25.640
I promise you, and I'm begging you, Jason, because everyone does this. I think you might

27:25.640 --> 27:28.920
have even gone through this already, but, and then everyone gets too smart and they,

27:28.920 --> 27:32.200
they try too early to innovate. There's nothing wrong with innovation, but if it works,

27:32.200 --> 27:39.800
it's like, okay, Jason's got to $14,000 per month. So why not just go do that eight more times?

27:40.600 --> 27:44.360
Like you, you know what I mean? Or when I go to that, you know, you do that four more times,

27:44.360 --> 27:48.520
you're at $60,000 a month. You're probably with, with the profit margin, you're probably making

27:48.520 --> 27:52.600
close to, you know, half a million dollars a year in your pocket, you know, but we get too

27:52.600 --> 27:57.160
smart and we're like, oh, I'm going to go learn Facebook ads or whatever. But yeah, just, I mean,

27:57.720 --> 28:03.400
have you seen, and you could completely disagree, but what I've seen is that when you have a process

28:03.400 --> 28:08.440
that works and you follow it, you just follow it exactly to a T because the person that's teaching

28:08.440 --> 28:12.440
you it, as long as they're credible, they're saying the things they're saying for a reason.

28:12.440 --> 28:21.080
Yeah, yeah, for sure. One thing I can say also is even though I have all of your resources in front

28:21.080 --> 28:26.600
of me, sometimes like I was getting on a roll, right? So there was a few steps that I decided,

28:26.600 --> 28:31.640
oh, I, I got this, like, I'm not going to apply this step, you know, this should be a lay down and,

28:32.200 --> 28:38.120
and I lost the deal because I wasn't listening to that one thing Nick was telling me to do,

28:38.200 --> 28:41.800
whatever it is, there were so many things throughout the process that,

28:41.800 --> 28:45.400
you know, to be honest, I feel like I should be at $20,000 per month

28:45.960 --> 28:48.840
because I chose to ignore certain things that you were telling me to do.

28:50.360 --> 28:54.040
So it's, it's not, it requires a lot of hard work, but you have to do

28:55.240 --> 29:00.120
things correctly. You can't just go out there and just ask somebody to hand you their money or

29:00.120 --> 29:03.960
take these free leads and work with me. Like you have to qualify the business owner

29:04.040 --> 29:09.480
that there's a whole thorough process that you have to go through with vetting your business owner

29:10.120 --> 29:13.320
and qualifying them before they even waste your time in the first place.

29:14.920 --> 29:21.560
Yeah. And it's just like, I've used this example. It's like having the perfect recipe for the

29:21.560 --> 29:27.960
perfect chocolate cake, right? It, you know, you can go and try to put the sugar in at a different

29:27.960 --> 29:32.760
time and you're just risk it. You make, you could try to use a different brand of sugar. You could

29:32.760 --> 29:37.480
try to use brown sugar instead of white sugar. You could try to whatever for glow the flower.

29:38.280 --> 29:42.120
But if you just follow the recipe, the perfect cake is going to come out. If you decide not

29:42.120 --> 29:45.800
to follow it, then you're, you don't know. And you're just kind of up in the air. So

29:46.920 --> 29:51.640
anyway, appreciate you, you jumping in on that. This Salim guy, you can just remove him because

29:51.640 --> 29:56.520
he's too late to the call. That's in the waiting. Oh, he, he said that he had a license issue.

29:57.480 --> 30:02.520
So you can let him in, you can let him in. Okay. Okay. Real quick. Telltale signs that we're going

30:02.520 --> 30:09.080
to get into questions that everybody has. So guys, on the other hand, what are the telltale signs

30:09.080 --> 30:13.560
of low hanging fruit? What are the telltale signs of a layup? What are the telltale signs? If I see

30:13.560 --> 30:19.560
this thing, I'm going in no matter what. And that is really, really simple. It's two things. Number

30:19.560 --> 30:24.360
one is it's the opposite of what I just explained, which means if you do your, your research, if you

30:24.360 --> 30:29.080
clear your browsing history, you search your five to seven terms and you see that the companies in

30:29.080 --> 30:34.040
the maps are completely scattered. It's different companies. It's Bob, then it's Sally, then it's

30:34.040 --> 30:40.840
Frank, then it's Las Vegas concrete. Then it's super concrete and they're all different. And

30:40.840 --> 30:45.400
underneath in the organic, they're all different. And most of them are on page two or on page three.

30:45.400 --> 30:51.480
And it's just a big jumble, mumble, jumble. That's a good sign. That's a, a strong indicator

30:51.480 --> 30:57.080
that it's actually not competitive because it's not consistent. And so basically the way I view

30:57.080 --> 31:01.240
it is Google's trying to figure out who the best person is. And for each term, they're kind of

31:01.240 --> 31:07.000
sending people to different companies. And so whenever I see a scattering or I see that there's

31:07.000 --> 31:10.600
a bunch of different companies showing up in the maps and there's no consistency and there's no one

31:10.600 --> 31:15.240
company that's dominating. I love that. That gets me really excited. That's number one. Number two,

31:15.640 --> 31:20.680
this is when I get really excited is if you guys are searching your terms, you search your seven

31:20.680 --> 31:27.240
terms, okay, your five terms, concrete, concrete contractors, concrete company, et cetera. And you

31:27.240 --> 31:34.600
have at least one company in the, in the maps that's showing up consistently for the top three

31:35.080 --> 31:41.880
across all the terms. And that company does not have a website. Okay. And what I mean by that is

31:42.840 --> 31:48.600
it is possible to get a Google my business or Google business profile and get it ranked

31:49.160 --> 31:55.000
and not even have a website. It is possible. And if you come across this guys and you see it's that,

31:55.000 --> 32:02.520
that one, let's say it's, let's say it's called a Las Vegas, Las Vegas, number one concrete company.

32:02.520 --> 32:08.360
That's the listing and they're showing up for all seven terms, all seven terms they're showing up

32:08.360 --> 32:13.800
for. Okay. In the maps and you look and you go and you're like, wait, where's their website?

32:13.800 --> 32:18.120
And it's, they don't even have a website. It's literally doesn't even have a link for a website.

32:18.120 --> 32:24.440
It's just a listing guys. I can tell you I'm, I'm going into that. I'm going into it. Cause I know

32:24.440 --> 32:28.680
that I'm going to be able to rank that pretty dang quickly. And I'll tell you an example of when I

32:28.680 --> 32:37.640
did this, um, I had this client in, uh, in, in St. George and I can't, I can't even remember,

32:37.640 --> 32:43.320
but it was in a specific niche and I was doing the research in a city called Cedar city,

32:43.320 --> 32:48.760
which is about 45 minutes to an hour north of here. And I just, for fun, I went, I did all the

32:48.760 --> 32:55.080
terms and guys, I think it was not only one, but I think two of the top three didn't have websites

32:55.080 --> 33:00.680
for all the terms. And literally I don't believe in rank and rent. I truly do not believe in rank

33:00.680 --> 33:05.000
and rent because I think it's a waste of time, but I was, I've done this enough that when I saw it,

33:05.640 --> 33:11.240
I also had enough search volume. It also had low CPC and I already had a client because I had that

33:11.240 --> 33:15.720
client in St. George. I knew they'd buy the leads in Cedar city. I just went and I called Francesca

33:15.720 --> 33:20.600
or I text her, I slacked her and I said, Hey, buy the domain for Cedar city, whatever.com

33:21.480 --> 33:24.200
build the website. She's like, are you sure? We usually do the one page. I'm like, no,

33:24.200 --> 33:28.920
just build a website. We built a website, no backlinks, nothing did. We did our rate,

33:28.920 --> 33:33.320
everything else normal, just how we know what we did, you know, sound SEO. We built it within

33:33.320 --> 33:37.720
three months. That thing was completely glued to the top and it stayed there. Okay. And I, and,

33:37.720 --> 33:43.720
and so I'm telling you guys, if you see the, the same company showing up over and over and over

33:43.720 --> 33:49.160
in the maps for the top three, for the main search terms, and they have no website, that's a really

33:49.160 --> 33:54.760
good sign. You should get excited because it's going to be relatively easy to rank. Okay. Last

33:54.760 --> 33:59.080
two things. What does it mean? We see a home advisor and Angie's list. It means it's, it's,

33:59.160 --> 34:03.080
it's a good thing. Okay. It's a good thing. Don't get scared. Don't think, oh my gosh,

34:03.080 --> 34:07.720
it's home advisor. It's Angie's list. No, the reason why it's good is because guys,

34:07.720 --> 34:13.000
if you see home advisor, that means that especially obviously home advisor is going to be in the,

34:13.000 --> 34:17.720
in the organic underneath the maps. If you see home advisor showing up for every one of the search

34:17.720 --> 34:26.120
terms, what that means is that home advisor is ranking their page over everyone else's website.

34:26.120 --> 34:30.920
What I mean by that is it's homeadvisor.com forward slash Kansas city or forward slash

34:30.920 --> 34:35.720
concrete slash Kansas. I don't know what their, their structure is, but whatever their link

34:35.720 --> 34:42.440
structure is, it's, they're, they're ranking a page over a website. And that, that is defying

34:42.440 --> 34:48.200
logic, which means like, it's always easier to rank a website. If I have a, you know, let's call

34:48.200 --> 34:54.360
it a Las Vegas concrete.com. And I am, I am targeting Las Vegas only, and I'm targeting

34:54.360 --> 35:02.120
concrete only. And I'm going against somebody who is, you know, best concrete contractor.com

35:02.120 --> 35:09.080
forward slash Las Vegas. They're trying to rank their single page against my domain. And I have a,

35:09.080 --> 35:14.280
I have an advantage. And so if I see that home advisor is ranking for all the terms, I don't

35:14.280 --> 35:19.800
run. I love, I actually prefer. So if you guys see home advisor, Angela's showing up at the top of

35:19.800 --> 35:26.840
Google, good sign. Okay. Lastly, guys is what to do, what to do when you spot another lead gen.

35:28.120 --> 35:33.400
I had this completely backwards. I thought that if I saw another lead gen, I got so upset. I was

35:33.400 --> 35:40.200
like, oh my gosh, that's saturated. This business model, guys, this is back in 2016, 17, 18, 19.

35:40.200 --> 35:43.640
I was thinking this. If I saw another lead generator, it completely put me off. And I was

35:43.640 --> 35:47.960
like, gosh dang it. I should have come here earlier. I missed my, my, you know, I missed

35:47.960 --> 35:53.080
my window, all these different things. And then one day, and I've told the story before,

35:53.080 --> 35:55.080
and by the way, it's the last story I'm going to tell them. We're going to get the Q and A.

35:55.080 --> 35:58.360
We have 10 minutes. If you guys have questions, drop them in the comments or yeah. In the comments

35:58.360 --> 36:05.560
section is I'm looking at St. George tree service. Okay. And I look at it and I find another lead

36:05.560 --> 36:10.520
generator and I'm like, gosh freaking dang it. I was late to the game. So I'm like, all right,

36:10.520 --> 36:14.360
I'm going to go. I'm going to figure out who it is. I go, I do the who is, and they didn't buy

36:14.360 --> 36:18.760
the privacy. So I could, I found their name and I'm like, let me just look. And I looked in one of

36:18.760 --> 36:22.520
my Facebook groups because I could tell it was a website. It looked really similar to mine. So I

36:22.520 --> 36:27.160
looked at the Facebook group for that name. Sure enough, I could, I found their, their Facebook

36:27.160 --> 36:33.240
profile. I got, I'm sure I could still find the Facebook messages. So I find the Facebook profile

36:33.240 --> 36:37.400
and I'm like, before I give up on this, let me just reach out to this person and see if they're

36:37.400 --> 36:42.840
because what I did before that guys is I called the website to see if it actually had a client,

36:42.840 --> 36:46.040
right? I didn't call. I didn't click on their ads because they weren't running ads.

36:46.040 --> 36:50.840
I clicked on it. I called and nobody answered. And I did that a couple of times. I was like, dude,

36:50.840 --> 36:54.840
no one's buying these leads. They're not even touching this website and it's ranking.

36:54.840 --> 36:59.000
That's when I reached out and I was like, Hey, my name's Nick, blah, blah, blah. I'm in the same

36:59.000 --> 37:03.320
program. Would you be interested in selling your, your website? Like don't no disrespect,

37:03.320 --> 37:10.440
but I'd love to buy it or talk, talk numbers. And basically this person, they basically got offended

37:10.440 --> 37:15.880
and told me, you know, to go eat sand. And I don't know what it was. And maybe I was having

37:15.880 --> 37:21.880
a bad day, whatever, but I just literally out of spite, I was like, you know what? Screw them.

37:21.880 --> 37:24.680
If you're not going to sell me your website and you don't even have a client, I'm going to build

37:24.680 --> 37:31.080
one anyway. And I'm going to go get a client. And keep in mind at the time we were just now starting

37:31.080 --> 37:36.520
to do rent than rank. I was running ads. So I had this like confidence that, Hey, we can do this in

37:36.520 --> 37:42.280
the city. And I guys, I confidently went into St. George and I landed a client. It was just about

37:42.280 --> 37:47.800
a week after COVID started. I sent a couple of leads, met this guy to coffee shop, totally did

37:47.800 --> 37:53.320
everything wrong. He went and talked to his wife, but because I had sent them the leads and I,

37:53.320 --> 37:57.480
that's when I realized the power of sending leads, by the way that he called me, his name was Tony.

37:57.480 --> 38:01.880
He's like, dude, let's do this. I met him at a Maverick, which is a gas station because it was

38:01.960 --> 38:09.640
COVID outside, literally signed a contract over the hood and had these guys for over three years

38:09.640 --> 38:13.400
before they went a different direction over three years. And I made here, I'll tell you right now,

38:14.040 --> 38:22.600
if I can, if I can pull it up real quick. Oh, by the way, this is nice. I made two, I made

38:22.600 --> 38:29.160
just 150, not much, but I made $150 at 205, which I always love because I love making money when

38:29.160 --> 38:37.000
I'm sleeping. It always feels good. Hold on tree service. Let me see if I can find this company

38:37.000 --> 38:44.840
and tell you guys exactly how much I have made from this website that I almost didn't go into

38:44.840 --> 38:50.840
St. George tree service right there. Where are you at, bro? Okay. St. George tree service leads.

38:52.040 --> 38:55.960
It might not let me, it's going to make me sign in. Hold on. Let me do one more thing. It's called,

38:55.960 --> 39:02.600
um, hold on. I would love to tell you guys the exact amount of money I've made. I just

39:02.600 --> 39:10.760
want to tell you guys how freaking much I would have lost out on if companies, where's that?

39:13.560 --> 39:19.160
Okay. It's not going to let me. Anyway, I know it's, it's well over $20,000 point being is I

39:19.160 --> 39:24.120
almost didn't go into it because I saw another lead generator. I went in, not only did I go in,

39:24.120 --> 39:27.640
I got a client. It was over a thousand dollars a month, had them for over three years. So yeah,

39:27.640 --> 39:32.280
I would have made way more than that. I would have made, uh, over $30,000 and I can find the

39:32.280 --> 39:36.440
number for you, but for some reason, like I, it's the mobile is kind of hard to find. So anyway,

39:36.440 --> 39:40.760
guys, um, when you see other lead generators, what the point is treat them as if they're just

39:40.760 --> 39:44.760
another business, right? As if you didn't know what a lead gen site looked like, as if it's just

39:44.760 --> 39:50.440
another Sally's concrete, Mark's concrete, Jack's concrete, look at the age of the domain, look at

39:50.440 --> 39:57.080
the content, look at the backlinks and treat it like any other website. And if it's still is low

39:57.080 --> 40:02.920
competition, then go into it. Who cares? Just because I have a lead generation site and I have

40:02.920 --> 40:06.760
a client doesn't mean you can guys. I just barely did a YouTube video on Bentonville concrete,

40:06.760 --> 40:11.160
like a couple of weeks ago, maybe a week ago. I think it was a couple of weeks ago. And as I'm

40:11.160 --> 40:16.120
doing the video live, I noticed that the number two result is a lead gen site. So somebody took

40:16.120 --> 40:21.400
my advice. They're like, Hey, this guy has a, uh, a project. This guy has a client, but why can't I

40:21.400 --> 40:27.480
go in have be number two and go and get a client too. And I don't know if they have a client,

40:27.480 --> 40:31.240
but they have a website that's ranking and I'm sure they're getting leads. So just because you

40:31.240 --> 40:35.480
see a lead gen site does not mean it's kind of, it's completely competitive. And so that's the

40:35.480 --> 40:38.520
truth. And that's the things you want to cover. So guys, what we covered today, which we're going

40:38.520 --> 40:44.440
to use this outline to create the digital resource that we're going to set up. So those of you that

40:44.440 --> 40:49.240
are on here in the next seven minutes, um, is number one, what are the factors that matter?

40:49.240 --> 40:52.680
Number two, the telltale signs of a highly competitive area. Number three, the telltale

40:52.680 --> 41:01.720
signs of a low hanging fruit slash a layup area, a gimme a lay down. Um, what also, what it means

41:01.720 --> 41:06.200
when you see home advisor and Angie's list, when they're ranking and what, what, what it means when

41:06.200 --> 41:11.480
you spot other lead gens and what you should do. So that said, guys, are there any comments,

41:11.480 --> 41:17.000
any questions? Jason, if you wouldn't mind, can you go ahead and open that up? And if there are,

41:17.000 --> 41:22.600
let's go through those really quick. Yeah. Yeah. We got a few here. Um, let's see.

41:23.560 --> 41:29.480
So Joel asks, did your view of competition change from your earlier years compared to now?

41:29.480 --> 41:35.160
If so, how? Yeah, because my, I didn't know what proper competition looked like. I didn't have

41:35.240 --> 41:42.040
a formula for proper competition. Guys, if you don't know what to look, what, what, um, metrics

41:42.040 --> 41:47.640
to look at, if you don't know what a good area looks like, you, you can't even do this business

41:47.640 --> 41:55.080
model. Like my, the training I first got, it taught me a lot of basics. It taught me so many good

41:55.080 --> 42:00.360
things and I, I, I spent $8,000 on it. I made a lot of money from it because I taught me things

42:00.360 --> 42:05.000
I had to learn. I had to learn how to do content. I had all these different things,

42:05.000 --> 42:11.160
but I'm going to be honest, the due diligence process, the competition, you know, assessment

42:11.160 --> 42:16.120
part, it was terrible. It was absolutely terrible. It didn't teach me this. So yeah,

42:16.120 --> 42:21.160
it's completely changed and I learned it through trial and error. So, um, basically how it's

42:21.160 --> 42:28.520
changed is, is I now look at age of domain content, backlinks, and then CPC is something

42:28.520 --> 42:33.400
that I can't believe I never looked at. Like, and the reason why guys is the higher the CPC,

42:33.960 --> 42:37.960
typically the more competitive it is. And if you're not, and the other thing is if you're

42:37.960 --> 42:42.440
not looking at CPC, you're crazy because let's just say that winter comes and things dry up or

42:42.440 --> 42:48.040
things slow down or your website, heaven forbid gets, gets pushed to page two or page three for,

42:48.040 --> 42:53.160
for some weird Google update. I want to make sure that if I kick on ads tomorrow to supplement,

42:53.160 --> 42:58.040
I'm not going to lose my shorts. So that, I mean, the other before I wasn't even thinking

42:58.040 --> 43:02.440
about CPC. Now it's a, it's a huge metric that I look at. So anyway, keep going.

43:04.280 --> 43:10.520
Yeah, yeah, for sure. Um, so Chris asks, what are your ballparking,

43:10.520 --> 43:13.640
what are you ballparking for CPC, um, for the UK?

43:15.640 --> 43:21.160
Um, I've never done CPC in the UK, but my, what I would tell you is, you know, obviously less

43:21.160 --> 43:24.920
than $5 because that's what you do in the US, but I would, I would say that you could probably

43:24.920 --> 43:30.840
safely do less than you could probably shave a dollar, maybe a dollar 50 off, because I know

43:30.840 --> 43:36.760
that it's not as competitive. Um, but if you want to be ultra safe, then I would do less than $5

43:37.960 --> 43:40.520
in the UK. Just to say,

43:42.520 --> 43:48.200
if he's using the pounds. Oh, what is pounds? Yeah, just convert it. I don't know. I'll tell

43:48.200 --> 43:52.920
you right now. Yeah, just, just convert it, Chris. Five USD, two pounds.

43:57.320 --> 44:06.760
3.85. So anything 3.85 or less, 3.85 pounds or less per click. You're good to go.

44:07.480 --> 44:10.840
Cool. Swing. Yeah, no problem. Thanks man. Good question.

44:10.840 --> 44:19.880
Uh, let's see, uh, Salim, uh, you said you have a tree service site in San Jose. Nick was talking

44:19.880 --> 44:24.680
about St. George, Utah. I think you're talking about San Jose, California. So completely different

44:24.680 --> 44:29.960
areas. We actually don't even recommend going into California, to be honest. Don't do it.

44:30.520 --> 44:35.160
Don't do it again. This is just coming from experience. I'm like that old grandpa. That's

44:35.160 --> 44:39.560
like, you know, that gives you that wisdom. And they're like, yeah, when I was a kid and you think

44:39.560 --> 44:43.000
they're full of crap and tell you like, go and try it. And they're like, Oh, grandpa was right.

44:44.920 --> 44:52.520
Don't do California, man. I feel exhausted. Like I, I don't even have energy to like really talk

44:52.520 --> 44:54.760
about it because we talked about it. I have a YouTube video about it.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.680
There's too much money out there to be wasted time in California.

45:01.240 --> 45:08.200
Yeah, for sure. Uh, Shane Noble says, Nick, do you use SEO Quake for content?

45:08.200 --> 45:15.000
Where do you get CPC metrics or the keyword planner? CPC, I've always used SEMrush.

45:17.320 --> 45:21.320
However, I think if you've been on my last two, cause you're, he's an indigenous landlord.

45:22.520 --> 45:29.000
The last two weeks, I've kind of talked about it is we've been working for the last year on

45:29.000 --> 45:35.480
putting something together. That's going to be our like go-to golden standard thing. I've put

45:35.480 --> 45:43.080
over, we put over $50,000 into this thing and we're testing it right now. Um, so for right now,

45:43.080 --> 45:49.000
until I show you what I'm talking about, you could use SEMrush. Um, that's what we usually,

45:49.000 --> 45:51.800
that's typically what I'm referring to. That's what I've used in the past.

45:54.360 --> 46:00.760
Yeah, I'm excited for that. Uh, Saleem says, do you suggest using EMD or going, uh,

46:00.760 --> 46:04.760
some other relevant names for domain name? Okay. So for those that don't know what he means

46:04.760 --> 46:12.120
about EMD is exact match domain. Um, you know, St. George concrete, St. George plumbing, whatever

46:12.120 --> 46:20.360
Las Vegas concrete or concrete Las Vegas. Um, yeah, I don't, I try to get it in, but you know,

46:20.360 --> 46:25.560
I don't stress a bunch. So like I do, I still try to get it in. So if I, I always look at,

46:26.600 --> 46:30.840
you know, Las Vegas concrete, second option would be concrete Las Vegas. Third option would be,

46:31.720 --> 46:39.240
uh, concrete hyphen Las Vegas. Uh, then it would probably be concrete hyphen

46:39.960 --> 46:45.800
loss hyphen vague. I try to keep it in, but I don't think it ultimately is that big of a factor

46:45.800 --> 46:50.840
that again, guys, if you look, if you find a city that's low hanging fruit and you do the due

46:50.840 --> 46:57.880
diligence and it's not competitive, that isn't that technically Google says that exact match domain

46:58.840 --> 47:04.920
isn't a factor anymore, but I don't agree. I think it does matter a little bit. And so if you're

47:04.920 --> 47:10.600
going into a highly competitive area, all the tiny things matter, but if you're going into an area

47:10.600 --> 47:16.760
that's not competitive, you can get away with a lot. So my, my recommendation is spend the time

47:16.760 --> 47:22.200
to find a low hanging fruit area, find one of those telltale signs, those map listings without

47:22.200 --> 47:27.160
a website. And then guess what? The exact match domain doesn't really matter. Okay. But technically

47:27.240 --> 47:31.000
Google says it doesn't matter. I still try to get it, but I don't, I'm not too fussy about it.

47:31.000 --> 47:35.480
I don't have to have an exact match domain, but I do try to get at least the keyword in, at least

47:35.480 --> 47:43.240
the city without making it look spammy. Yep. Yeah, for sure. Um, and then she noble says,

47:43.240 --> 47:51.000
have you done any YouTube on CPC? Um, I'm going to write this down. I was going to just think

47:51.000 --> 47:57.400
about making a YouTube on exact match. Um, CPC, I don't know if I've done it too much on that,

47:58.120 --> 48:03.960
but I can Shane. That's a good, that's a good suggestion. I can make a video on CPC. In fact,

48:04.760 --> 48:10.600
what I'd like you to do, Shane, send me a DM with Jason or Donnie Drake. He's also, he's got two

48:10.600 --> 48:16.200
names. Um, send us a DM with your exact question related to CPC. I'll make a YouTube video this

48:16.200 --> 48:20.520
week. I'll post it and I'll send it to you, uh, directly to answer your question and also be able

48:20.520 --> 48:25.640
to, um, have it as a good, you know, piece of information for anyone else has a question.

48:27.160 --> 48:32.600
Also Shane, uh, you're, you're part of digital landlords. Um, I feel like Nick goes over that

48:32.600 --> 48:36.200
pretty well in the training. If you need to go through and review the training or ask people

48:36.200 --> 48:41.880
in the paid group, um, you know, people can help you out there too. So, and also by the way,

48:42.120 --> 48:46.600
I'm going to cover this tomorrow on digital. We're actually doing, we're rehauling the whole

48:46.600 --> 48:51.800
training on ads, which is exciting. I'm pretty pumped about that. But, um, so yeah, Shane,

48:51.800 --> 48:55.160
that's what I would do. I'm happy to make a YouTube video about it. Number one, number two,

48:55.160 --> 49:01.720
like you said, I know this, we've covered it in, in detail, um, in the training and also in the

49:01.720 --> 49:06.680
different threads within the group. Um, but yeah, and you could also ask that question to digital

49:06.680 --> 49:09.800
landlords. And then me and, um, Jason can go answer it there as well.

49:12.120 --> 49:19.320
Yeah. Um, we got, we got one more, I think, uh, Joel, on average, how long has it taken you to

49:19.320 --> 49:25.720
rank aside with ads in a low competition area? Um, have you already screenshot this that people

49:25.720 --> 49:29.880
are on by the way? No, I haven't. You should be done really quick and I'll answer this. We can

49:29.880 --> 49:34.440
hop off to screenshot everyone with their name. And anyone's on this call is going to get a DM

49:34.440 --> 49:40.520
from, uh, Donnie Dre, which is Jason. He's going to DM you the digital resource that we create from

49:40.520 --> 49:45.560
this call. So appreciate you guys being on. Um, this is, I guess my gift to you for just being on

49:45.560 --> 49:51.240
and then you'd have to take a bunch of notes and, uh, we're going to create that today. Um, average

49:51.240 --> 49:58.040
for me, if I do good research is, is four to six months. Um, but there's always anomalies. There's

49:58.040 --> 50:01.720
always times you go in and you surprise yourself and you get something to rank. I've had stuff

50:01.800 --> 50:06.200
rank in a month. I've also had stuff that looked like everything else and it took me nine months.

50:06.760 --> 50:10.040
So you can only control what you can control. But guess what? The beautiful thing is,

50:10.040 --> 50:15.720
is if you're running ads, you're making money the entire freaking time. And so you don't sit

50:15.720 --> 50:18.920
there and obsessing, not sitting there. Oh, where am I ranked? Where am I ranked? Where am I? Right?

50:18.920 --> 50:22.680
Where's the lead? You don't even worry guys. You just go and you make money and you get the next

50:22.680 --> 50:25.480
one, you get the next one, you get the next one. And the thing I love about it, like Jason, for

50:25.480 --> 50:32.760
example, you know, he's making 14 grand a month, but his margins, because he's running ads to keep,

50:32.760 --> 50:37.800
I'm guessing most of those afloat, his margin is the lowest it's ever going to be. Let's say it's

50:37.800 --> 50:41.800
50% right now because he's spent, he's got some that are ranking. He's got a lot of these doing

50:41.800 --> 50:48.280
ads for, let's just say he's making 7,000 net. It's the lowest it's going to be. And what he's

50:48.280 --> 50:51.640
going to realize if he hasn't already is he's going to look at that. He's going to sit down one day

50:51.640 --> 50:56.440
and go, oh my gosh, if I just focus on SEO, if I just focus on getting this rank so I can turn off

50:56.440 --> 51:03.080
ads, I can go from making 7,000 in my pocket to making 12,000 in my pocket. And that's like the

51:03.080 --> 51:06.440
coolest thing because you don't have to call any business owners. You just have to focus on

51:06.440 --> 51:12.520
technical stuff, which is the easy part. And you can make $5,000 more per month in your pocket,

51:12.520 --> 51:17.240
which is what a lot of people get paid per year at their job. So yeah, for sure.

51:18.040 --> 51:23.800
One thing I noticed too is like, I'm just focusing on just getting that next deal,

51:23.800 --> 51:27.720
hooking the next business owner. And the next thing I know a lead comes in organically and I'm

51:27.720 --> 51:32.680
like, Hey, this isn't from the ads. I go take a look and this guy's number two on Google already.

51:32.680 --> 51:38.360
I have three or four guys who are already at the top of Google without adding a single backlink,

51:38.360 --> 51:43.320
to be honest. So just let it do its thing and focus on closing the next deal.

51:43.560 --> 51:48.840
And that means Jason, that you did really good due diligence. If you're ranking without backlinks,

51:48.840 --> 51:53.960
that's because you did a really good due diligence. So that's the truth. Guys,

51:53.960 --> 52:00.120
thanks for being on the call as always. And guys, hopefully you guys listen to what Jason's saying.

52:01.000 --> 52:05.880
Jason, for those that didn't hear this, it started in January, just like this year.

52:06.760 --> 52:10.920
He's already at 14,000. This works for everybody. If you follow the process,

52:10.920 --> 52:14.840
it works for everybody. And so when he's in there as Donnie Dre, if he's given advice,

52:14.840 --> 52:20.120
he's actually doing this. That's kind of a rule. If somebody's on my team, they have to be doing

52:20.120 --> 52:25.160
the business model. They have to have already closed deals. Because if not, imagine Jason's

52:25.160 --> 52:31.960
on this call and he's just speaking from theory. So anyway, if you guys see his post, know that

52:31.960 --> 52:36.120
he knows what he's doing. But that said, guys, thank you so much. We'll see you guys inside the

52:36.120 --> 52:40.600
free group and we'll see you next week. Thanks, Jason. See you guys.
