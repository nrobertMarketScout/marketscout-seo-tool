01:14.320 --> 01:20.400
little bit of inspiration so congrats on that but back to what i was saying last week ryan

01:20.400 --> 01:27.840
dalton came on the call he's created a go-to tool for uh for literally specifically for rank and rent

01:27.840 --> 01:32.000
for digital real estate it's not built for sto agencies it's not built for

01:32.000 --> 01:37.920
smma it's not built for all these different it's literally for rank and rent that's it for digital

01:37.920 --> 01:45.600
real estate done which limits the market size for him but makes a very very custom and specific

01:45.600 --> 01:50.800
tool for us so we've been for a long time people have been asking what's the minimum search volume

01:51.680 --> 01:57.360
on the last call we discussed that that uh minimum search volume so if you guys didn't see that go i

01:57.360 --> 02:01.760
don't want to rob you of watching that live it's a really good live and there's some context in there

02:01.760 --> 02:05.280
i can't just give you a direct black and white answer we did give a black and white answer with

02:05.280 --> 02:10.560
like a little bit of a grain of salt um that you need to watch the entire live so go watch last

02:10.560 --> 02:15.440
week's live if you guys are wondering what's if you guys are wondering when i'm searching search

02:15.440 --> 02:19.520
volume on a specific city and niche what's the minimum that it needs to show for me to have

02:19.520 --> 02:23.680
confidence to go into it we've been playing with the tool we've been testing it i've been looking

02:23.680 --> 02:28.560
at i think i looked at five or six different projects that are ranking really well and in

02:28.560 --> 02:35.440
order to be able to say hey uh this is the definitive answer for how many searches right now

02:35.440 --> 02:41.200
in 2024 november you need to go forward with confidence that could change at the beginning

02:41.200 --> 02:46.160
of the year i'm going to try to continually uh keep you guys with you know up to date fresh

02:46.160 --> 02:51.520
whatever but if you guys didn't see it live i highly recommend you checking that out also there

02:51.520 --> 02:59.040
was a code that we gave away for for a deal on that and if you watch the last live you can get

02:59.040 --> 03:03.120
that okay i'm not going to talk a lot about it on this stream um just wanted to let you guys know

03:03.120 --> 03:06.960
that we did cover that last time so porter jason you guys can still hear me right

03:09.520 --> 03:17.360
beautiful okay so what i want to do today guys is um i i want to talk we've had porter on we've

03:17.360 --> 03:23.120
had jason on they've been on in the free group they've been on in here you guys have probably

03:23.120 --> 03:30.640
seen their names um so real quick so first of all porter you're at 9400 right yeah 9400

03:31.600 --> 03:42.720
okay jason what are you at uh 14400 14400 okay i love that you're inching away from porter dude

03:42.720 --> 03:51.200
keep going jason better slow down no i have slowed down that's you know i it should be a

03:51.200 --> 03:54.880
lot higher i i ignored a lot of nick's advice in the past and so it's time to get back and

03:55.840 --> 04:03.520
get those deals closed so it's interesting uh on that point guys uh when you if you what jason

04:03.520 --> 04:09.280
and porter could probably testify to this when you get into this program if you will just follow

04:09.280 --> 04:15.840
what we talk about to a t to a freaking t if we say five dollar cpc that means if it's five

04:15.840 --> 04:21.040
dollars and five cents it's a no if we say that the search volume needs to be this if it's anything

04:21.120 --> 04:26.640
less it's a no if we say you need to look for this if we say that go go into these states whatever

04:26.640 --> 04:30.480
and you'll just follow it to a t you'll follow the script to a t to the point you almost sound like

04:30.480 --> 04:39.120
a robot it's amazing that you will get dill you will get deals and even when i first started

04:39.120 --> 04:44.400
doing this back in 2016 i i was so dumb at this that i had no other option except for to follow

04:44.400 --> 04:49.920
it and what always happens is people get in and the ones that follow it to a t they get deals they

04:49.920 --> 04:53.840
follow they they they really follow the due diligence they go through enough they go into

04:53.840 --> 04:58.720
the right niche the right city the right search volume the right cpc they they're not sending

04:58.720 --> 05:04.400
too many leads they're saying the right things they get a deal and what always happens this is

05:04.400 --> 05:08.960
very common is then sometimes you'll get one two three four five maybe you even get to 10k

05:08.960 --> 05:14.720
and then you forget the little things you skip these minor things and porter and jason i don't

05:14.720 --> 05:19.040
know jason it's what your the hints that you're dropping make it sound like that might be your

05:19.040 --> 05:24.400
case as well but i know porter in the last uh is it in the last week porter you've lost

05:24.400 --> 05:29.440
an additional two deals that could have put you around like 12 000 yeah two deals

05:31.200 --> 05:36.000
nothing like losing two deals in a week so and i just want you guys to know this is very very

05:36.000 --> 05:41.200
common this happens in sales too when i was doing door to door i got my first deal i followed the

05:41.200 --> 05:45.040
process i did the pitch and i got my first deal then i got my second deal they got my third

05:45.040 --> 05:52.080
guys i got 10 or no i got 17 deals before i even started my first summer and then my very first

05:52.080 --> 05:59.040
week i went out and i like just decided to say extra stuff and skip steps and i didn't sell for

05:59.040 --> 06:05.280
two days i moved my wife and my pregnant wife at the time across the country we bought like

06:05.840 --> 06:10.640
500 worth of stuff to like furnish our apartment we signed a lease on our apartment we're there

06:10.640 --> 06:14.640
for five months four months whatever and i didn't sell for two days and i was like what the

06:14.640 --> 06:20.000
heck's going on went back to the drawing board and sure enough i was skipping steps or and or

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
sometimes you're adding things that don't need to be added you're giving too much information

06:24.000 --> 06:29.840
so um let's first jason and porter i want to talk about how you got to 10k and then i

06:29.840 --> 06:34.480
want to talk about like some of the the mistakes you've made along the way the skipping the steps

06:34.480 --> 06:43.040
etc so how why is it that you guys are at we're going to say porter i know you're a little bit

06:43.040 --> 06:48.640
under 10k but just so i don't have to like you know say it and be cumbersome about it you guys

06:48.640 --> 06:56.240
are 10k roughly uh jason's at basically at 15 or 14k um why is it that porter you're there

06:56.240 --> 07:03.040
jason you're there and we see people that come in to this same exact program same exact training

07:03.040 --> 07:11.760
same exact 24 hours in a day and they don't have any deals why do you and i i know you guys not the

07:11.760 --> 07:17.680
interesting the thing about porter and jason not only are they at 10k plus but they're also helping

07:17.680 --> 07:21.760
a lot in the free group and in the discord which means they get a very interesting perspective

07:21.760 --> 07:27.280
because they're talking to some of you guys that have even joined to initially talk to them and

07:27.280 --> 07:31.280
ask them questions so i want to start with you porter and then i want to go to you jason but

07:31.280 --> 07:40.160
why do you think you're at 9-4 and there's people that have been in here twice as long or as long

07:40.160 --> 07:44.720
and have zero money coming in what what do you think what's what's your response to that

07:46.080 --> 07:52.240
i think they're they're overthinking it i think you you get worried about what tool to use and

07:52.240 --> 07:58.480
everything needs to be exactly perfect in in the setup and you're afraid to make calls because

07:58.960 --> 08:03.920
it's not a quiet space or your zoom call you've only sent him two leads or three leads and you

08:03.920 --> 08:10.160
feel like there's like a perfect point to close your deal there are so many people that are like

08:10.160 --> 08:14.240
i just don't know or people that are over complicating the niches that i've talked to

08:14.240 --> 08:18.720
people that they're they don't they don't pick one niche and try to get like five or six deals

08:18.720 --> 08:23.440
they try to go into these other niches that we haven't recommended and they're just going off

08:23.440 --> 08:27.520
course just enough to not let them get the deal but i think the biggest thing is just overthinking

08:27.520 --> 08:34.560
it okay i don't disagree i'm going to let jace answer that i'm going to weigh in on my comments

08:35.760 --> 08:39.120
jason what do you think i was actually going to say what what porter was going to say

08:39.120 --> 08:42.080
um i think people are overthinking it quite a bit um

08:43.200 --> 08:47.200
uh it's what it's doing is it's stopping you from just taking that imperfect action

08:47.200 --> 08:58.480
um

08:58.480 --> 09:01.760
it doesn't matter if you got one lead in two weeks still make the phone call and get that business

09:01.760 --> 09:06.720
owner the hook is you can always increase your app and if you have to after the deal is closed

09:06.720 --> 09:13.520
but get a business owner on the hook get him closed and uh not everything has to be perfected

09:13.520 --> 09:21.680
like what is in the training um does that make sense yeah 100 and i know i i got i cut out just

09:21.680 --> 09:26.960
a little bit i could you could you hear jason the whole time porter yeah he was good okay so i was

09:26.960 --> 09:31.840
a little so i just want to make sure the stream is going good um yeah 100 i agree it's like

09:34.400 --> 09:39.600
i don't know where i heard this uh i think i don't know i don't know what podcast i i haven't read

09:39.600 --> 09:44.080
that many books lately but they they talked about there was like an assignment that i'm

09:44.080 --> 09:47.520
probably butchering this but there was this assignment given there was like a it was like

09:47.520 --> 09:55.200
a study and they took like this college class and half of the group they said uh i can't they

09:55.200 --> 09:59.040
they gave them like an assignment for a project and i can't even remember what industry whatever

09:59.040 --> 10:04.080
it was i don't even know if this is music or art whatever and then the other group so the one half

10:04.080 --> 10:11.760
of the group of the class they said you get to do as many projects as you want you can put out

10:11.760 --> 10:16.240
as many pieces as you want and then at the end of the year we're gonna see who has the best piece

10:16.240 --> 10:21.680
out of everybody and the other group they said you need to create the perfect piece you get one

10:21.680 --> 10:27.680
chance at it and you just need to perfect that one piece of whatever it was art music i can't

10:27.680 --> 10:36.000
even remember the the context and they took the two groups and the group that literally kept

10:36.000 --> 10:41.280
putting out pieces and they had you know maybe instead of one project they had 15 or they had

10:41.280 --> 10:47.440
20 it they did their projects were so much better their best their best of their best was so much

10:47.440 --> 10:53.760
better than this person that did one project their best point being guys is that in this business

10:53.760 --> 10:57.520
it's an art not a science and you have to you have to do the reps and you're going to make

10:57.520 --> 11:02.800
mistakes and you're gonna have to like lose deals porter's lost two deals in the last week right

11:02.800 --> 11:08.320
some of you guys haven't even lost a deal because you're too scared to pick up the phone and porter

11:08.320 --> 11:11.920
is probably learned something i know because we talked about he probably learned something on the

11:11.920 --> 11:19.200
last one that he lost that will cause him to never lose that type of a deal again but you have to

11:19.280 --> 11:25.440
just go through those mistakes so it's yeah i don't want to like i swear sometimes it's the

11:25.440 --> 11:29.600
people that are the the most simple-minded that do the best in this business because

11:29.600 --> 11:33.520
they're not overthinking it i'm not saying that we're stupid we're just very simple-minded

11:36.000 --> 11:40.960
thoughts on you agree i mean jason's wearing a byu hoodie um porter's in

11:42.080 --> 11:45.520
so we're not no one's accusing us of hitting that high you know

11:49.920 --> 11:54.720
no i totally agree i think oh sorry jason you can go no you're good porter go ahead

11:55.440 --> 12:01.360
no i was just saying it's so true i do feel like i talked to another guy because i'm in discord

12:01.360 --> 12:06.000
a lot and i talked to a guy and he was like trying to set up these animations he was wanting to like

12:06.000 --> 12:11.440
he's like i'm almost ready to start making calls and like he had gotten like four or five leaves

12:12.160 --> 12:15.600
before and he still hasn't even called the business owner and i was like dude if i like

12:16.080 --> 12:20.720
dude if i like even before you get a glee like you should be calling getting on the phone

12:20.720 --> 12:25.040
and i was like you're just overthinking it like it was just like this for whatever reason getting

12:25.040 --> 12:29.760
on the phone is like the scariest part which i get but like that's where you're gonna make the

12:29.760 --> 12:37.760
money and i think if we could just get over that part of it man we'd be so no fear of like being

12:37.760 --> 12:43.680
told no we'd be way higher than we were what do you think are the biggest things people are

12:43.680 --> 12:47.520
overthinking because guys i hope for those of you that are watching this right now that

12:47.520 --> 12:51.120
don't have your first deal that it's been a while since you got your deal that you're not close to

12:51.120 --> 12:58.000
10k and you're sitting here listening to three people that have hit 10k like we're no different

12:58.000 --> 13:03.840
than you period and some of you guys everyone's gonna say oh porter has this that i don't have

13:03.840 --> 13:10.400
or jason has this or i promise you that like porter doesn't have sales experience how come

13:10.400 --> 13:17.520
he's at 10k uh you know whatever there's like stephanie who just got her deal that 250 bucks

13:17.520 --> 13:22.320
a week i know there's women in the group that go well yeah but he's a man and i'm a woman right

13:22.320 --> 13:26.000
and they think that's so whatever your little thing is that you think is the reason that's

13:26.000 --> 13:32.640
stopping you is not actually stopping you so i'm curious what you guys think after getting to 10k

13:32.640 --> 13:38.720
also talking to literally you guys are having conversations with hundreds of people per week

13:38.720 --> 13:42.320
as you guys help at our internal team and discord and in the facebook group

13:42.880 --> 13:47.360
and then you see a percentage of those people come into here what do you think are the things

13:47.360 --> 13:54.000
that people overthink the most let's start with jason you want to go first all right there's two

13:54.000 --> 13:59.840
things that i have noticed the most one of them is people don't want to put in the work to actually

13:59.840 --> 14:05.040
vet the business owner and they want to focus more on organic and the reason you joined this

14:05.040 --> 14:11.600
program is to pre-sell so organic it obviously that's the long-term goal because we want to build

14:11.600 --> 14:17.360
that digital asset but i have seen some people want to avoid actually just going through the

14:17.360 --> 14:22.560
sales process and they want to try and rank a website organically the other thing i've seen

14:22.560 --> 14:27.200
well hold on do you think that is sorry to cut you off do you think that's because

14:27.760 --> 14:31.280
they believe that that's the better way or because they're trying to avoid the one thing

14:31.280 --> 14:34.400
that's actually going to make them money that's scary called it's called cold calling

14:35.680 --> 14:41.120
i think they're trying to avoid picking up the phone and calling yeah and if you're ranking

14:41.120 --> 14:46.880
a website then you can sit there and and in your mind be like i'm doing work which technically you

14:46.880 --> 14:52.160
are but you're not doing needle moving work you could literally be making money but instead

14:52.160 --> 14:56.640
you're able to sit there go well i did backlinks today cool bro but that didn't get you any closer

14:56.640 --> 14:59.680
to the money you could go get the deal today and make the money so i just want to clarify that

15:00.240 --> 15:07.520
um second thing is what now the second thing is i have talked to several people who do come from

15:07.520 --> 15:12.720
a sales background and they're not afraid to pick up the phone but they expect their campaign to

15:12.720 --> 15:19.920
be forming like four or five weeks a week when that's not necessary um if you're getting leads

15:19.920 --> 15:24.000
then you need to pick up the phone and call and so they're expecting their campaign to performing

15:24.000 --> 15:28.880
like just you know especially we got the holidays around the corner so your leads are going to be

15:28.880 --> 15:35.200
a little bit slower than usual and so i think what they're doing is they're expecting just a

15:35.200 --> 15:42.160
consistent lead flow in order to close a deal at a max price when that's not necessary you're going

15:42.160 --> 15:46.080
to give that business owner a trial of just a handful of free leads you're not telling him how

15:46.080 --> 15:50.320
many leads you're getting him you're not telling them how quick those leads are coming in um you're

15:50.320 --> 15:56.160
just giving him a handful for free to let him you know taste and see what the value has to offer

15:56.160 --> 16:00.000
and then you're going to close him you need to increase your ad spend during the winter months

16:00.000 --> 16:02.480
that's cool but it doesn't have to be perfect

16:04.560 --> 16:08.480
order what do you think people are overthinking the most and by the way corey gilbert i see your

16:08.480 --> 16:12.000
question we're going to get to you in just a moment but porter what do you think uh in terms

16:12.000 --> 16:17.920
of people what do you think people overthink the most with this business i think it's just

16:17.920 --> 16:23.600
the beginning too is the the even just the due diligence part like they they start they have

16:23.600 --> 16:28.240
all these different options of tools mangos semrush uh rare they have all these different

16:28.240 --> 16:34.400
things and they still don't believe that it's five dollars means less like less than five dollars

16:34.400 --> 16:39.680
like i i get on so many calls they're like so is it still five dollars is the seat like is the volume

16:39.680 --> 16:43.920
still there and i'm like like i haven't changed the things from what you've said in the course

16:43.920 --> 16:48.880
like i haven't changed the one thing and i still keep getting deals and so like people just need

16:48.880 --> 16:53.440
to pick a tool understand that like they're not accurate all that's doing is narrowing

16:53.440 --> 16:57.520
100 down to 10 and then you do further due diligence you go with it and at the end of the

16:57.520 --> 17:03.280
day if it doesn't work you just bag the city and pick a new one and you spent an hour building the

17:03.280 --> 17:07.520
one pager but so many people get so caught up with just the starting part it's crazy

17:09.200 --> 17:15.360
yeah and and and we always want to do everything to be perfect i have the most extreme example of

17:15.360 --> 17:18.880
this there was a guy there's a guy in our group right now i'm going to call his name out because

17:18.880 --> 17:25.120
he's it's hilarious and he said it his name is boron he scaled up to like 30 grand like fairly

17:25.120 --> 17:32.720
rapidly and um but when he first started he had been in another like a group a ranking rep group

17:32.720 --> 17:37.760
he didn't know a sales process he was hung up he maybe got a couple deals and then he got in here

17:37.760 --> 17:42.560
and he just started crushing after 30k anyway he ended up i don't i think he's he started like a

17:42.640 --> 17:46.880
franchise and i don't know what how much he's doing with this business anymore which that's

17:46.880 --> 17:51.200
his it's it's his business he's making money it's passive and he decided to go that route that's

17:51.200 --> 17:57.040
cool but i remember when he got on i asked him i said what was your yeah but what was the reason

17:57.040 --> 18:00.720
that you thought that you couldn't do this and what was the thing that was hanging you up

18:01.600 --> 18:07.120
and he's like well i was i always watched your videos and i thought to myself i don't have a

18:07.200 --> 18:15.760
cool background uh like a backdrop i'm just in my room and it's not like cool and i thought he was

18:15.760 --> 18:21.760
joking and he was he was serious he's he legitimately told himself like once i get a

18:21.760 --> 18:28.000
cool background i'll be able to close deals uh that sounds stupid guys but it's so true how many

18:28.000 --> 18:34.880
times you guys watched a video uh let's just say like a workout video right and and you want to

18:34.880 --> 18:38.960
get you want to like get in shape whatever and the person that's doing the video they talk about

18:38.960 --> 18:44.240
maybe like a supplement that they use or some kind of like gym gear that they use and you go

18:44.240 --> 18:49.280
to amazon and you order it and you're like i'm gonna start like once that once it comes as if

18:49.280 --> 18:55.200
you can't get started without that thing guys it's it's literally you just gotta you have to

18:55.200 --> 19:01.920
just start i don't i it's i wish there was like a more sexy answer but you're everyone's overthinking

19:02.240 --> 19:06.560
you you get in you you go to the training you follow the training you pick a boring niche

19:07.120 --> 19:12.080
we gave you the exact search volume updated watch last week's live using rank and run engine

19:12.880 --> 19:17.760
you go through the due diligence yes you might have to do a hundred due diligence to find that

19:17.760 --> 19:23.280
one city i'm sorry that's part of business and guess what you're gonna learn a lot by doing a

19:23.280 --> 19:28.560
hundred of these worksheets now the good news is is if you have rank and run engine it takes you

19:28.560 --> 19:33.200
five seconds to do one of these once you find the competitors but even if you don't do it with

19:33.200 --> 19:37.760
rank and run engine and you're doing it the slow way you still learn so much by looking at all

19:37.760 --> 19:41.360
these websites and picking up on this and picking up on that and you get quick at it and you get

19:41.360 --> 19:47.360
better at it and those hundred due diligence they don't go to waste okay but people like at every

19:47.360 --> 19:52.160
stage of the process you we lose people it's like well i couldn't find a city so i decided not to go

19:52.640 --> 19:59.280
i need to set up ads and i i was gonna have work and i didn't was gonna be able to answer the calls

19:59.280 --> 20:05.680
and it's like guys come on just get started and i mean if porter is making nine thousand four

20:05.680 --> 20:10.480
hundred dollars you can too if jason's making fourteen thousand four hundred dollars you can too

20:10.480 --> 20:16.160
okay it's that if ryan dalton is making eighty seven thousand dollars a month with a full-time

20:16.160 --> 20:23.360
job and kids and a wife and a dog you can too okay so i don't it's hard for me to relate when

20:23.360 --> 20:27.200
people just don't take action but let me answer a couple questions that we're gonna get back into

20:27.200 --> 20:35.360
this interview uh corey gilbert what's up corey gilbert from from saint george utah uh so corey

20:35.360 --> 20:40.800
said help me out on this i've gone through three business owners first one live transferred the

20:40.800 --> 20:45.840
lead then ghosted me okay uh before i even go any further corey one thing i want to mention

20:45.840 --> 20:49.920
and that i think you might want to start doing it would be interesting try the next time you're

20:49.920 --> 20:58.960
doing these cold calls or anything turn on loom turn on vimeo and record yourself okay record

20:58.960 --> 21:02.880
everything that you do so you can critique it guys if you want to make professional money

21:02.880 --> 21:08.480
in this business you have to treat it professionally kobe bryant used to study his freaking jump shot

21:08.480 --> 21:13.200
he used to study his spin move he used to watch hours of game film he was obsessed that's why he

21:13.200 --> 21:19.040
was the best so uh one of the things i did a decent job i recorded quite a bit but you know

21:19.040 --> 21:24.000
how interesting it is for me to go back and find this a random clip that i recorded when i was

21:24.000 --> 21:28.640
trying to pitch somebody back in 2018 when i absolutely sucked it's like the most valuable

21:28.640 --> 21:33.280
thing i wish i would have recorded everything go and record everything so corey gilbert before

21:33.280 --> 21:38.480
i get into it that's just came to my mind go to just get a loom account dude there's get a vimeo

21:38.480 --> 21:44.480
it's completely free every time you do a sale a cold call turn on the camera you can still hold

21:44.480 --> 21:48.400
your phone like this and record your cold calls and then you're gonna have these cold calls that

21:48.400 --> 21:52.240
you didn't do well you can go and dissect you could send on the group you could send to to me

21:52.240 --> 21:55.360
whatever we could dissect them here's where you went wrong whatever that's one thing i would

21:55.360 --> 22:00.000
suggest right off the bat so corey said he's gone through three business owners first one he live

22:00.000 --> 22:04.320
transferred the lead then ghosted that's going to be hard to answer because i didn't hear the call

22:04.320 --> 22:09.360
second business owner was hungry but too far away from the city okay that's fair that's not

22:09.360 --> 22:12.880
really someone that probably should have got the lead anyway i did dd on the city and the

22:12.880 --> 22:17.760
competition was there got a third business owner gave him three leads with a follow-up on thursday

22:17.760 --> 22:22.480
i've gotten four leads in the past three weeks my fear is if i try to put him under contract i won't

22:22.480 --> 22:26.720
have the leads to continue feeding him through the winter should i just close him and hope you

22:27.360 --> 22:32.160
hope leads continue to come up okay i'm gonna answer this really quick and then i'll let jason

22:32.160 --> 22:36.800
report you guys want to weigh in so corey don't let that be a fear all this just comes down to

22:36.800 --> 22:43.280
managing expectations okay you're going to be closing this guy in a time of year right now

22:43.280 --> 22:49.280
still decent there from december 15th to december 31st it does get a little weird in some of the

22:49.280 --> 22:54.080
parts of the country that especially the parts that are getting really cold but um other than

22:54.080 --> 22:59.200
that there's still it's still there's still deals there are still you could get deals during that

22:59.200 --> 23:02.720
time trust me there's still the people that are hungry are hungry and they're hungry year round

23:03.680 --> 23:10.320
but my advice for you is 100 do not don't have that fear always go for the deal you just have

23:10.320 --> 23:14.960
to set the expectations just let the business owner know like look just this is at the close

23:14.960 --> 23:19.520
by the way right just so you know mr business owner we're doing a six month agreement and we're

23:19.520 --> 23:24.320
going to look at this after six months we're going to take the average over six months you know what

23:24.320 --> 23:28.240
december january i can tell you right now and probably even february they're going to be

23:28.240 --> 23:33.520
significantly slower than march april may but we're going to take the average and then guess what

23:33.520 --> 23:38.960
after may june july august september october november all those months are going to be great

23:38.960 --> 23:42.400
as well and we're going to take an average and we're going to see if this is worth it that's why we

23:42.400 --> 23:47.200
do a six month contract but i'm going to tell you right now sir there's going to be uh days we get

23:47.200 --> 23:52.320
two leads there's going to be weeks we get zero leads we might get two leads in december we might

23:52.320 --> 24:00.400
get 40 leads or 30 leads in march but jason uh uh corey uh just get the deal set expectations and

24:00.400 --> 24:04.000
you will not have a problem if you don't set the expectations and you don't let them know

24:04.000 --> 24:08.240
what's about to happen or what could happen yeah you're going to risk a cancel but don't be afraid

24:08.240 --> 24:15.120
of getting these deals when i launched digital landlords we launched it december 1st of 2021

24:15.120 --> 24:19.200
it was the quote unquote worst time to do this because the leads were the hardest to get it was

24:19.200 --> 24:24.800
winter and we had people getting deals left and right because they just they were just going for

24:24.800 --> 24:29.520
it this is like this is not a time to slow down so great question porter jason real quick you

24:29.520 --> 24:33.120
have anything you want to add on that with j with corey's situation and by the way corey shout out

24:33.120 --> 24:39.280
to corey he's being being a student he's he's freaking busting it this guy is not afraid to

24:39.280 --> 24:42.080
get on the phone he's already been through three four business owners he just joined the program

24:42.080 --> 24:45.760
so shout out to corey for taking action but anything you guys want to add jason or porter

24:46.320 --> 24:53.120
yeah uh corey oh sorry go ahead porter no no you're good you're good man okay zoom meetings

24:53.120 --> 24:58.640
um so corey we've talked a little bit about like the deal that i think you're trying to close right

24:58.640 --> 25:04.800
now um i believe it's in spray foam uh the cool thing about spray foam because i have a deal in

25:04.800 --> 25:11.280
spray foam is they don't need as many jobs closed to make a good return on their investment and so

25:12.080 --> 25:19.520
and so you know this guy doesn't need 15 20 leads per month uh so i would say just go and get this

25:19.520 --> 25:24.560
deal closed and do what nick just told you to do just focus on you know the average of the next

25:24.560 --> 25:29.600
six months because as long as this guy is closing jobs he's going to be happy and just make sure

25:29.600 --> 25:34.080
that he understands the expectation coming into the holidays and stuff like that and then with

25:34.080 --> 25:41.440
your first one when i transfer a lead and i get ghosted then one thing i like to do is i like to

25:41.440 --> 25:46.480
follow up with that lead and just ask the homeowner hey did that business owner contact you about your

25:46.480 --> 25:51.200
estimate oh no he didn't okay cool so that way you can still salvage that lead and send it to

25:51.200 --> 25:57.440
somebody else um so you might be able to save that first lead that you transferred um might be worth

25:57.440 --> 26:00.800
a shot but that's what i have good point good point porter you got anything you want to add

26:00.800 --> 26:06.720
or any advice for quarry yeah i would do two parts i would never say hey you're gonna get

26:06.720 --> 26:11.680
x amount of leads i lost a couple of deals when i first started out because they kept asking me like

26:11.680 --> 26:17.280
hey like how many leads can you guarantee me and of course i'm like nervous i'll be like oh 15

26:17.840 --> 26:22.720
and then i don't get 15 and then they get mad at me the next month and they're like dude you only

26:22.720 --> 26:28.160
sent me 10 leads and i'm like well dude it's the winter time like but but i didn't say that before

26:28.160 --> 26:33.040
it came up and so now they think i'm like dodging them or whatever so never say an exact number just

26:33.040 --> 26:37.520
say hey it's going to be slower in the winter you know that but in the but in the summer we've

26:37.520 --> 26:40.800
already talked about that you're going to make up way more i'm not going to be knocking at your door

26:40.800 --> 26:45.840
asking for more money like is this going to be slower the second thing is and i believe this is

26:45.840 --> 26:50.960
why i've lost two deals in the last week is because my screencast i don't think and it could have been

26:50.960 --> 26:54.240
other things it could have been the way i was explaining it but i don't think i was excited

26:54.240 --> 26:59.920
about my screencast i feel like i was pretty monotone and i think i was also i wasn't explaining

26:59.920 --> 27:04.560
it good enough i wasn't low balling and saying hey at worst case scenario if i only send you

27:04.560 --> 27:10.400
x amount of leads say i sent you five or six leads at this price the average price you're

27:10.400 --> 27:15.280
going to be making x amount of money and i don't think i was explaining it good enough to make

27:15.280 --> 27:19.600
him feel like hey this is worth it to me because most of these business owners they don't know how

27:19.600 --> 27:25.680
to sell they're not as confident in their selling ability to go in and say hey i can close 10 out

27:25.680 --> 27:29.440
of 10 deals they're probably like oh i can close two out of 10 and if you only say hey i'm sending

27:29.440 --> 27:33.840
you 10 leads well that just doesn't make sense for them so you just have to make sure hey a worst

27:33.840 --> 27:41.600
case scenario the slowest time of the year you're going to make this a lot more apt to buy from you

27:41.600 --> 27:49.680
than if you don't just expectations guys i've uh i've i've got deal i've got a deal right now

27:49.680 --> 27:53.760
that we've been sending the guy like he's been paying us three thousand dollars a month for

27:55.120 --> 28:01.280
years and the amount of it's actually it started out in spray foam insulation and it transitioned

28:01.280 --> 28:07.040
to gutter installation because he kind of changed industries and we don't send him that many leads

28:07.040 --> 28:11.360
but we set the expectation up front that it wasn't going to be that many leads that he had to

28:11.360 --> 28:15.520
squeeze every lead for what it's worth and he does a really good job and we don't send him that

28:15.520 --> 28:19.280
many leads so it really really comes out of expectations so anyway hopefully that answers

28:19.280 --> 28:24.720
your question corey let's go through one or two more then we'll continue on with this yeah i need

28:24.720 --> 28:29.360
to drop a campaign to move on been going for four weeks also on that note corey i wouldn't be running

28:29.360 --> 28:34.640
too many what i would do is i would have maybe three campaigns set up if you want when one of

28:34.640 --> 28:39.200
them's taking off shut the other two pause them and just focus on the one so that you're not

28:39.200 --> 28:43.920
somebody that's chasing multiple rabbits and you catch none that's what i would do once you get a

28:43.920 --> 28:48.080
few deals under your belt and you can learn to manage them then it's okay like at one point

28:48.080 --> 28:52.240
when we were scaling in 2020 we had we would always have like five campaigns going keep in

28:52.240 --> 28:56.800
mind though i had somebody that was calling the leads and answering the phone calls and transferring

28:56.800 --> 29:00.480
the leads to a business owner i had somebody that was cold calling the business owners and then i

29:00.480 --> 29:05.280
was closing the deal so we had three people doing what you're doing so we had five campaigns going

29:05.280 --> 29:10.320
so i would recommend when you when you're getting that first deal start with the one deal one

29:10.320 --> 29:14.480
campaign once it's taking off pause everything else go off the one close it then the next one

29:14.480 --> 29:18.400
do it again maybe the second or third one you can have two campaigns and then you start building

29:18.400 --> 29:21.920
up from there so i just don't want to see you losing money on campaigns if you can't give it

29:21.920 --> 29:29.440
adequate focus okay isaac chatham says he closes deals with a tarp hanging in my basement freaking

29:29.440 --> 29:36.000
love that i think there's something to be said about just being real and to be honest i think

29:36.000 --> 29:40.560
sometimes when you're real like that dude i can think of a bunch of people shane tarrell he's one

29:40.560 --> 29:44.400
of the guys in our group i think he's making about 15 20 thousand dollars last time i talked to him

29:44.400 --> 29:50.960
he lives in mesquite he like has an office in in it looks like it's like in a basement but the

29:50.960 --> 29:54.400
wall behind him i don't think it's finished it kind of looks like it's like an adobe hut

29:55.280 --> 30:01.200
you know what i mean so don't stress over that if you send the leads up front you sound professional

30:01.200 --> 30:06.240
you sound you know you're talking about you could still get deals but um anyway that's just a funny

30:06.240 --> 30:14.080
thing nonetheless justin hofer i think this is your first call if i'm not mistaken so welcome to

30:14.080 --> 30:18.240
digital landlords my friend he said people procrastinate to avoid the inevitable that's it

30:19.040 --> 30:23.520
that's it you can procrastinate the gym all day long but you're not going to get get that body

30:23.520 --> 30:29.520
until you actually go and start start throwing that weight around okay isaac said what's the best

30:29.520 --> 30:34.160
course of action over the next couple of slow months i want to spend my money wisely until

30:34.160 --> 30:40.720
spring rolls around uh i'm gonna let jason and porter i'm gonna start with jason then go to

30:40.720 --> 30:46.000
porter that i'm gonna answer this this is a great question as winter is upon us and guys i'm not

30:46.000 --> 30:52.080
going to sit here and tell you that that winter is the same as spring it's not right but i'm also

30:52.160 --> 30:57.280
here to tell you that i launched this program and i'm gonna talk the talk because i've always done

30:57.280 --> 31:03.440
that when i launched this program i had these same doubts it was like it was literally the night

31:03.440 --> 31:09.920
before thanksgiving of 2021 i knew that there was a need i knew that people i was getting hit up with

31:09.920 --> 31:14.560
so many questions i knew i needed to start this program but i thought to myself man if you know

31:14.560 --> 31:19.200
my first few students they really have to have success and i thought what what's going to make

31:19.440 --> 31:24.720
the most easy to have success and i had had some slow winters in the past and so i fought with

31:24.720 --> 31:31.120
myself i was like man maybe i should wait three four months wait till it's like prime time and

31:31.120 --> 31:35.360
then i'll go ahead and get this group started people will be getting leads left and right it's

31:35.360 --> 31:39.440
going to be easy and i thought to myself you know what you've always sent it when it comes in your

31:39.440 --> 31:43.360
gut you always go for it even if the timing's not perfect so why would you change now and you

31:43.360 --> 31:49.040
might miss the opportunity now is the time and so i got on the night before thanksgiving in fact

31:49.040 --> 31:56.080
you guys can find that live inside of the art of pre-selling which was you guys yeah it's it's

31:56.080 --> 32:00.480
literally the the day before thanksgiving and i said the next monday we were launching and we're

32:00.480 --> 32:04.400
going to be talking about something and we launched it and it was december 1st and it was also

32:04.400 --> 32:09.680
uh i think that was cyber monday if i'm not mistaken i mean it was the worst timing ever you're

32:09.680 --> 32:14.480
not supposed to do it on a monday so my point is don't take your foot off the gas but with that

32:14.560 --> 32:19.040
said porter jason what is your advice well i'm going to start with porter then i'm going to go

32:19.040 --> 32:23.520
to jason where do you think his exact question says what's the best course of action over the

32:23.520 --> 32:28.320
next couple of quote unquote slow months i want to spend my money wisely until spring rolls around

32:30.240 --> 32:35.680
um i would say with your if you're starting out a new a new niche a new city i think

32:36.480 --> 32:41.600
making sure that the niche is um you're able to do not maybe not the niche but the city that you

32:41.600 --> 32:46.480
pick it's it's warmer than than normal like if you go into concrete you can't really can't go

32:46.480 --> 32:51.760
into like a north dakota or somewhere really really cold where it's really cold or no one's

32:51.760 --> 32:56.880
going to be doing concrete um i think if you're if you're going that route you need to make sure

32:56.880 --> 33:02.480
that the city is really warm um but really i i truly believe it's just the expectations i think

33:02.480 --> 33:06.400
you could close the deal in basically any niche if you explain the expectations and

33:07.360 --> 33:13.200
um you understood what your industry is you know and spray phone or maybe pick in the winter you

33:13.200 --> 33:18.480
you try to focus on more indoor niches spray foam or and that's probably still even cold but stuff

33:18.480 --> 33:26.240
that so seasonal but that i think it really just comes down to just expectations i think you close

33:26.240 --> 33:34.000
the deal anytime of year jason i totally agree um one of the things i've been doing is during

33:34.000 --> 33:39.120
the spring and summer months even into early fall i was going like balls to the wall i had like five

33:39.120 --> 33:44.000
campaigns running at once and then just knowing that the holidays are coming up i kind of just

33:44.000 --> 33:49.120
put my narrowed focus down to like two campaigns um that way i'm not just blowing tons of money

33:49.120 --> 33:52.800
trying to close so many deals because you have to be smart about it we just had the election

33:53.440 --> 33:57.600
but most of my business owners the leads actually started increasing after the election

33:57.600 --> 34:02.800
and so that's a good sign of hope that we can still close deals here during these winter months

34:02.800 --> 34:07.840
and then one thing i've also been doing is i've been doing my pretty like my due diligence

34:07.840 --> 34:13.520
beforehand and so i'm actually setting up some organic sites that are going to be ready to just

34:13.520 --> 34:18.480
pull the trigger once january and february hits and that way i can just start running after those

34:18.480 --> 34:23.760
so even though you like i hope this makes sense but even though you can't run more than two

34:23.760 --> 34:29.600
campaigns let's say get those other campaigns that you know you can pull the trigger on ready to go

34:29.600 --> 34:34.080
so that when you have those two campaigns closed you can just move on to the next and just kind

34:34.080 --> 34:41.920
of have a little bit of a head start yeah uh there's a couple industries that have popped

34:41.920 --> 34:45.440
since the elections i think people finally have some certainty at least with which direction

34:45.440 --> 34:50.560
things are going i know that like crypto has from what i'm not in crypto but i've got some guys here

34:50.560 --> 34:54.000
that are friends that are in crypto they've said it's gone bananas since the election so

34:54.720 --> 35:00.960
i think that's a good point another thing guys is if you have some cities that you're very very very

35:00.960 --> 35:06.480
confident about for example maybe you ran ads in the past you never closed a deal you're doing

35:06.480 --> 35:10.720
something wrong but you're like hey this would be a good spot for an organic website to build it

35:10.720 --> 35:15.440
traditionally rank it and rent it now wouldn't be a bad time to throw up a site and start doing some

35:15.440 --> 35:21.280
seo uh and get that site ranked during some of these slow months but i'll say this guys

35:22.080 --> 35:28.400
there's two types of of there's two uh what's the what's the way to say this there's two trade uh

35:29.520 --> 35:35.920
there's two ways to think about this okay number one is you're the person that's always trying to

35:35.920 --> 35:40.080
time things perfectly right you're like a day trader you're trying to figure out when the

35:40.080 --> 35:42.880
market's good you're trying to figure out when the season's good you're trying to predict when

35:42.880 --> 35:48.880
there's the weather you're trying to basically buy and sell whatever right there's that type

35:48.880 --> 35:53.920
of person and then there's the person that's just consistently taking action that's consistently

35:53.920 --> 36:00.400
always all year all the time taking action making moves and you could there's probably

36:00.400 --> 36:06.560
arguments for both and if you had a crystal ball or you're bill ackman and he's he's somebody that's

36:06.560 --> 36:12.400
on uh wall street that's like really good then maybe you could be the first person but my entire

36:12.400 --> 36:18.800
life my entire career has literally been okay i've got the mindset that i'm gonna take action

36:19.040 --> 36:23.760
all year round that if something comes in my gut to do it i'm gonna do it today because the timing's

36:23.760 --> 36:27.360
never gonna be there and heaven forbid something happens and i was supposed to have that conversation

36:27.360 --> 36:31.600
or make that deal or call that person and it doesn't happen yes i'm gonna get punched in the

36:31.600 --> 36:37.360
face sometimes yes i'm gonna get bruised up but i promise you that that that mentality has served

36:37.360 --> 36:42.560
me so well i would have never ever ever and i doubt anyone i don't know if there's anyone that

36:42.560 --> 36:49.840
could have launched their program at a worst time of year on a worst day guys it was winter

36:49.840 --> 36:56.080
it was a holiday it was a monday it was the bad time of the day i didn't know any of this stuff

36:56.080 --> 37:01.600
i learned this after i'm like dude i did everything wrong right but guess what i did it because i knew

37:01.600 --> 37:06.960
that it was time to do it there were there's but there's also deals that i've i've gone for i've

37:06.960 --> 37:12.960
sent it and i lost the deal because maybe i was i could have waited whatever i truly believe that

37:12.960 --> 37:18.480
if you have the mentality you're always going you're always making offers it's uh it's kind

37:18.480 --> 37:25.600
of like in the stock market when you're you're always buying and then you're slowly your average

37:25.600 --> 37:29.680
cost of what you're actually buying it at is is slowly getting down because you might have made

37:29.680 --> 37:33.760
an investment when the stock was really high and you're like crap that wasn't good but you

37:33.760 --> 37:38.240
continue to buy it as it gets lower and lower and lower your your i think it's called dollar

37:38.240 --> 37:43.280
cost averaging becomes uh lower and lower and lower and so i look at it kind of like that

37:43.280 --> 37:48.880
right i'm always buying real estate i'm always uh looking for deals i'm always looking to get

37:48.880 --> 37:53.360
another i'm just i got my foot on the gas all year round that doesn't mean i'm going to be stupid

37:53.360 --> 37:58.000
i'm not going to go blow a bunch of money in north dakota concrete but i'm going to be strategic and

37:58.000 --> 38:03.760
i'm going to be making moves here's one last thing i want to say everyone else in this space

38:03.760 --> 38:08.320
is not taking action everyone else right now is going on vacation everyone else is going

38:08.320 --> 38:13.920
in like taking a break whatever they're going on the cruise and i'm talking about the marketers

38:13.920 --> 38:19.280
right our our competitors people that are in the space on the business side all the business

38:19.280 --> 38:24.080
owners that you probably don't want to work with are also not very serious about business they're

38:24.160 --> 38:28.480
not doing much they're just take like guys i've called business owners that literally move to

38:28.480 --> 38:32.800
florida and they shut down business for three four months a year that's cool but like that's

38:32.800 --> 38:40.240
not who i want to work with so that one thing is from a perspective is that when you're calling in

38:40.240 --> 38:46.240
in december you're you're really only going to get a hold of the people that are actually hungry

38:46.240 --> 38:52.320
to build their business you're it's like a it's like a it's a it's its own filtration system which

38:52.320 --> 38:57.840
is kind of nice so um anyway just some things to think about at the same time guys let's not

38:57.840 --> 39:04.160
pretend that the leads are as easy to get in december as they are in march or april right

39:04.160 --> 39:09.680
after tax returns that's silly of course not however there's also less competition of marketers

39:09.680 --> 39:16.880
calling etc etc etc so anyway porter anything you got to add yeah one last thing i would just say

39:16.880 --> 39:21.600
don't be so emotional with this you have to kind of have thick skin even if you don't pretend you

39:21.600 --> 39:26.720
do because you're going to get yelled at or say you're a scam or like you shouldn't be doing this

39:26.720 --> 39:30.800
or maybe just people are just hanging up on you and if you take it personally you're never going

39:30.800 --> 39:36.320
to go anywhere i remember i lost a couple deals and i was just so sad i was like dude i don't know

39:36.320 --> 39:39.840
what i'm doing wrong like i'm a terrible salesman like i shouldn't be doing this like i need to do

39:39.840 --> 39:45.280
something else and then it's like it was just the business owners that i was dealing with and it was

39:45.280 --> 39:49.440
how i was nurturing those business owners in the first place had nothing to do with the business

39:49.440 --> 39:54.240
model it was just something that i needed to focus on personally and i'm not perfect at it but like

39:54.240 --> 40:00.480
if i can genuinely like just forget all of the you know the emotional part of it and just say hey

40:00.480 --> 40:06.960
that's business then i do way better i have no fear of loss and i go in i can close the deal and

40:06.960 --> 40:11.760
i it's it's the craziest thing until you do it you'll understand but just don't take it personal

40:12.640 --> 40:19.280
100% okay Aaron just barely informed me that we had a bunch of questions on the post so i'm going

40:19.280 --> 40:23.920
to try and rapid fire some of these we still have a few minutes left and then i'll try to come back

40:23.920 --> 40:28.080
as well to the ones that are in the chat so let's try to get through these really quick i'm probably

40:28.080 --> 40:30.960
just going to take i'm going to choose one of you guys i'm going to have you give your answer make

40:30.960 --> 40:38.960
it short we'll go to the next one okay okay let's see we go let's see what we got here Leanne says

40:39.600 --> 40:43.920
i would love to know typically how long it takes from the time you run ads to the time you land

40:43.920 --> 40:49.120
the client i feel like it's taking me longer than it should thank you Jason ready set go what do you

40:49.120 --> 40:55.920
think okay Leanne there's not really a time frame on this it's kind of hard to tell because i've

40:55.920 --> 41:01.200
closed a business owner in four days i've also gone through 10 different business owners and

41:01.200 --> 41:06.880
finally closed a business owner after three months and so just if your campaign is performing and

41:06.880 --> 41:13.200
it's bringing in leads then don't drop it if everything is the way it should when it comes

41:13.200 --> 41:17.440
producing leads do not drop it whatsoever there's going to be a business owner who's hungry to grow

41:17.440 --> 41:22.000
so just keep on finding business owners whether they're ghosting you or not but yeah that's just

41:22.000 --> 41:27.680
my my advice for that beautiful shane noble says are you guys dealing with multiple niches or

41:27.680 --> 41:34.960
staying in only one for now to scale porter i got five deals in concrete and i've literally started

41:34.960 --> 41:39.760
getting i'm focusing on fencing and i'll probably get another five deals so i think the less niches

41:39.760 --> 41:49.040
and more scaling the better oh okay let's see do we have anything else i don't know that might be

41:49.040 --> 41:55.600
it hold on uh we have more questions want to make sure we didn't miss anything in the original post

41:56.320 --> 42:00.240
okay chris johnson says what was the biggest challenge that helped you go from one deal to

42:00.240 --> 42:08.880
10k um let's see so that's the first question so let's go with porter on that one uh what was the

42:08.880 --> 42:12.880
biggest challenge what was the biggest change that helped you go from one deal to 10k porter

42:12.880 --> 42:18.240
because i know you got a deal and then you kind of got snagged and then you you scaled up now

42:18.240 --> 42:24.080
granted you got 9400 but we're going to call it 10k i would say focusing on this business model

42:24.080 --> 42:27.840
every single day and and i know like we want the freedom to do what we want with this business

42:27.840 --> 42:33.200
model but like you have to always be thinking of like certain or niches or cities or like how can i

42:33.200 --> 42:37.360
you know continually improve this business model because i got a deal and i kind of was like

42:37.360 --> 42:42.240
dragging my feet for find another deal or like there was no urgency and so i just feel like if

42:42.240 --> 42:47.040
you get to that point you just have to take this as more seriously don't treat it as a hobby treat

42:47.040 --> 42:52.800
it as a as like your main gig and you will make deals and you can do that even when you have a

42:52.880 --> 42:58.000
full-time job even if this is your you have a full-time job this can mentally be your your

42:58.000 --> 43:03.760
main thing and the the work is your side hustle and you can mentally be at work or sorry you

43:03.760 --> 43:07.360
can be at work but mentally be thinking about this so i know some of you guys like how can i

43:07.360 --> 43:12.000
do that with a full-time job in the beginning you might have to keep the full-time job and while

43:12.000 --> 43:15.600
you're doing that you're thinking of ideas like guys when i first started doing this this was a

43:15.600 --> 43:20.320
side hustle for me but in my mind it was my main hustle i was knocking doors but i was looking for

43:20.320 --> 43:25.440
opportunities i got my first i got sorry i got my second deal by knocking on the door to sell an

43:25.440 --> 43:29.280
alarm system and it turned into me selling a deal to a waterproofing guy that i had no idea about

43:29.280 --> 43:34.720
the niche right because it was my main my main thing in my mind okay number two of chris johnson's

43:34.720 --> 43:39.600
question says what's standing in the way of you going to 100k what's your roadmap i'm going to

43:39.600 --> 43:48.480
give that to you jason most of us standing in the way is the cash flow and having a team in place to

43:48.480 --> 43:53.760
make so that i'm capable of scaling um i you know i've heard a bunch of different advice from

43:53.760 --> 43:58.640
different people but ryan dalton i think he said you can scale the 20 000 just by yourself but

43:58.640 --> 44:02.720
once you're at that point you have the cash flow to to bring in a team that's capable of helping

44:02.720 --> 44:09.920
you scale 200k i agree i think you could probably even eke your way to 30k by yourself but you're

44:09.920 --> 44:16.080
going to be you're going to be doing everything um yeah and and then yeah that's a that's a good

44:16.080 --> 44:20.960
answer okay next question is i'm going to have both you answer this really quick when will this

44:20.960 --> 44:26.080
be your full-time gig example what monthly recurring revenue number do you need to hit

44:26.080 --> 44:30.160
so that you're profitable enough to focus completely on this business model jason i'm

44:30.160 --> 44:35.440
going to go with you first then i'm going to go with porter this is my full-time gig right now

44:35.440 --> 44:41.760
um i was selling seo before this so you really just need to make sure you have enough to to pay

44:41.760 --> 44:47.040
the bills uh so whatever your overhead cost is to pay rent and stuff like that

44:47.040 --> 44:50.880
that's what you need to be able to go full-time and then just don't hold back from there and you'll

44:50.880 --> 44:59.600
just fine order i don't think this will ever be my full-time like my full-time gig like it is but

44:59.600 --> 45:04.800
it's like mentally it is but like i love farming i think i'll always do farming as long as farming's

45:04.800 --> 45:09.760
around and i mean i think it's just cool because i mean i could probably stop farming and be just

45:09.760 --> 45:15.200
fine but it's more of like a thing that i like doing and that this business model allows me to

45:15.200 --> 45:20.560
do that beautiful and there's two different frames of thought guys i think one thing i've

45:20.560 --> 45:24.000
changed a bit on is in the beginning when i started this i thought everyone had the exact

45:24.000 --> 45:29.680
same mindset as me i thought everyone is like make this as big as possible million dollars a month

45:29.680 --> 45:33.840
and i couldn't i think i was speaking to myself and i think there were a few people that related

45:33.840 --> 45:39.200
to me but then i've realized that like dude people just want to get like i think most of you guys can

45:39.200 --> 45:45.120
relate when i say that most of us just want to go and make enough money to quit our job and then

45:45.120 --> 45:50.080
you know have have another of course we want unlimited money if possible like we want to

45:50.080 --> 45:55.440
have enough to just quit our job and and then be able to spend time doing what we love to do

45:55.440 --> 46:00.240
and that's that's it and for most people a good ten fifteen thousand dollars bottom line in your

46:00.240 --> 46:06.880
pocket most everyone can actually do that and so it's cool because i think jason is like hey he's

46:06.880 --> 46:10.960
in this let's go as big as we can because this is my main thing maybe if i find some other stuff

46:10.960 --> 46:15.520
that i'm interested in i could do that and then porter is going to continue to grow this but his

46:15.520 --> 46:20.080
he's going to just continue to farm and he's going to take over the family farm and and you could do

46:20.080 --> 46:25.760
it you can skin it however you want to skin it which i think is really cool um a couple more

46:27.280 --> 46:32.320
uh justin hofer says in spray foam i'm going to give this to jason because i know he's in spray

46:32.320 --> 46:36.960
foam in spray foam if i can send 10 leads a month is that still worth 1500 dollars

46:39.760 --> 46:46.240
leads per month if your business owner can close deals if your business owner if he kind of struggles

46:46.240 --> 46:51.680
with closing jobs then maybe not but make sure you listen to the way he speaks to the homeowners

46:51.680 --> 46:55.440
on your cold calls and stuff when you transfer the leads make sure that he has the skill sets

46:55.440 --> 47:01.280
to close jobs um but yeah if he can close two jobs a month it should be worth 1500 bucks

47:03.280 --> 47:10.000
definitely and you should be able to get 10 leads a month if you do that if you're getting

47:10.000 --> 47:16.160
five dollars or less cpc and you're and if you get a 1500 dollar deal if you even if you have to you

47:16.160 --> 47:22.400
could if you you could spend half of that 750 bucks a month which is a lot there's no way you're

47:22.400 --> 47:27.840
not going to get at least 10 leads like if you have a decent ad set up proper landing page and

47:27.920 --> 47:36.640
then the website that's very achievable so i i agree okay eladis says will calling with a foreign

47:36.640 --> 47:40.880
number or with skype doesn't show a number to business owners set them off i don't live in the

47:40.880 --> 47:47.840
u.s um i'm going to answer this one because i personally haven't done it but i know my team

47:47.840 --> 47:51.200
has done it and i know that there's people that are in this community that are doing it let me

47:51.200 --> 47:58.640
give you an example i just did a podcast last um in fact i would like to i'll try to let me see

47:58.640 --> 48:03.040
if i can actually find it here in just a second i'll i won't do right the second we did a podcast

48:03.920 --> 48:12.000
me and mike v mike v lives in thailand and all of his deals are in north are sorry in new zealand

48:12.000 --> 48:20.320
and he literally uses a skype number a skype freaking web with connected to wi-fi is how

48:20.320 --> 48:26.800
he cold calls again what these are one of these things like i think if you call and you think it's

48:26.800 --> 48:30.320
weird it's going to be weird to them i also think you can preemptively bring it up and you can say

48:30.320 --> 48:36.000
hey sorry you know this is nick i'm i'm i'm actually traveling right now so that's why my

48:36.000 --> 48:40.240
i'm calling you from like a skype whatever whatever you want to say and just bring it up first

48:40.240 --> 48:44.640
bring up the elephant in the room it's not a big deal dude of course it's internet i'm getting you

48:44.640 --> 48:49.680
leads from internet who cares if i'm in bali you know so that's that's my opinion um was that

48:49.680 --> 48:57.440
porter or jason was gonna say something i don't know it wasn't me what were you gonna say

49:01.360 --> 49:05.280
no it wasn't me i don't know who okay i thought somebody was gonna say something never mind

49:05.280 --> 49:09.040
um okay anyway so yeah that's that's not a huge deal so

49:12.640 --> 49:16.880
it's it guys i i really wish i could get on here and i could bring these guys on or i could bring

49:16.880 --> 49:21.440
anyone else that's got to 10k and i could sit there and be like hey what's the magic bullet

49:21.440 --> 49:26.720
what's the secret sauce what's the whatever but everything that these guys have said are just

49:26.720 --> 49:31.680
tied back into the training that we've given like both of these guys if you haven't picked up on

49:31.680 --> 49:36.080
this are being very very fundamental about how they're handling this business model porter

49:36.640 --> 49:44.720
um and up until now porter are all of your deals in concrete yeah like five out of the six five

49:44.720 --> 49:49.600
out of six are in concrete he followed the advice to a t he even went into concrete when everyone

49:49.600 --> 49:54.160
said it was saturated he's got five out of six deals he's at 9400 bucks a month and now he's

49:54.160 --> 50:00.240
transitioning into a new niche after this boom buy the book to the t and then he started you know

50:01.040 --> 50:05.040
wafting a little bit on the advice he didn't have super super good energy on the screencast

50:05.680 --> 50:10.480
lost a deal or two and he's back to the drawing board back to the thing jason already exact same

50:10.480 --> 50:15.040
thing he's following through t he's seen that when he deviates it falls off a little bit he's

50:15.040 --> 50:19.280
at 40 i just don't know what else to tell you guys other than we're going to a boring niche

50:20.320 --> 50:25.600
look at the due diligence exactly like we talk about it now we've given search volume and again

50:25.600 --> 50:29.600
i'm not going to say it on here because there's a little bit of context that needs to happen um

50:30.720 --> 50:37.120
but anyway go watch last week's live go into the city set up the ads like we teach you and if you

50:37.120 --> 50:43.280
have issues with the ads get on with jeff you know ask questions in here make connections be a

50:43.280 --> 50:47.680
student shout out to corey gilbert's doing a really good job of just like being in the asking

50:47.680 --> 50:51.840
questions and being involved in the community um guys there's 722 people in here that we can

50:51.840 --> 50:55.280
connect with that are doing the exact same thing as you i don't know why you guys if you're not

50:55.280 --> 50:59.280
not making connections making friends making colleagues you guys would could end up doing

50:59.280 --> 51:04.640
business with these people at some point um and then just go and do and that's it i don't i that's

51:04.640 --> 51:08.080
that's it the problem is that we get distracted the problem is we think there's a better solution

51:08.080 --> 51:12.880
the problem is that the next thing comes and we want to use this ai and that ai and it's like

51:12.880 --> 51:19.280
guys it's very simple boring niche simple city good enough search volume less than five dollar cpc

51:19.840 --> 51:25.120
boom boom boom run an ad use the script that we give you rinse and repeat rinse and repeat

51:25.120 --> 51:29.120
rinse and repeat and guys if you can make it one time let me give an example for our let me just

51:29.120 --> 51:34.000
say this like stephanie congrats to stephanie stephanie don't forget to get your swag stephanie

51:34.000 --> 51:39.440
just got our first deal 250 bucks a week thousand dollars a month boom she's been in here a bit she's

51:39.440 --> 51:43.840
been trying i want to give her a big shout out stephanie i would ask you this if you can do this

51:43.840 --> 51:49.280
one time if you can make a thousand bucks a month this is what one day i heard this and it really

51:49.280 --> 51:54.080
clicked for me if you can do that once that means you can do it 10 times and if you can do it once

51:54.080 --> 51:59.520
it means you can do it 100 times you now have an exact roadmap to get to a million dollars a year

51:59.520 --> 52:04.640
you can do that if even if it's a thousand dollar month deals you can get 83 clients and you could

52:04.640 --> 52:07.760
be at that now you're not going to need to do 83 clients because you're going to get 1500

52:07.760 --> 52:12.320
deals you're going to get the clients that the 7500 clients like we just landed in our agency

52:12.320 --> 52:18.960
because you get these bigger niches whatever you can literally get you have a roadmap to get

52:18.960 --> 52:24.320
to a million dollars guys how it's how it's it's mind-blowing because when i remember when i was

52:24.320 --> 52:29.440
just like i was going to college a little bit and i was writing down business ideas

52:29.440 --> 52:33.600
and i was like i want to be a millionaire but i didn't know a path to a million dollars

52:33.600 --> 52:38.160
if you can get one deal in here at a thousand dollars a month you have a clear path to a

52:38.160 --> 52:42.880
million dollars you just have to do it again and again and again and again and again and do it

52:42.880 --> 52:47.040
faster and do it better and sometimes do it bigger and make sure you retain your clients but you have

52:47.040 --> 52:51.840
a clear formula for how you can become a millionaire through digital real estate i think that's pretty

52:51.840 --> 52:58.560
exciting um porter and jason anything that you guys want to add last one more thing mike said

52:58.560 --> 53:01.840
i just posted the group would love to get your guys input on this live how many ad campaigns would

53:01.840 --> 53:09.440
you guys suggest launching your per month so i can get so i can land 2.5k in new mrr every month

53:09.440 --> 53:18.640
jason what do you think well if you want 2.5k month of recurring revenue then it only requires

53:18.640 --> 53:25.040
you to run two campaigns probably but um i would just say just be smart and just focus on closing

53:25.040 --> 53:29.440
the deal that's at hand and just win the day don't focus so much on just running five campaigns because

53:30.240 --> 53:36.480
i made this mistake you lose track of some of the campaigns that they're performing and you can't

53:36.480 --> 53:41.600
really put your focus on closing those specific deals and giving them the attention that they

53:41.600 --> 53:49.920
need so two deals would put you over 2500 in recurring revenue so two campaigns should do the

53:49.920 --> 53:56.640
trick that's it it's if you guys it's if you guys get dialed in if you guys get this process out

53:56.640 --> 54:04.000
then you have your flow mapped out you guys are on fire like it's crazy you can get to a point

54:04.000 --> 54:09.920
when you know with almost 100 certainty i am going to get this many deals in a month because

54:09.920 --> 54:14.320
it's just a formula and guys we're going to continue on our end to do our best to continue

54:14.320 --> 54:19.040
to give you the latest and greatest training the best the most up-to-date the best tools all that

54:19.040 --> 54:24.960
kind of stuff um but we're in the weeds with you we i'm talking to francesca almost i am talking

54:24.960 --> 54:30.080
to her every single day but we're zooming weekly strategizing how can how can we get another 10k

54:30.080 --> 54:34.880
how can we get another 10k how can we get another 10k um so we're in this with you guys and it's just

54:34.880 --> 54:41.280
a matter of just doing the doing the the the model that's literally it last thing i want to

54:41.280 --> 54:48.240
i want to say really quick is or just kind of remind you guys we are working right now on

54:48.240 --> 54:53.760
version 3.0 there's not going to be that much that's going to change um it's just going to be a

54:53.760 --> 54:57.600
refinement right it's like when you have a book that comes out you got to think and go rich it's

54:57.600 --> 55:03.600
like edition number 50 because they had a couple small changes um that's it we have some small

55:03.600 --> 55:08.000
adjustments that we want to make the market shifted slightly um it's not going to surprise

55:08.000 --> 55:12.800
nothing's going to surprise you but we are working on version 3.0 the content isn't going to change

55:12.800 --> 55:17.520
that much but the way that we deliver it the way that we're going to execute it that is going to

55:17.520 --> 55:21.120
change i'm really really excited about it so i just want to let you guys know that that is coming

55:21.120 --> 55:26.000
um and that you should be excited i do not have an exact date on that i'm trying to get it done as

55:26.000 --> 55:30.800
soon as possible um but we are going to be making some adjustments we're making some tweaks we're

55:30.800 --> 55:35.360
going to be able to give a little bit more of the accountability support and all this kind of thing

55:35.360 --> 55:40.400
so i want you guys to know that once again if you haven't already um check out last week's live if

55:40.400 --> 55:45.680
you want to know what the search volume is excuse me the minimum search volume is to have the full

55:45.680 --> 55:50.800
confidence going into a city and niche jason porter thank you guys for being on the call

55:50.800 --> 55:59.360
