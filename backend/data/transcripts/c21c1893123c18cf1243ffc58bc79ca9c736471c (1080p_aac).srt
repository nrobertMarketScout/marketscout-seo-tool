1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,360
I have people ask me all the time, Nick, those that are in your program that take longer

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,760
to get deals, those that are struggling a little bit, those that, you know, haven't

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,360
got their deal yet, what are they doing wrong, what's going on, why, why, why, why, why,

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,360
why?

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,360
Well, I'm gonna tell you why, okay?

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,400
And it's something I really want to point out.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,280
Some of you guys are coming to the table, some of you guys are just jumping to this

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,240
program, this is your first introduction to Rankin' Rent, okay?

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,240
Maybe you've done digital marketing, maybe this is your very first time doing a business,

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,520
maybe this is your first time doing an online business, whatever the case is, some of you

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,060
are brand new to this, others, some of you, or others, are coming and you guys have been

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,520
in Rankin' Rent for years, you've taken other programs, you've done other things, you've

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,040
been Udemy and whatever, Udemy and whatever, you've bought other courses, and you're coming

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,640
to the table with 5, 10, 15 websites, and guys, here's the cool part, you can use this

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,240
exact same process to sell other websites that are producing leads, okay?

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,720
But here's what I want you to be careful of, the number one thing that I see, the number

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,200
one hang up I see as far as people getting in the program, taking longer than they should

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,920
to get their first deal, is people, it's the following, okay?

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,200
People that come into this with existing websites, and in their head, they think the following,

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,200
okay, here's what I'm gonna do, Nick, I'm gonna come in, I've got 5 sites, I'm gonna

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,280
use this process, I'm gonna sell all 5, because I'm paying for hosting, I'm paying for phone

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,400
numbers, I'm paying for this and that and the rest, I'm gonna sell all 5 of those, get

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,280
clients, and then I'm gonna go do new projects, I'm gonna go pre-sell new websites, okay?

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,760
And I get it, in a perfect world, and with an engineered brain, everything fits into

25
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,760
a nice little box, and whatever, that's cool.

26
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,960
But guess what, here's what I would ask you, and this is what I want you to ask yourself

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,040
as you're going through this first module that you just went through.

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,960
If you had known what I just went through, the videos that we just went through, the

29
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,260
last few lessons that we just did, if you had known those things, and you're looking

30
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:11,960
at your site, maybe you got a site in, you got a roofing site in Ontario, Canada, okay?

31
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,520
If you had known what I just taught you, would you still have built this site, the one that

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,440
you're thinking of, the one that you're like, hey, I'm gonna go ahead and use this process

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,300
to sell it, would you still have built that site had you known what I just taught you?

34
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,460
If the answer is no, then I do not want you to use that as your first site.

35
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,720
I want you to either put it on the shelf and keep doing SEO, keep doing your regular thing

36
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,780
on it, or get rid of it, okay?

37
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,260
Because sometimes it's better just to cut it than try and squeeze blood out of a turnip

38
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,540
or whatever that saying is, okay?

39
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,660
And so what I've seen happen is people come in and they're like, hey, this site's getting

40
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:53,240
like two or three leads, and then you look at the market research, it's really competitive,

41
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,200
it's the wrong niche, the CPC is $10, $15, and they try and run it through this process,

42
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
they're like, oh my gosh, why is it not working?

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,160
Well, you're not following the criteria, you're not following the process that we just talked

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,800
about for the last couple hours, okay?

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,480
So here's what I want you to do.

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,380
If you have existing sites that are producing leads, what I want you to do is I want you

47
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:22,520
to run them through the exact same due diligence market research process that we just covered,

48
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
all of them.

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,760
Yes, I know, it's extra work, don't care.

50
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:34,240
Go and do that, and if those sites fit the criteria, they're low-hanging fruit, they're

51
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:42,040
layups, the CPC is under five but over zero, the volume matches, if those all check the

52
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,480
boxes, you got some freaking gold on your hands, baby, and you should use that website

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,460
first and you should go sell it, okay?

54
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:54,660
If they do not fit the criteria, then you either need to put it on the shelf and keep,

55
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,860
you know, do an SEO, doing your regular thing, or get rid of it, okay?

56
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,540
Sometimes the best thing is just to get rid of the dang site and go on to stuff that actually

57
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,540
works, okay?

58
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,980
Here's the game.

59
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,940
We need to get you to your first deal with this process, okay?

60
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,540
I don't care how much money you're already making, I want to get you, I need to get you

61
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:20,060
your first bit of money using this process, using the process, the results in advance

62
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,460
process that we teach in this program.

63
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,460
Why?

64
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,340
Because if you can get the first deal, there's this mental barrier that gets removed, you

65
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,940
go see it over and over and over, and there's tons of students in this program, some of

66
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,860
you guys that are watching this right now, you've seen it in your own business.

67
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,340
Takes you three years to get your first deal, you go in this program, you're in another

68
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,700
program for three years, you come in this, you get your first deal, and it takes three

69
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,220
weeks, and guess what?

70
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,700
Your second deal takes four days, or a week, or two weeks, but it happens right after,

71
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,700
and then guess what?

72
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,420
You get another one, and you get another one, and if you keep working, you keep getting

73
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,060
deals, so I know this game.

74
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,820
The game is I got to get you to getting your very first deal using this process.

75
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,340
I don't care if you've gotten previous deals, I don't care if you think you got deals because

76
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,740
you got paper lead and commission deals, or even if you got a flat fee deal, I want you

77
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,860
getting your first deal using this process, because what it's going to do is it's going

78
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,780
to give you trust, it's going to give you that confidence in this process, it's going

79
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:20,380
to remove that mental block that, oh, I can actually do this, and all of a sudden you

80
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,380
take off.

81
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,620
Guys, I just want to let you guys know before you go, I'm just going to go sell all these

82
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,980
sites because I don't want to pay for hosting, maybe what you need to do is get rid of those

83
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,980
sites.

84
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,340
I'm not telling you that's the case necessarily, but maybe you do.

85
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,380
Make sure that's the case before you just dive in.

86
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,180
For those of you that are brand new, don't even worry about it.

87
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,460
Follow the steps that we've talked about.

88
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,460
Pick the niche.

89
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,820
If you don't know what niche, pick concrete, do the homework, pick a great city.

90
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,820
Let's go make some money.

91
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,820
I'll see you guys in the next module.
