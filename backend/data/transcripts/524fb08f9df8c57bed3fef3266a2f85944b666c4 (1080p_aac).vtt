00:00.000 --> 00:15.480
As I said in the beginning, if you're going to run ads, you're just going to need to go

00:15.480 --> 00:20.360
ahead and expect and accept the fact that you are going to have an ad suspension.

00:20.360 --> 00:21.360
Okay?

00:21.360 --> 00:24.260
And if you're watching this video just to watch this video and you haven't had one yet,

00:24.260 --> 00:25.260
no problem.

00:25.260 --> 00:26.260
It's totally fine.

00:26.260 --> 00:30.140
I've had people that have seen people have ad suspensions and they ask, and it's a good

00:30.140 --> 00:31.140
question.

00:31.140 --> 00:32.140
They say, hey, what can I do?

00:32.140 --> 00:35.700
What are the top two or three things I can do to avoid ad suspensions?

00:35.700 --> 00:36.700
Okay?

00:36.700 --> 00:38.580
My advice is don't worry about it.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.580
Okay?

00:39.580 --> 00:40.580
Now don't do something stupid.

00:40.580 --> 00:44.540
And if you see somebody comment on something, like try your best to avoid it.

00:44.540 --> 00:48.500
But what I'm telling you right now is that it happens to everybody.

00:48.500 --> 00:49.500
It really does.

00:49.500 --> 00:55.540
For example, I have run a one point, at this point, time I'm recording this, $1.2 million

00:55.540 --> 00:56.540
in ads.

00:56.540 --> 00:57.540
Okay?

00:57.540 --> 01:00.300
It took me four years to get an ad suspension.

01:00.300 --> 01:01.300
Four.

01:01.300 --> 01:02.300
Okay?

01:02.300 --> 01:03.300
And I had actually spent over a million dollars.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.300
And I was like, you know what?

01:04.300 --> 01:05.300
I'm good.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.060
I'm not going to get the suspension, whatever.

01:07.060 --> 01:11.460
And I got four in one single day after spending a million dollars.

01:11.460 --> 01:16.800
So Google doesn't, it's not a respecter of persons as they say in the Bible, right?

01:16.800 --> 01:17.800
They don't care.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.800
They don't care how much money you spend.

01:18.800 --> 01:19.960
They don't care who you are.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.260
They're going to suspend you at some point.

01:21.260 --> 01:25.220
And here's my theory is Google, and you got to look at it from Google's perspective, right?

01:25.900 --> 01:26.900
Google's a massive company.

01:26.900 --> 01:28.340
We talked about this a little bit at the beginning.

01:28.340 --> 01:30.540
They're trying to protect their own butts, okay?

01:30.540 --> 01:32.380
You can't really blame them.

01:32.380 --> 01:34.860
So I just want to say, number one, it's going to happen.

01:34.860 --> 01:38.820
And so the first thing is, when this happens, I want you to, if you're watching this video

01:38.820 --> 01:43.700
because you just got a suspension, take a deep breath, okay?

01:43.700 --> 01:51.980
Breathe in, exhale, and realize you ain't special because everybody deals with them,

01:51.980 --> 01:52.980
okay?

01:52.980 --> 01:54.980
So just realize everyone dealt with them.

01:55.740 --> 01:58.780
Up until this point, and at the time of recording, I know we have a couple students that are

01:58.780 --> 02:04.260
currently under some suspensions, but I, to my knowledge, okay, again, to my knowledge,

02:04.260 --> 02:06.980
at the time of recording, with how many students, I don't even know how many students we have

02:06.980 --> 02:11.220
right now, but we have not had one student that's come into this program that has had

02:11.220 --> 02:15.460
a suspension that we have not been able to find a solution for, okay?

02:15.460 --> 02:18.820
And for the people that are in one right now that are going to watch this going on, oh,

02:18.820 --> 02:21.500
that's me, I'm going to be the one, I promise you're not going to be the one.

02:21.500 --> 02:24.780
You're not going to be the one because we haven't had that happen with anyone.

02:24.780 --> 02:28.820
You are going to go through it, it's going to happen, and the way I look at it is two

02:28.820 --> 02:29.820
ways.

02:29.820 --> 02:33.340
Number one is once you get through it, I've seen that Google doesn't hit you again with

02:33.340 --> 02:34.340
a suspension.

02:34.340 --> 02:38.100
Typically, it's like they give you the suspension, you get through it, and they're like, okay,

02:38.100 --> 02:39.660
that guy, that girl, she's good.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.320
That's a real business because they appealed that many times.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.260
No fake clown would do that.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.620
They're good, we're going to let them through.

02:45.620 --> 02:47.060
I haven't changed anything.

02:47.060 --> 02:51.340
Since I had my suspensions and I appealed them and I got out, I haven't changed one thing.

02:51.340 --> 02:54.140
I didn't learn my lesson, I didn't get slapped on the wrist and go, oh, I'm not going to

02:54.140 --> 02:57.520
do this or that because Google doesn't even know what you did wrong.

02:57.520 --> 03:01.320
You go ask their people, you get on a hold of their team, which is almost impossible,

03:01.320 --> 03:03.580
they can't even tell you.

03:03.580 --> 03:04.980
Take a deep breath, relax.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.120
Everyone's been through it.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.660
No one's not gotten through it.

03:07.660 --> 03:09.660
There's always a solution.

03:09.660 --> 03:10.660
I promise you that.

03:10.660 --> 03:13.660
Let's talk about these suspensions just really briefly.

03:13.660 --> 03:17.940
I want to talk about the two types of suspensions really, really quick.

03:17.940 --> 03:22.980
Number one suspension is, well, it's not in any order, but what you're going to see more

03:23.020 --> 03:28.780
often than not is the suspicious payment suspension, which happens to be a little bit more difficult

03:28.780 --> 03:34.540
to unsuspend from, at least compared to the second suspension type, which is something

03:34.540 --> 03:35.540
around circumvention.

03:35.540 --> 03:38.660
They'll say, hey, you circumvented systems or circumvented this.

03:38.660 --> 03:42.740
I don't even remember the verbiage, but they're going to tell you, you got some kind of circumvention.

03:42.740 --> 03:44.840
Those are the two things.

03:44.840 --> 03:48.340
Most people that are watching this, most people are going to have some kind of suspicious

03:48.340 --> 03:49.500
payment suspension.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.780
Guys, what you're going to do if you do have a suspension.

03:52.780 --> 03:57.020
The game is really, you just want to make sure there's nothing weird.

03:57.020 --> 04:01.900
Some of the things that when I say weird that I've seen is, let's say three years ago, and

04:01.900 --> 04:06.420
if any of these trigger thoughts, oh yeah, yeah, that's me, go and fix these things.

04:06.420 --> 04:11.700
I know we had a student that years and years ago, they had set up an ad really quickly

04:11.700 --> 04:13.780
and they're like, oh crap, I forgot about it.

04:13.780 --> 04:18.540
They went, they checked it out, and there was a balance of literally like $2, or maybe

04:18.540 --> 04:19.540
it was even like 20 cents.

04:19.660 --> 04:24.780
They went and they paid it, and then a couple days later, a couple appeals later, voila,

04:24.780 --> 04:25.780
they're going.

04:25.780 --> 04:26.860
That's one thing I've seen.

04:26.860 --> 04:33.100
Other thing is, I've seen people, they've used weird cards.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.860
They've had cards on multiple accounts.

04:35.860 --> 04:39.980
What I would tell you with suspicious payments is we need to diagnose the problem.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.780
If you have multiple accounts, go and check all of those.

04:42.780 --> 04:45.540
Make sure there's no balances that are outstanding.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.580
It might be something as dumb as 20 cents.

04:47.580 --> 04:48.580
Who knows?

04:48.580 --> 04:55.300
Then also, how many accounts, how many Google ad accounts is your card linked to?

04:55.300 --> 04:59.620
I know that it seems like, again, I don't know, but it seems like that seems to be a

04:59.620 --> 05:01.740
big factor.

05:01.740 --> 05:06.180
What I want to tell you not to do, what I don't want you to do, the first thing is do

05:06.180 --> 05:08.580
not go and create another ad account.

05:08.580 --> 05:10.580
Do not go and create another ad account.

05:10.580 --> 05:12.060
You think Google is that stupid.

05:12.060 --> 05:13.060
They understand how people operate.

05:13.060 --> 05:14.340
They know how people think.

05:14.340 --> 05:15.700
That is not going to do anything.

05:15.700 --> 05:18.700
Don't go and create another ad account.

05:18.700 --> 05:22.300
All that you're going to do is you're going to try and make sure there's nothing else

05:22.300 --> 05:27.060
that's weird out there, no extra accounts, no outstanding balances.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.460
Ask yourself, what kind of a card am I using?

05:28.460 --> 05:33.500
Am I using some weird one-off card, whatever, some prepaid visa, whatever it is.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.740
I don't even think they would allow that.

05:35.740 --> 05:37.420
Go and close all those things up.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.940
What you're going to do is you're just going to go and you're going to fill out an appeal.

05:41.940 --> 05:42.940
You're going to click on the button.

05:42.980 --> 05:46.740
It's going to say, if you think this is wrong, click here, and I'm not going to show you

05:46.740 --> 05:48.620
on the screen because it's going to change.

05:48.620 --> 05:53.740
Go find that button, click it, and it's going to have this application, this appeal application.

05:53.740 --> 06:00.020
Go and fill it out and fill it out as thoroughly as you possibly can.

06:00.020 --> 06:02.540
As thoroughly as you possibly can without spending that much time.

06:02.540 --> 06:06.500
You're going to go through it, you're going to hit submit or whatever the verbiage is

06:06.500 --> 06:10.520
and you're going to send it off, and what's going to happen is it's going to be off with

06:10.520 --> 06:15.440
Google for sometimes 24 hours, sometimes a couple days, sometimes I feel like it's

06:15.440 --> 06:16.720
a week.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.720
You're going to send it off and they're going to come back and most often the first time

06:19.720 --> 06:25.080
they're going to say, we apologize for the inconvenience but your appeal request has

06:25.080 --> 06:26.080
not been granted.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.160
You're like, oh my gosh, the world's ending.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.160
It's not.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.160
What are you going to do?

06:30.160 --> 06:31.960
You're going to go appeal again.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.360
This time you're going to ask yourself, did I fill it out thoroughly?

06:34.360 --> 06:36.960
If you didn't, damn it, fill it out thoroughly because you should have done that the first

06:36.960 --> 06:37.960
time.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.280
You're going to appeal and you're going to send it off.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.280
Is there anything that you missed?

06:40.560 --> 06:44.520
Any answers that you were half-assed that you could fill out better?

06:44.520 --> 06:45.520
Go and appeal again.

06:45.520 --> 06:49.880
You're just going to do this process and I know that you're going to be like, oh my gosh,

06:49.880 --> 06:50.880
this sounds terrible.

06:50.880 --> 06:51.880
It is.

06:51.880 --> 06:52.880
It sucks.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.280
You're going to do this process and I have seen, there's one student I can think of off

06:55.280 --> 07:01.160
the top of my head, they did this seven times before finally Google's like, okay, you win.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.160
Here you go.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.160
You're good.

07:03.160 --> 07:07.840
Until you've gone seven, eight, I would venture to say, until you've appealed 10 times and

07:07.880 --> 07:10.320
you're still running into the same thing.

07:10.320 --> 07:11.320
Keep appealing.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.560
Now, if you're not doing anything and you have accounts that are out there and you haven't

07:14.560 --> 07:19.000
checked to see if there's any weird stuff, then yeah, you might appeal forever, but as

07:19.000 --> 07:25.160
long as you shut all that down and go and check that and go do a very thorough, what

07:25.160 --> 07:26.160
would be the word?

07:26.160 --> 07:29.440
You want to go and just make sure, an audit, a thorough audit of accounts that you may

07:29.440 --> 07:30.440
have set up.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.440
Try and think.

07:31.440 --> 07:34.640
Was there a time when you watched a video in another group and they told you to go do

07:35.200 --> 07:38.440
and you wouldn't set up this ad account and think like, what emails?

07:38.440 --> 07:42.240
What I do is I go and search on my phone, I have all these emails linked up, I go and

07:42.240 --> 07:47.440
search Google ads or payment successful and I look, oh, and I look at the email, it said

07:47.440 --> 07:48.440
it too.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.520
Oh, it looks like I had my ad account set up under that email and the reality is in

07:51.520 --> 07:54.480
this business, we set up a lot of emails, we have a lot of burner emails, we have a

07:54.480 --> 07:57.840
lot of accounts and it kind of sucks and if you're not good at organization, you can get

07:57.840 --> 08:02.280
stuff kind of spread out, go and shut all that down and you're just going to appeal.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.520
You're going to fill it out properly.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.520
You're going to appeal.

08:04.520 --> 08:05.520
You're going to fill it out properly.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.520
You're going to appeal.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.520
You're going to fill it out properly.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.520
You're going to appeal.

08:08.520 --> 08:09.520
And you will get unsuspended.

08:09.520 --> 08:15.040
Now, obviously, as should be the case with any question, go and search the group, go

08:15.040 --> 08:16.040
and look at the threads.

08:16.040 --> 08:20.480
If those don't answer your questions, reach out to people, make your own post, tag the

08:20.480 --> 08:21.960
people that have gone through it.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.520
I know there's people that have gone through the freaking wringer and they figured out

08:25.520 --> 08:28.400
a way to get out of it, but what I would tell you is this.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.280
If you want to get out of the suspension, you will get out of it.

08:31.960 --> 08:36.240
If literally a Google ad suspension is enough to throw you off, maybe you should consider

08:36.240 --> 08:38.360
the fact that maybe you're not cut out for this.

08:38.360 --> 08:42.040
I love the fact that there's ad suspensions because I know it's going to eliminate half,

08:42.040 --> 08:46.240
if not 75% of the people that want to be successful and they're going to have an ad suspension.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.000
As soon as they get it, they're done.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.440
They're not going to try to do the ad suspension because it's too much work and they just don't

08:51.440 --> 08:54.840
want to deal with it and they're just going to stick with ranking and waiting six months,

08:54.840 --> 08:55.840
not me.

08:55.840 --> 08:56.840
I'm going to figure it out.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.160
I'm going to get to the bottom of it and I'm going to go.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.200
That's with the suspicious payment.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.480
With circumventing, it's the same exact process.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.680
Click the appeal, fill it out, send it.

09:06.680 --> 09:12.640
It seems to me in my experience and talking to students, if you have a circumventing issue,

09:12.640 --> 09:16.640
it seems to get appealed a lot quicker because it's more cut and dry whereas suspicious payments

09:16.640 --> 09:19.000
kind of out there, but guys, you're just going to appeal.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.080
You're going to fill it out.

09:20.080 --> 09:25.200
You're going to appeal after you've closed any doors that are weird, cards that are on

09:25.200 --> 09:27.640
multiple accounts, et cetera.

09:27.640 --> 09:35.760
Guys, once again, when you get a suspension, take a deep breath, exhale, realize you're

09:35.760 --> 09:37.320
not special.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.320
Everybody deals with them.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.320
I deal with them.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.320
You deal with them.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.320
Every single person deals with them.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.600
We're going to get through it.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.600
We're going to keep appealing.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.600
It doesn't matter if it's going to take 10 times, we're going to appeal and then once

09:46.600 --> 09:54.560
we get on the other side of the appeal, we're back in action.
