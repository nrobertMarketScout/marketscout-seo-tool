1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,240
All right, so here we are buying the tracking number for our website.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,400
We personally use car rail.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,160
You are more than welcome to use Twilio or whatever other software you want to use.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,160
That's fine.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,260
I'm just showing you what we currently use for our company.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:27,000
So once you make an account, very easy, you just put in your email and password.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,600
You can actually also log in through Google.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,720
So you're going to click on this, my account, and I believe it says E because it's evergreen.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,640
So whatever your company's name will have that letter up here.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,800
And then you're going to click on account settings down here under manage.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,880
Click under all companies and you're going to create a company.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:58,440
So each tracking number will have its own company and that's because let's say you

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,760
need to make a quick website for that same company.

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,720
We want everything to be very organized and under the same thing, it's very easy to search

15
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,280
as well.

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
And so we're going to create company right here.

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
You put the company name.

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,480
I actually made a mistake earlier.

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,520
It's called Queen Creek, not Queens Creek.

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,440
So let me just edit that up here as well.

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,440
Just really quick.

22
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
Okay.

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Back to CarRail.

24
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,840
So actually taking that out.

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,840
So it's just going to be like the website title, city and service time zone.

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,440
This will be the same time zone as the location that you're targeting on the website.

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,560
In my case, Arizona, you're going to put the primary company phone number.

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,400
What that means is where do you want the calls coming to your website directed to?

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,240
So it will be probably the client's phone number or the secretary, whoever is scheduling

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,000
the leads phone number.

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:26,640
I'm just going to put a random one, okay, add users.

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,840
This is where you can actually add different users to be able to check the reporting.

33
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,960
CarRail also allows you to listen to the recording calls.

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,040
And then once you add it, you can create an account user that is your client if he does

35
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,240
like to listen to the recordings.

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,000
So you can get pretty creative here.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And then you're just going to click on create company and go to company dashboard.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
CarRail will automatically take you here.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So let's select the company that we just created, which is Queen Creek Concrete here.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oops.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,160
It's the other one.

43
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,120
We already had one.

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,560
We do like to add the state as well.

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,880
I just didn't want to create a duplicate, so that's why I didn't put it.

46
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,880
But usually you want to put the state as well, just so you know.

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:24,300
And then you're going to create number, click, I'll use it offline.

48
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,300
Same thing as before.

49
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,480
It should automatically pull whatever number you put earlier.

50
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,000
This is the phone number that the calls will be redirected to, number setup.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,840
So you want to do a specific area code.

52
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:45,800
And how I picked this, I actually just Google Queen Creek, Arizona concrete, kind of like

53
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:52,480
if you were doing a due diligence and I like to see what the area codes of the main businesses

54
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
are.

55
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,640
It looks like it's a, this one is tricky because they're all different.

56
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:07,280
Looks like it's either 480, 480 looks like the most common one.

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:15,040
And then what I like to do is just stick that out and put area code because we want to look,

58
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:22,040
we want the website to look to the customers like we own the company and we're a local

59
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
one.

60
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
So 480.

61
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,160
So after that, you're just going to go back to Carl, type 480, which is the area code

62
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
we want.

63
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:37,140
Carl is going to show you four options and we like to check each option.

64
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:44,280
So you're going to copy, search for Google and search for all the numbers and pick the

65
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,880
one that looks the last, the least scammy.

66
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,800
And this is going to be a little tricky, but we like to make sure that we pick a number

67
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,120
that is going to be good for our website.

68
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
So search Google.

69
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Okay.

70
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,980
Now we have all four numbers and what I mean with scammy is once you search for all four,

71
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:17,600
so this one only comes up with few, once we search it, this one looks good.

72
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,920
We definitely, so this one for, this is a good example.

73
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,820
See how this one says escort Phoenix.

74
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,160
We definitely don't want people to think we're associated with that.

75
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,320
So that phone number we're going to scratch off.

76
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,480
Scam alert, definitely not that one.

77
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Some life mates.

78
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:43,440
Yeah, we probably want to go with this one.

79
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,320
Looks the least complicated.

80
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,720
So the one that ends in 2455 and then again, make sure you do this, especially for the

81
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,200
actual website that is going to be your asset.

82
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,520
And then we are going to name this Queen Creek, just like the company.

83
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Make sure you add the state.

84
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,600
I know I didn't do it for the company, but that's just because we didn't want to duplicate

85
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,240
and you're going to add the service number features.

86
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,280
Make sure you add a whisper message.

87
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,880
The whisper message is up to you.

88
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,440
What the whisper message is when let's say I find the website, I need a concrete driveway.

89
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,600
I call your client will pick up the lead and we'll receive a whisper message before the

90
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,560
lead talks.

91
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,200
So the client knows that that's a lead that came from you.

92
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,200
And so we can put something like new lead from Queen Creek concrete.

93
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,600
So the client knows, okay, this is a lead that Nick sent me or whatever.

94
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,360
And then make sure you click on call recording because we want to record every call that

95
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,440
came through and boom, you're done.

96
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,760
So it's right here.

97
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,520
This is your tracking number that we're going to use for the website.

98
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,900
And then this is the phone number you're going to forward the calls.

99
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,860
If you ever need to change it in the future, just click on this pencil right here.

100
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,020
You click on the pencil again up here and you're going to be able to change who the

101
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,340
numbers are being forwarded to.

102
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,540
You can change the whisper message, you can change everything and then just make sure

103
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,700
you click save and you're done.
