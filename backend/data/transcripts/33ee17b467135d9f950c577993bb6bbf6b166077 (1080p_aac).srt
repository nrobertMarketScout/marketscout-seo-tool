00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
I'm guessing you recommend Weebly for websites, right?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,720
Honestly, I don't think it matters.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,720
Some people have asked me this.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,240
I just, whatever you're comfortable with, whatever works,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,440
if you get a WordPress wizard

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,960
and you can save a couple bucks, great.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,120
If you're like me and you just like easy, use Weebly.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,480
I know in some of these other groups,

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,840
they have their own websites.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,000
My only advice is make sure that one person

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,040
doesn't control your entire life that doesn't own you.

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,680
But if you know which groups I'm talking about,

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,960
I have some sites with some of those builders

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,320
because I like to try them out.

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,160
So I'm gonna be using Weebly though.

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,840
I've made all my money on Weebly,

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,680
but you can make money on WordPress, doesn't matter.

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,080
But yeah, that's what I use.
