1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
Okay, guys, welcome to the call.

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,640
Today we're going to be talking about sub-nitching.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,880
We've been talking a lot about niches.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,900
We've been talking a lot about picking the right city.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,040
Basically the first step in the process, which I believe is the most important process apart

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,240
from the sales and getting the deal and getting people to give you their money, this is the

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,560
very most important part of the entire process.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,080
This is one of the, I think, what is the date?

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,880
It's August 12th.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,760
We're really focusing in this quarter on this first step, and so if it seems like we're

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:48,960
going very nuanced, it's because we are, and that is because I know when I say it, when

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,240
you first hear about this model, it's like, okay, pick a city, pick a niche, rank the

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
website, rank it out.

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,280
Boom, that's the 20,000-foot view, and that is actually true.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,840
However, you'll realize that all the money is in these tiny little adjustments.

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,040
It's in that 10%.

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,320
It's the difference between making a million dollars a year and making $10,000 a year is

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,120
in the nuance.

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
We are talking about nuance.

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,800
Today we're going to be talking about specifically sub-nitching so that you guys can, and so

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,920
I'm going to get into what we're going to cover and all that kind of stuff, but we're

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,200
going to be talking about sub-nitching inside of picking your perfect niche for whatever

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,400
project, whatever industry you decide to go into.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,920
Okay, so hold on.

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,640
Can everybody hear me, by the way?

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
You can hear me, right?

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Yeah, you're good.

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Okay.

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,160
I got another notification that said this meeting was being recorded, so I didn't know

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,840
if that was an error or what.

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,880
Okay, guys, what I'm going to do, give me one second.

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,120
I'm going to just open this window.

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
Hold on.

34
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
Get some light in here.

35
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:11,720
Okay, you can still hear me, Aaron?

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Absolutely.

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Beautiful.

38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,720
Okay, Aaron's going to be in charge of letting people in.

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,920
He's also going to be in charge of kicking people out.

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,480
He's going to be in charge of comments, questions, et cetera, and I'm going to leave time for

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,600
questions because I think that we've gotten in the last, this is our sixth week doing

42
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
this, right, Aaron?

43
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Yeah, that our seventh.

44
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Okay, this is our seventh.

45
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
It might be.

46
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
I got to count.

47
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:42,080
Okay, sixth or seventh, and we have had really, really good questions from these groups because

48
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,720
basically what these groups consist of is the people inside of the free group, the ones

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,920
that are actually serious about taking actions, the ones that actually want to go and make

50
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,240
some money and do something and don't just want to listen, they want to apply.

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,960
We have had really, really good questions that we're going to save some time for, okay?

52
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,240
Want to remind everybody that if you guys keep your cameras on and stay to the end,

53
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,920
we're going to take everything that we covered today and we're going to turn it into a digital

54
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,400
resource and we're going to just DM you guys from Donnie Dre.

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,520
He's going to DM you the digital resource.

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,200
I'm not going to have to comment anywhere, poke, whatever.

57
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,980
You're going to just automatically get it by staying on this call till the end and keeping

58
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,980
your camera on.

59
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,720
Okay, so that's number one, and what we're going to do is at the end, Aaron is going

60
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,120
to screenshot everybody that's on this call, okay?

61
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,720
Again, make sure your camera's on.

62
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,480
We're not trying to be weird, but we want to make sure that the people that are on are

63
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,720
actually on and we have that good energy, we have that good participation when it was

64
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
having a bunch of dead weight.

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,160
Okay, I'm a big fan of not having dead weight.

66
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:55,880
That's the whole reason that we're doing this on Zoom rather than doing it in Facebook,

67
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
okay?

68
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,520
So that said, guys, let's get into this really, really quick.

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,600
Aaron, does it look like we have anybody new?

70
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,320
In fact, what I want to do as we get started, I want to know really quick, is there anybody

71
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,560
in the comments, is anybody ... No, actually, it's what I want to do.

72
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,680
In the comments, I want to know how many calls you've been on since we changed the format.

73
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,720
Since we went to doing Zoom calls, these intimate Zoom calls, I want to know how many calls

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
have you actually been on?

75
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,320
Is this your first put one, if it's your third put three, if it's your fifth put five, if

76
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
it's whatever.

77
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,080
I want to know really quick, and then Aaron, I want you to start reading and let me know

78
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,320
so I kind of have an idea how many calls everyone's been on.

79
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Yeah.

80
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,000
This is the second one for Todd, first one for Trey, first one for Christopher, fourth

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
for Shane.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He's been with us for a while.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Jaleel, it's the second one, Jen's the third, Elden's the first, Jose's the first, Theo's

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,800
the third, and then Matthew's likely my eighth, so yeah, Matthew's been hanging with us.

85
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,720
So yeah, we got a couple people though for their first.

86
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,200
Is that Matthew Torres?

87
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Yeah.

88
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,240
Okay, girl, dope.

89
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,280
So I was going to actually ... My next question was, and going to let everybody know, any

90
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,760
of you, I think there's one or two I heard, maybe just one, maybe it's Matthew, but if

91
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,760
you are in digital landlords, you are going to get these recordings regardless.

92
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,960
I'm glad you're on these live because I think it's good.

93
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,760
You can ask questions, whatever, however, you're going to get these recordings inside

94
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,680
of the training material as well.

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
So just heads up.

96
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Okay.

97
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,560
The reason I wanted to ask is I wanted to know how familiar people are with me.

98
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:41,040
So really, really quick, I like to start every call with a one-minute synopsis of just my,

99
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,800
I guess my pedigree, my credibility here.

100
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,160
I don't think you should listen to anybody on the internet personally.

101
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,640
I think you should assume everybody's full of crap, but for what it's worth, my name's

102
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Nick Wood.

103
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
I've been doing this since 2016.

104
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,760
I had a little nine-month period where I chased shiny pennies.

105
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,640
I lost a bunch of money doing software or trying to do software, and it woke me up and

106
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,360
showed me just how good this business model was.

107
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,760
And sometimes you have to lose everything to realize what you have, which is true in

108
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,200
every single facet of life.

109
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,040
That's what happened to me.

110
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,840
And out of necessity, I either had to get a job to pay for my bills and take care of

111
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,920
my family, or I had to start doing this.

112
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,920
And I choose this every single day of the week.

113
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,120
Anyway, I lost a lot of money.

114
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,400
I've spent over about a million and a half dollars on Google ads alone.

115
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,440
I went $60,000 in debt.

116
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,360
I've had companies go bankrupt on me that owed me $15,000 plus.

117
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,760
I've hired and fired the wrong people.

118
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,360
I've gotten office space, and I shouldn't have gotten office space.

119
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,120
I made it through COVID.

120
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
I have almost quit twice.

121
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,640
I've gone into the wrong niches.

122
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,200
I've gone into the wrong sub-niches.

123
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,080
I've built over 200 websites, half of which were in the wrong niches.

124
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,800
I have done just about everything wrong that you can imagine.

125
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,120
And also, on the other hand, in 2020, I finally figured this out.

126
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,600
I figured out how to scale.

127
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,760
I figured out the missing pieces of this business model.

128
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,840
And we scaled this business to $100,000 per month, and we haven't looked back since.

129
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,240
Just over seven figures in 2020 did over $1.4 million in 2021.

130
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,000
And then we haven't looked back since then as well.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,280
And I tell you that so that as I'm talking to you, you're not sitting here going, who

132
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
is this guy?

133
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,360
Is this another person that's just talking?

134
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,520
You should assume that.

135
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,320
But I want you to also know that I don't speak, for example, today what we're talking about,

136
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
this is all going to be from experience.

137
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,080
And I'm going to go over kind of our game plan of what we're going to be talking about

138
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
here in just a moment.

139
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
And so you guys have an outline.

140
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,560
But this is only from experience.

141
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,160
And if I haven't done it, I'm going to tell you, and I do this because this is what I

142
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
wish that I had.

143
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:53,080
I wish that somebody who was basically five years ahead of me or millions of dollars ahead

144
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,640
of me could have been on a live and I could have asked them questions.

145
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,400
I could have asked them about this niche and that niche and what do you think about this

146
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,600
and what about running ads and what about scaling and who do you hire?

147
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,840
What about outsourcing and all these different things that I never knew.

148
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,880
And I would ask these questions, guys, to these groups that I was a part of.

149
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,800
But nobody in these groups had done what I wanted to do.

150
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,840
And I'm a huge proponent, a huge believer that if you have not done what I want to do,

151
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,720
I cannot listen to you.

152
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,520
I'll listen to you out of respect if I have to come in the room with you, but I'm not

153
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
going to take your advice.

154
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,640
OK, I'm not going to take advice from a trainer who doesn't have the body that I want.

155
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,920
I'm not going to take advice from a financial planner who doesn't have the the bank account

156
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,120
that I want and the investment portfolio that I want.

157
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,160
I'm not going to take marriage advice from somebody that doesn't have a thriving marriage,

158
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,560
somebody that I'm not going to do that.

159
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,120
And so I want you guys to know, as I'm talking on this call, I am somebody that's done this

160
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,440
and I've now trained over six hundred and seventy people to do this, one of which, Mr.

161
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,320
Ryan Dalton, who just barely got into this two years ago, I'm happy to say, is making

162
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,040
over seventy five thousand dollars per month.

163
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,240
I think is absolutely incredible.

164
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,160
He's also got two kids, a wife, a dog, hobbies and everything else.

165
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,880
So any excuse that you have for why you can't do this is an excuse.

166
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
OK, that's just the truth.

167
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,440
When I started this, it wasn't good time.

168
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,200
OK, it's never good timing.

169
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,880
I'm just going to let you guys know if you haven't started and you're waiting for the

170
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,120
perfect time, then hop off the call right now because it's not going to ever be good

171
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,240
timing. It's never good timing to do anything.

172
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,680
It's never good timing to get married, never good timing to have a kid, never good timing

173
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,680
to start a business or to take that opportunity or do anything.

174
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:37,000
And you're going to realize that you only get a couple of chances in life to like good,

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,360
good chances of opportunities.

176
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,400
And if you don't get in the habit of taking advantage of those, then you're you're you're

177
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,800
going to look back with regret.

178
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,920
And if you think that the timing is going to be perfect, you're crazy.

179
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,720
OK, when I started this business, I was knocking doors full time.

180
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,160
I had it. I was managing a team of 20 people with with a friend of mine.

181
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,520
So every single day I was knocking doors during the day, doing meetings until nine,

182
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,640
ten at night. And then I was working on my business during the day or sorry, during the

183
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,840
night. That was my that was my schedule.

184
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,120
So anybody that's sitting here saying I don't have time, whatever, whatever, whatever,

185
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,520
that's not true. OK, so guys, the goal today, my promise to you guys for you guys today

186
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,560
is that I'm going to give you guys enough knowledge on sub niching that you're going to

187
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,840
have the confidence to go into big, hairy, scary niches in a sub niche with a sub niche

188
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,320
angle. And you're going to do so without being worried.

189
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,160
You're going to do so without thinking that you're just going to lose your shorts and

190
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,880
you're going to do so very, very confidently.

191
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,080
That's my promise. The plan today, kind of the outline of what I want to cover over the

192
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,320
next 20 minutes before we get into Q&A is number one, I want to talk about what is sub

193
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,800
niching. OK, number two is I want to talk about why I think you should always err on

194
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,400
the side of sub niching, even with the non-competitive niches.

195
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,880
And I'm going to get into that throughout this.

196
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,880
OK, I also want to talk about how my screw ups led me to figure out sub niching and

197
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,720
they forced me to figure out sub niching.

198
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,840
I'm going to give you guys some examples on sub niching.

199
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,960
We're going to talk about how there's always a sub niche angle, easy ways to find sub

200
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,000
niches. And finally, I'm going to give you an example of one of my sub niche websites.

201
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,000
And then we're going to do some Q&A.

202
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,080
OK, so that said, I want you guys, if you have questions, I want you to start dropping

203
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,160
them right now because I am going to go rapid fire, get through as many as possible.

204
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,360
Last time we did a really good job and we got through a ton of questions.

205
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
I don't think there was any question that we didn't get through.

206
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,640
So, Aaron, while I'm turning down the AC, like I always do and I forget to do, will

207
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,480
you please see if there's any comments really quick?

208
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,360
Give me one second. All right is.

209
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,240
Think we should all invest in an auto air conditioner adjuster app or something for

210
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,200
that, because literally every single week.

211
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,680
But, you know. OK, was there any comments?

212
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,440
No, we're ready to just get to it.

213
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,240
Let's do it. OK, let's do this thing, guys.

214
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
So let's talk about sub niching really quick.

215
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,360
I'm not going to waste time on stuff.

216
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,960
It doesn't matter. Sub niching is taking a big niche and going into something that is

217
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,960
more narrow. OK, it's it's and we always hear the riches are in the niches.

218
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,920
And that is true.

219
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,400
And the thing that you don't realize when you get into this is everyone thinks of like

220
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:42,320
these big niches that are top of mind, HVAC, roofing, plumbing, solar, blah, blah,

221
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,160
blah, blah, blah. Right.

222
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,880
Everyone has I get if you know how many times someone's messaged me and said, hey,

223
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,440
what do you think about getting solar leads or what about this?

224
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,760
I would be very, very, very rich, very rich because everyone asks the same questions.

225
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,360
And the truth is, as I've said before, you can get you can get leads in any niche.

226
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,640
I've got them in assisted living.

227
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,240
I've got assisted living leads.

228
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,760
I've gotten golf lesson leads.

229
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
I've gotten cactus removal leads.

230
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,440
I've gotten the weirdest type of leads you could ever imagine.

231
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
You can get leads.

232
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,160
I've got them in alarm systems.

233
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,360
We've got them in tax tax returns, CPA stuff.

234
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,520
The the thing is, it's not black and white.

235
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,640
Which is the case with anything in life, right?

236
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,760
It's not are you going to get leads or not?

237
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,040
You will get leads. It's how many leads?

238
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,080
How how how is the juice worth the squeeze?

239
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,640
And so no matter what industry you go into, eventually you do enough of what we teach.

240
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,680
You're going to get leads.

241
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,480
The question becomes, is it the best use of time?

242
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,800
And so some of these big, scary niches, these roofing, these these

243
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,160
plumbing, these, you know, these bigger ones, everyone wants to mention,

244
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
even like electrician, whatever.

245
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,800
They're not the move.

246
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,760
They're not the move.

247
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,080
They're landscaping.

248
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,200
They're too, too, too, too, too competitive.

249
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,480
However, if you go sub niche, there's a lot of money.

250
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,360
And so what I want to say is, yes, there's money in there's riches in the niches.

251
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,560
But in my opinion, you know, I've said this, I said this last call.

252
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,040
There's there's riches in the the niche cities or the boring cities

253
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,960
or the cities that no one thinks about.

254
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,640
Right. And the boring niches.

255
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,480
But there's also a lot of money in the sub niches.

256
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,120
And so that's what we're going to be discussing today.

257
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,640
So some niche is basically just an offshoot of a niche.

258
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,240
So think, for example, we'll give you I'll give you an example.

259
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,680
Roofing and roof repair.

260
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,120
OK, roofing is the general niche.

261
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,080
There are companies that do roofing like they go and they do roof replacements.

262
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,680
That's where the big money's at for a lot of these companies.

263
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,600
I have a buddy that's making millions of dollars in Myrtle Beach.

264
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,480
A friend of mine, I know from Africa, actually,

265
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,960
and he grew up here as well, making millions of dollars doing roofing.

266
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,440
There's a lot of money in roof replacements.

267
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,040
Insurance pays for it.

268
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,640
It's you know, it's an expensive thing, but it's competitive, man.

269
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,600
It's very, very, very, very competitive.

270
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,920
There's also a lot of money for us in roof repair.

271
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,640
And for these companies, roof repair is not the thing necessarily that everyone wants.

272
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,360
It's not the thing that everyone desires.

273
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,040
But a lot of these companies, when things get a little bit slower,

274
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,320
they want to be able to keep their guys busy.

275
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,880
They want to be able to send their guys out, even if they don't make that much money.

276
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,920
They want to be able to send their guys out, fix a couple.

277
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,400
You know, let's say it's it's a climate like here, Vegas or Phoenix.

278
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,880
We have tile roofs.

279
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,120
Go fix a couple tile.

280
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,840
Boom, two, two, three hundred bucks.

281
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,520
They pay their guy.

282
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,880
They keep them busy while the jobs are coming in.

283
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,600
There are other companies, the smaller guys that will typically take on

284
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,240
just roof repairs, and they're almost more of like a roof handyman.

285
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,360
So anyway, that is what subnitching is.

286
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,120
OK, second thing I want to talk about, and by the way, Aaron,

287
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,160
if you have anything you want to add on any of these points, please let me know.

288
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,040
OK, sounds good.

289
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,280
OK, yeah, like actually real quick, dude, on that, like this was like a year ago

290
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,360
when I first got in the game, totally candid.

291
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,040
I did not end up I this was a I partnered with the dude

292
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,160
and we were doing like some crappy GMB.

293
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,360
He had didn't end up working out in terms of getting a deal.

294
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,680
Like I got a deal for like two weeks, totally collapsed

295
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,280
because the GMB got suspended.

296
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,360
Bottom line, the moral of the story for this context,

297
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,000
I was talking with this roofer dude.

298
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,200
This is like some 50 year old dude, a solo guy who's making bank

299
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,400
because he's charging like 900 bucks to like put a tarp over her roof repair.

300
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,400
So like I firsthand know like roof repair.

301
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,480
It's insane because he's like, honestly, put a lot of times

302
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,160
just put a tarp up and the customer is happy anyway.

303
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,280
Crazy good.

304
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,280
The thing I've learned about this, like talking about subnitches

305
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,840
and all these things is that man, anything that is.

306
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,600
The obvious stuff is never where you want to be

307
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,320
because the obvious stuff is what everyone's doing, right?

308
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,400
And so it always comes down to like, what's everyone doing

309
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,480
and how do I do something different?

310
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,760
Right. Everybody wants to get roofing leads. Right.

311
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,440
Cool. No one wants to go do roof repair leads

312
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,880
because it's not you don't get talked to the big companies and blah,

313
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,240
blah, blah, blah, blah.

314
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,680
But anything that nobody wants to do, there's money in. Right.

315
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,800
There are people right now.

316
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,640
That's what I've learned as I've started to travel the world.

317
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,360
I've met people from tons of different countries,

318
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,360
tons of different ethnicities, tons of different industries.

319
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,400
Guys, I know millionaires in the most weirdest industries

320
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,560
you'd ever imagine in your life.

321
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,960
I know a guy that's very wealthy.

322
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,680
I don't know exactly how wealthy, but this guy is he's a Lebanese guy,

323
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,440
but he's from he's from Sierra Leone, actually,

324
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,920
but he's he throws you off. He's Lebanese.

325
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,360
And this dude is making his money.

326
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,200
By taking garbage, taking plastic,

327
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,800
and and he figured out a way to turn it into cement blocks.

328
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,120
And he's basically it's like 30 percent cheaper. Right.

329
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,960
So instead of just producing seem like a lot of people in Sierra Leone,

330
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,320
they'll go and they'll start an import company. Right.

331
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,000
They'll go and import stuff from Lebanon and import stuff from Turkey.

332
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,360
They'll import stuff from China.

333
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,560
And then they'll they'll sell it to the builders.

334
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,680
They'll sell it to whatever. Right.

335
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,080
And that there's people that make a lot of money doing that.

336
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,760
And it's what this guy did is he's like, hey, instead of going

337
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,680
and doing what everybody else did, I'm actually going to go

338
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,320
and I'm going to I'm going to do building materials,

339
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,920
but I'm going to create a building material out of all the filth on the ground.

340
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,960
And he's he's become very, very successful doing that.

341
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,480
He also has a separate business that he started

342
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,960
where they take I don't know how else to say that they take shit,

343
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,080
human shit from the dump sites.

344
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,040
And they put it in these bags and they literally like

345
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,160
turn it into fertilizer and he sells the fertilizer. Right.

346
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,920
So instead of you could look at the overarching niche being,

347
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,680
you know, garbage collector or waste removal.

348
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,960
And he's gone sub niche and he's he's producing fertilizer. Right.

349
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,080
What I'm getting at is that there are always I think that the move,

350
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,080
no matter what you're doing,

351
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,640
you always want to look for the opportunity to sub niche.

352
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,160
And I don't care if even if you're not in lead generation,

353
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,360
let's say that you do this business, you go and you make ten thousand bucks,

354
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,240
you quit your job, you maybe you make twenty thousand bucks a month.

355
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,160
It allows you to travel and you decide at twenty thousand bucks.

356
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,720
You're going to kind of stop there

357
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,920
and you're going to go pursue some other businesses.

358
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,760
I think you're crazy, but you could.

359
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,720
And, you know, whatever business you get into, I don't care what industry

360
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,880
this is going to be applicable.

361
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,520
I truly, truly, truly believe that no matter what industry

362
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,600
this is going to be applicable for that.

363
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,960
OK, so let me give you an example really quick.

364
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,080
And one thing I want to say is that you do need to make sure

365
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,280
that the volume is adequate.

366
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,840
So you want to go and you want to be sub niche down,

367
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,160
but you have to make sure that the volume is adequate.

368
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,160
Does that make sense?

369
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,240
So, for example, if you're going to go into roof repair in

370
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,920
Las Vegas, Nevada, you need to make sure that even though that's a sub niche,

371
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,360
you need to make sure there's enough volume,

372
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,200
because as you start to go into sub niche,

373
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,680
you're going to start getting less volume than the main niche.

374
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,160
So as long as the volume is adequate, which that's another conversation

375
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,880
for another day of how to discover volume.

376
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,080
That's one of the things we talk about inside the program.

377
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,680
But as long as the volume is adequate, you can never go wrong by sub niching. OK.

378
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,440
I'm going to give you an example that's a little bit outside of this realm,

379
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,920
but it worked amazing.

380
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,520
So in 2021, I started my program, Digital Landlords,

381
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,440
and this is applicable because who knows, maybe one day you guys have your own

382
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,200
programs, maybe not, but this was this is very, very on point. OK.

383
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,200
So I got some coaching from somebody.

384
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,960
This is what I always do.

385
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,400
Whenever I want to do something new, I go find the expert and I pay them.

386
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,040
And in this case, I paid somebody, I think it was ten thousand bucks.

387
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,280
And they had this training that basically showed me how to A to Z, set up my,

388
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,600
you know, how to launch my program.

389
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,840
Imagine they're selling a program on how to sell a program.

390
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,720
What a genius thing to do. But I bought it. It was ten thousand bucks.

391
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,520
I bought it.

392
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,680
And one of the things that this person said is make sure to go niche,

393
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,520
make sure to go very, very, very niche and speak to your exact audience

394
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,320
that you think you're going to be solving the problem for.

395
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,400
And so that's what I did.

396
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,720
And so many of you will never remember this, but when I first started

397
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,720
my program, I called it flat fee mastery. OK.

398
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,880
And the reason I called it flat fee mastery is because at that time,

399
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,840
all the people that I knew, all the people that I knew

400
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,920
that were in this business from other groups, they were people

401
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,840
who had already been in other programs and they knew how to build a website.

402
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,520
They knew how to generate leads.

403
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,680
They just didn't know how to sell.

404
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,600
And specifically, they didn't know how to sell a flat fee deal.

405
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,240
They couldn't even fathom selling a flat fee.

406
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,080
I was getting messages all the time, dude, I can't get anyone

407
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,280
to do anything besides commission.

408
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,040
How are you selling flat fee deals?

409
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,040
So I'm like, dude, I'm going to be teaching people who are already

410
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,800
in other programs, and I'm just going to be teaching the sales side.

411
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,520
I'm not even going to be talking about the SEO.

412
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,840
I'm just going to be talking about sales.

413
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,520
And I'm going to be talking specifically about how to do flat fee.

414
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,760
And so guess what, guys?

415
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,360
I called my program flat fee mastery.

416
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,160
And guess what?

417
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,160
Our free group up until two weeks ago, I think.

418
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,960
When do we change the name of the free group, Aaron?

419
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,040
Just two weeks ago.

420
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,800
Yeah.

421
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,360
A week ago, two weeks ago.

422
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,960
It was called the art of pre-selling.

423
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,920
What does that even mean?

424
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,640
That doesn't even make sense to anyone.

425
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,400
Like, I was the worst name for a group to try to attract people

426
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,160
into this business that have never done it.

427
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,280
The art of pre-selling makes no sense.

428
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,720
It makes total sense, though, if you're already in the business

429
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,240
and you are like, you know, you've built websites,

430
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,600
you've waited six months and you're frustrated, right?

431
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,960
But because I thought I was talking to an audience

432
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,560
that had already been in the space, I didn't care.

433
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,800
Point being, guys, I targeted.

434
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,920
Let me tell you how narrow I went.

435
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,240
And, you know, the first like snitch is I went not just into general business,

436
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,480
but I went into marketing, right?

437
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,800
So there's all kinds of different business and then there's marketing.

438
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,200
But I didn't just go into marketing.

439
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,880
I went into, you know, lead generation specifically

440
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,960
inside the umbrella of marketing, lead generation.

441
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,920
And inside of lead generation, I went into local lead generation.

442
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,760
And inside of locally generation, I went into locally generation using organic.

443
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,880
And inside of that, like there were so many levels.

444
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,920
And inside of that, I went into

445
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,200
specifically flat fee

446
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
lead generation by building.

447
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,360
I mean, I was so niche that in my head, I was terrified

448
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,440
because I thought I was going to exclude all these people by going that niche.

449
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,320
And guess what, guys, I did the exact opposite thing.

450
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,800
And when you become when you go niche.

451
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,640
You become the expert, OK?

452
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,080
We've all heard, like, for example,

453
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,600
right now, I'm looking at investing in some property in another country.

454
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,080
And I am having the hardest time

455
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,200
finding somebody that's an attorney or a CPA, not an attorney, a CPA

456
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,920
that specializes or has knowledge and experience

457
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,360
on real estate in another country, specifically in West Africa.

458
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,520
OK, and more to come on that.

459
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,520
But if any of you guys have any ideas of somebody, don't waste my time, please.

460
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,280
But if you do, I'd be really grateful.

461
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,840
The only person that we found, we found one person and they charge

462
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,880
some insane amount of money.

463
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,760
I think it was over a thousand dollars per hour

464
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,120
to just consult, just to consult over some ridiculous.

465
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,440
It was enough that I couldn't even I couldn't even like

466
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,880
I couldn't even wrap my head around.

467
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
I'm like, what?

468
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,080
Like, I just need you to tell me if I can depreciate this and if it's the same

469
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,400
and how it's going to look and all this different stuff.

470
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,480
And and and that's that's what happens, guys.

471
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,960
When you become the expert in tiny sub niches,

472
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,120
that's where all the money is. OK, so I would love to see somebody

473
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,520
because I see people all the time on the roofing local.

474
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,720
I'm the lead generator leads for roofing.

475
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,480
I know I haven't seen roof repair lead generator.

476
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,360
OK, I haven't seen that.

477
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,840
I have not seen the roof repair lead generator.

478
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,920
And the reason why is because people are too scared to go sub niche.

479
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,920
But that's where all the freaking money is. OK.

480
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,760
So, Aaron, anything you want to add to that?

481
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,080
No, it's on point. OK, let's keep going.

482
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,320
Real quick, I'm not going to waste too much time on this.

483
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,920
But the reason I got into this, guys, is because I was an idiot.

484
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,000
That's what most most of the stuff I teach you guys,

485
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,720
most of the stuff I've learned is come by me being an idiot

486
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,520
and doing the wrong thing.

487
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,920
And basically what happened to cut a very long, multiple year,

488
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,440
multiple millions of dollars mistake

489
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,520
is I went into industries that were massive and got my butt kicked.

490
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,960
I went into roofing.

491
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,080
I went into I tried alarm systems.

492
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,560
I went into CPA.

493
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,240
I went into a space and waterproofing water.

494
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,040
Oh, my gosh, I got my butt handed to me

495
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,040
out of silver platter and waterproofing foundation repair right there with it.

496
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,000
Landscaping, all of the stuff.

497
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,600
I wouldn't even I wouldn't even waste my time doing a due diligence

498
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,480
on any of these niches.

499
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,600
Like I wouldn't waste five seconds on any of this stuff.

500
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,880
And I built tens.

501
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,160
Of in each of these niches, probably.

502
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,760
I'd say probably over 50 sites in those niches I just mentioned combined.

503
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,320
No more, because just in waterproofing the foundation repair alone, about 50,

504
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,320
I would say close to 100.

505
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,760
In the wrong niches, in these big niches.

506
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,520
So just so you guys know, you don't have to believe me.

507
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,760
You guys can go and see if the stove is hot yourself, because I understand

508
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,440
that's what you have to do sometimes.

509
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,800
But even if you can get that city and you can get that partnership

510
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,120
and you're like, no, I figured it out, guys, we're talking about scaling.

511
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,640
And guess what?

512
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,080
I've also had one or two good partnerships in these industries.

513
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,400
But the point is, it's not repeatable.

514
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,760
It's not something that I can duplicate.

515
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,560
And that's the issue.

516
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,480
OK, so that's that's really the reality is that you guys can either listen

517
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,440
to what I'm saying or you can go try it yourself.

518
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,040
And hopefully you guys are smart enough that you can look at my mistakes and go,

519
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,280
all right, let's just listen to Nick.

520
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,440
OK, that's why I wanted to start off by telling you my my experience

521
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,400
so you didn't have to go touch the stove yourself.

522
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,600
OK, a couple of examples of stub niches.

523
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,840
You know, we could talk about instead of roofing,

524
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,400
we could talk about roof repair instead of landscaping.

525
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:01,320
There's landscape design instead of electrician.

526
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,320
We could I don't even know what the term for this is,

527
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,560
but you could target just the electrical conversion for electrical vehicles.

528
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,560
I've done it twice in two of my no, I did it once.

529
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,040
Sorry, I got a quote on both houses

530
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,400
and realized my house was already equipped for it because I had an RV garage.

531
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,760
But I've literally called.

532
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,760
I've gone to Google and typed in like Tesla

533
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,360
electrician for Tesla charger electrician for electric car.

534
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,920
Do you know what that's called, Aaron, that conversion process?

535
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,040
I do not. OK, that's exactly right.

536
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,480
That's a niche. That's really sub niche.

537
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,040
And if you go into a big enough city

538
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,520
and you're just getting leads for electric, I mean, I'm sitting here

539
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,120
thinking I shouldn't have said that out loud.

540
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,240
That's a good niche.

541
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,560
Right. The electrical cars are only getting more popular.

542
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,760
I again, I've already had to call.

543
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,400
It's my second time I've had a Tesla and my brother's got one.

544
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,360
I mean, these things are getting in.

545
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,720
It's not just Tesla's now, right?

546
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,240
It's it's all electrical vehicles.

547
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,200
You have to have a special current flowing to the charger to have.

548
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,160
Otherwise, it takes like 24 hours.

549
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,960
It's ridiculous if you just do the regular charger, the 12 volt, whatever.

550
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,400
That's a sub niche inside of electric. I've never done it. OK.

551
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,240
Inside of plumbing, you have what's it called? Sewage.

552
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,520
What am I thinking of, Aaron?

553
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,040
Inside of inside of plumbing, septic, septic removal, I think it is.

554
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,520
Yes, septic tank septic is septic tank removal or septic tank.

555
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,880
Something like that. I know something septic.

556
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,120
I've never done it. I've never done it.

557
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,520
Instead of masonry, you can go into specific things

558
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,920
like block walls, which I'm going to show you today.

559
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,280
Guys, there any niche you're in right now, there's a sub niche.

560
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,760
Inside of inside of concrete, there's two different niches, right?

561
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,080
There's there's flat work, which is what everyone does.

562
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,120
There's decorative, which is what some people do.

563
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,160
And inside of decorative, guess what?

564
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,440
There's another sub niche called cool decking, cool decking.

565
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,640
They go, I did it in my house.

566
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,000
Your your your frickin cement is a million degrees.

567
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,960
Your kids are burning their feet. They come. They lay this nice coat.

568
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,480
They put some flakes on it, kind of looks like an epoxy.

569
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,880
It's called cool decking.

570
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,200
You could just do cool decking leads. And that's two layers deep.

571
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,840
You got concrete, then you got decorative concrete, then you got cool decking.

572
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,120
OK, any niche that you're in that I promise you there's a sub niche.

573
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,040
And that doesn't mean it's always good that, like, for example,

574
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,400
tree service, you could specifically target stump removal.

575
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,040
That's not the move, in my opinion, because stump removal,

576
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,400
there's not that much money in relative to tree service.

577
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,720
But if you were the best at it, and I bet you if you built a stump

578
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,480
removal website, you would outrank the best companies in any city

579
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,520
because nobody's targeting stump removal.

580
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,840
I'd have to run the numbers. I'd have to really figure it out.

581
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,920
And I'm not sure that every company wants stump stump removals.

582
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,400
But that's what I'm saying, guys.

583
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,880
I don't care what it is.

584
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,520
There is an opportunity inside of artificial grass.

585
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,080
There's people that are just searching for artificial grass

586
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,600
for specific things, right? Artificial grass, there's

587
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,400
there's artificial grass for your pets, right?

588
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,960
Pet friendly artificial grass.

589
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,480
Right, there's also a sub niche of of artificial grass.

590
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,200
You know, you could target people that are that are doing like

591
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,600
bigger projects. I wouldn't target big commercial projects,

592
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,840
but you could target different types of projects, right?

593
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,560
You just have to get creative.

594
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,280
Even like fencing, huh?

595
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,960
Like even like fencing, I know that that's kind of starting to get

596
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,680
a bit more popular, kind of an untapped niche, super relevant, obviously.

597
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,400
But like when you think about fencing,

598
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
there's like dozens of different types of fences.

599
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,880
So you could go wide, horizontal, right, or vertical and one specific niche

600
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:03,200
within that niche of chain link fence, wooden fence, barbed wire fence, you know?

601
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,240
Yeah, 100 percent.

602
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,320
Another thing I was thinking of is roofing, right?

603
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,280
So obviously, there's roof repair, but there's also metal roofing.

604
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,560
Right. There's specific roofing.

605
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,600
There's I'm sure there's I don't know what it is after the research,

606
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,760
but I know that Tesla or Sun's

607
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,880
Sun City, is that what it's called?

608
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,840
Is that what it's called? Sun City?

609
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,040
Is that Elon Musk's solar company?

610
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,560
I don't know.

611
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,440
Bro, that's going to bug me.

612
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,240
I think it's Sun City.

613
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,600
Yeah, it is. Hold on.

614
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
I just have to, you know.

615
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,840
Everyone wants to know as much as I do.

616
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,800
What is it? Why am I having?

617
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,280
Oh, someone said solar city, I think.

618
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,080
Solar City, Sun City.

619
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,960
Thank you, Discord user.

620
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,200
Discord user, thank you.

621
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,080
Point being, guys, there's always a sub niche, and that's the reality.

622
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,040
OK, so I just want you guys to know if, you know,

623
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,240
we've talked about going vertical like we did last week,

624
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,440
but I want you guys to really consider going sub niche.

625
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,160
Every single niche, there's a sub niche.

626
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,600
I don't care what it is.

627
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,520
I wouldn't do this one.

628
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,160
But for example, I know that there's a niche called cell phone repair.

629
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,680
I promise you that there's a way to go sub niche in that.

630
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,640
You could go with iPhone cell phone repair.

631
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,080
And to be honest, I bet you that there's way more people that do that anyway.

632
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,360
But every single niche, there is a sub niche.

633
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,480
And that, I believe, is where the money's at.

634
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,240
The reason why it's good and where there's a lot of money

635
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,480
in taking big niches and then going sub niche

636
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,160
is because typically the big niches are more competitive

637
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,200
and the sub niches are not.

638
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,080
And when you get into the less known niches and then you sub niche,

639
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,280
the only thing you need to be careful of is you need to make sure

640
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,320
there's adequate search volume.

641
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,600
OK, so real quick, guys, I'm going to share my screen.

642
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,720
I'll show you guys one thing really quick.

643
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,040
And then we're going to Q&A. OK, I'm going to try.

644
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,880
Am I got host, by the way, or cohost, at least.

645
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,640
Aaron.

646
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,440
Sorry, yeah, you should be good now.

647
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,760
OK, let me see. Where the heck did my window go?

648
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,200
Hang tight, brother.

649
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,920
Where's my?

650
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,560
OK, there we go.

651
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,040
All right, let me go ahead and do screen share.

652
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,320
Except for I don't know why it's not letting me got this update on.

653
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Hold on.

654
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,480
All right, there we go.

655
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,000
More. Dude, I don't know why it's not letting me screen share.

656
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,200
Can you I'm cohost for sure, right?

657
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,880
Yeah, and I have all participants enabled for sharing.

658
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,520
Weird, I wonder if it's because I'm inside of Safari,

659
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,840
which I believe is garbage.

660
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,200
It actually doesn't give me the option.

661
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,600
I know you're I know everyone's probably thinking, oh, it's the button.

662
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Every single button I click on, there's not an option to go.

663
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,520
It's weird. You want to send me the link and I'll quickly.

664
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,400
Yeah, you can look it up for me.

665
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,680
So, OK, cool.

666
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,760
What I want to show you guys, well, number one, just go to

667
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,640
go to roofing.

668
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
This is I want to show you guys really quick, a quick, easy way

669
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,560
to look at some issues, just kind of like roofing plus a big city.

670
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,800
Do you like roofing?

671
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,320
Chicago, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Chicago.

672
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,920
Doesn't matter to Chicago.

673
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,600
I'm a Chicago guy. All right.

674
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,040
Go to the top. Organic. All right.

675
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,720
Champion roofing. Beautiful.

676
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,240
I think I've heard of them, but through my research.

677
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,200
And then I want you to just look at the services.

678
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,160
All right. Services.

679
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,000
I hope pop ups for days.

680
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,440
So residential, we got. Oh, man, look at this.

681
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,720
There you go. So you could do roof, you know.

682
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,200
So these guys actually, this is a little bit different

683
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,440
because these guys are going sub niche.

684
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,280
These I technically could argue that these aren't necessarily roofing.

685
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,640
This is some examples, right?

686
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,000
You have roof replacement. That's the big daddy.

687
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,800
You have gutters, which is a sub niche off of roofing.

688
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,720
By the way, I've made a lot of money on gutter installation, gutter cleaning.

689
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,400
There's not a ton of money in.

690
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,560
They're adding masonry in here.

691
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,920
I don't think that's the greatest thing.

692
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,720
Siding is kind of like a whatever.

693
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,120
Let's go to another. Let's go to the next result.

694
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,080
I think these guys are kind of these guys are kind of shiny penny, in my opinion.

695
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,960
But here I ranking number one.

696
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,600
Oh, roof inspections, custom designers.

697
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,760
I didn't think of those that design roof design.

698
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,960
Never thought of that.

699
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,680
Root residential roof repair residents.

700
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,360
They're targeting just residential commercial roof.

701
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,040
I didn't know what that is. Infrared.

702
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,120
I don't know.

703
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
And then.

704
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,320
And every single one of these sub niches would shake roof system.

705
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Hilarious metal roof system, slate roof system, clay tile.

706
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,800
Unbelievable. OK, Aaron, I want you to go.

707
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,320
I want to give you guys an example of a quick before we get on this off.

708
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,120
So hold on one second.

709
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,520
You can just keep this window open like this, guys.

710
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,520
One of the very first deals I got when I got back into Legion,

711
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,320
because you guys know that maybe you don't.

712
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,240
But when I got back, I got in this business.

713
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,320
I got a couple of deals. I got shiny penny syndrome.

714
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,920
I, you know, whatever.

715
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,240
And out of necessity, I had to get back into this business.

716
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,920
And I came back and I started doing SEO because I needed quick cash.

717
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,280
And once I realized that SEO wasn't going to scale,

718
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,080
I think it may have been the very first website I ever sold doing regeneration

719
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,840
when I finally realized, oh, my gosh, this is where the money's at.

720
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Was a sub niche of masonry.

721
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,440
So I want you to go and I want you to type in St.

722
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,760
George Block Wall just in the in the let's see how the suckers ranking.

723
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,920
I haven't logged into this in a long time, dude.

724
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,320
All right. St.

725
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,800
George Block Wall.

726
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,960
OK. Oh, still ranking number one.

727
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,840
Hello. Top one.

728
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,720
Let's see me.

729
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,320
I know that I can tell.

730
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,240
Look at this thing. This is a beauty.

731
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,240
OK, so St. George Block Wall.

732
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,400
I built this thing. You can even go to who is go look at who is, bro.

733
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,000
I think it's going to show you. I bought this in 2019.

734
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,760
I think I should have been.

735
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,320
Go look at it really quick. Look me up.

736
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,000
And while you do that, I'm going to get my stripe account

737
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,800
and tell you how much money I've made from this one.

738
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,880
I don't even.

739
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,760
Is it who is domain?

740
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,520
Yeah. Do you have SEO quick on your toolbar?

741
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,560
I don't. OK, don't worry about it.

742
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,480
But anyway, I was going to just prove to you guys that I.

743
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,400
Oh, and I'm not even logged in on Stripe on this computer.

744
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,520
So my laptop, never mind.

745
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,160
I know for a fact, I've made over twenty thousand dollars.

746
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,840
Go back to the website.

747
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,440
Is it right there?

748
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,360
I'd have to figure it out.

749
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,760
I don't know. It's not that relevant.

750
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,880
So go back to the website.

751
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,280
This website right here, dinky freaking website ever has.

752
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,240
I know for a fact, if not, it's probably closer to 30,

753
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,360
but I can with 100 percent confidence say I know it's made me over.

754
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,520
It's made me for sure over twenty thousand dollars. OK.

755
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,160
And you know what the best part about this is, Aaron,

756
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,480
is that the person that I was selling these leads to for twelve hundred dollars

757
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,240
a month for over a year and a half,

758
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,160
they're still paying me for a different set of leads.

759
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,880
But this person ended up joining their part of digital landlords.

760
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,440
The business owner of this of this is a digital landlord.

761
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,560
They decided they're like, dude, I love doing what I do.

762
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,720
They make like I think they make like seven million dollars a year.

763
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,000
Their company does. They don't even do block wall.

764
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,120
They do stucco and they wanted to start learning how to do this

765
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,240
because they wanted to not have to be stuck to their city.

766
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,240
So it's it's it's hilarious how this works.

767
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,360
Anyway, this thing's made me over twenty thousand dollars.

768
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:07,440
And we're talking about not just masonry, we're talking about block wall.

769
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,760
There's I would say the majority of cities in America.

770
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,040
You wouldn't even know what I was talking about because it's it's

771
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,200
the ugliest fence in the world, but for its climates like Vegas,

772
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,280
St. George, Utah, Phoenix, Arizona, they make us put these ratchet

773
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,560
looking block walls like we're in a prison.

774
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,280
And it's just the way that people do it.

775
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,960
And so I went sub niche.

776
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,840
This thing was making me over twelve hundred dollars.

777
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,320
I think we ended up doing it.

778
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,920
It's like eight hundred dollars a month now, but this thing's ranking so well.

779
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,720
I don't think we even have to run much ads, if any at all.

780
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,920
These sites, these pictures are garbage.

781
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,400
Some of these pictures actually go down a little bit like those ones right there.

782
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,320
I actually that top right one, Francesc and the bottom right one.

783
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,240
Francesca actually took that photo.

784
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,240
She actually drove to a job site, took that photo.

785
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,680
So that's insane.

786
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,560
So, you know, guys, what's cool about that is within that within block wall.

787
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,400
I mean, obviously, as Nick was talking about, if you go to niche,

788
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,520
then there's not enough volume, it's too targeted, it's too specialized.

789
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,680
But now even within here, there's even sub niches within block wall.

790
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,720
Now it's low competitive enough where you can get all those sub niches

791
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,880
within the sub niche of block wall.

792
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
It just goes to show it's an endless combination.

793
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,760
Cinder block retaining wall in Vegas.

794
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,640
Dude, I'm making I mean, dude, you can go.

795
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,000
And again, sub niche in big cities works.

796
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,680
OK, we got five minutes.

797
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,720
You can un-share this just to give you guys an example.

798
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,600
And let's go through a couple of questions really quick.

799
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,880
And we had a couple of people.

800
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,040
So this was this was from Christopher.

801
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,680
This was in earlier what you were talking about.

802
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,920
He said, thought I'd saw you made some big money in basement waterproofing.

803
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,640
I think that was a YouTube video you did like last year that talked about.

804
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,680
You got a deal that got lucky, right.

805
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,440
And then, OK, that's right.

806
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,080
You can go into it if you want.

807
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,480
It's competitive, bro.

808
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,800
Very, very. You can make money, just not.

809
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,680
You can make more money elsewhere.

810
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,560
I don't think it's worth the squeeze. That's just my opinion.

811
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,280
I'm going to I'm going to do rapid fire on these Q&A.

812
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,440
Keep going. Cool.

813
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,040
Jen said, would you please repeat the niches?

814
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,600
You said you got your butt kicked in real quick.

815
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,760
I'll we'll be putting this in that cheat sheet real quick.

816
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,800
But I mean, you talk about like roofing, basement waterproofing.

817
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,400
There's like two others there.

818
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,160
Solar.

819
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,040
Alarm systems, CPA.

820
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:20,600
Yeah, I mean, dude, just anything that plumbing HVAC,

821
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,200
anything that's just very obvious is competitive.

822
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,960
OK, for sure.

823
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,000
And then, yeah, Jason mentioned flat roofing, roofing tile repair,

824
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,960
just as some niches within roofing, which is 100 percent right on.

825
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,760
And then Jensen, what do you charge for St.

826
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,960
George Blackwall? You says a thousand or twelve hundred.

827
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,560
It was twelve hundred when I started.

828
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,480
I think our current time, I wanted to log into my start.

829
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,200
Oh, actually, I might be able to hold on.

830
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,800
Keep going. And I'm going to look this up.

831
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,480
I'll come back. I'm going to see if I can find it real quick.

832
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,400
OK, yeah. She says.

833
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,880
Or what did you charge in the beginning?

834
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,360
I don't know if this is still an active deal you have, but let's see.

835
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,840
No, I still do. I think it's 800 now, by the way.

836
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,480
I just opened up Stripe and I love it's not much.

837
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,400
But I just as well, I was sleeping even better.

838
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,360
I made one hundred and fifty bucks sleeping last night.

839
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,720
That's kind of cool.

840
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,160
That's for epoxy, by the way.

841
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,440
So keep going.

842
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,360
I just had to just every time I see it, it just makes me happy.

843
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,760
For sure. Jaleel says quick question for later.

844
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,000
How one would you introduce yourself to a prospect when cold calling?

845
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,320
If they don't ask, what's your connection to the lead?

846
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,520
So, Jaleel, if you are you talking about like when you call the lead,

847
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,480
we just called your your phone number or the business owner who you're prospecting.

848
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,960
Because we can give you a quick little answer.

849
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,760
That's a next.

850
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,000
Make some YouTube videos on that.

851
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,680
But it's a good question.

852
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,160
We can quickly address that.

853
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,400
Shane Noble says, do the business owner.

854
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,800
So, yeah, what you do is and Nick actually has a couple of videos on this,

855
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,920
but you pretty much you almost act like the customer start

856
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,200
because you got to get your foot in the door.

857
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,760
You can't just say, hey, are you interested in concrete leads?

858
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,800
You got to say, hey, do you guys do concrete in XYZ city?

859
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,720
Right. Kind of make it sound like you live there. Right.

860
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,000
And then they're going to be you keep going on like, OK, do you do cover the zip code?

861
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,640
You can even get specific. Right.

862
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,640
And then they'll probably ask like, OK, so is this for you or like, yeah,

863
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,400
we can give you a free estimate next week or whatever the case may be.

864
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,200
And that's when you transition to like, oh, it's not for me.

865
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,800
I just got this guy, Bob, who's looking to have a new driveway installed

866
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,520
and just want to make sure it's something you do before wasted any of your time.

867
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,200
Right. And then they don't know what to think.

868
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,400
Or is this a referral friend or whatever?

869
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,400
Now you kind of got some open time before they just click hang up on you.

870
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,640
And that's when you transition to, hey, man, so I got these leads coming in.

871
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,600
I'm looking for someone to send them to.

872
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,360
I wasn't happy to give you a couple for free.

873
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,960
And then all I ask is just later have a conversation

874
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,240
to see about an ongoing partnership.

875
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,920
Like, in short, that's the cold call. Right.

876
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,160
So good. Obviously, there's variables.

877
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,200
But by the way, real quick, I just looked it up.

878
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,840
I just text Francesca about St. George.

879
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,600
But I know we have a couple of different websites

880
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,360
specifically targeting block wall.

881
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,040
And one of them were making three hundred dollars a week.

882
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,960
One of them were making two hundred and twelve dollars a week

883
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,040
just to kind of put it in context.

884
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,120
So there's money in it.

885
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,160
There's definitely money.

886
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,080
Let's go through a couple more. For sure.

887
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,360
So, yeah, Shane says, do you do service pages when you do sub niches?

888
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,160
Yeah. Look at my St. George block wall.

889
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,200
Yeah. It was like cinder blocks, retaining walls, brick masonry, stone mason.

890
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,960
Like all these are block wall related.

891
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,360
I always do a couple of service pages.

892
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,280
I usually do three to five service pages no matter what. Right.

893
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,840
Just helps with ranking.

894
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,240
Plus you get more leads for a bigger piece of the pie.

895
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,440
So. All right. And then Jose says, I already have a roofing site and GMB.

896
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,760
If I change that to roof repair only, well, I mess everything up.

897
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,640
Yeah. With GMB, especially.

898
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,520
Yeah. And it's not so it keep the domain the same,

899
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,800
but you're going to have to go change your title.

900
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
You're going to get your page title, your meta description,

901
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,520
all your bolded stuff, your categories, your service pages.

902
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,600
You're better off just starting fresh.

903
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,360
But if the question is, do you already have leads coming in

904
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,600
or are you just trying to write games?

905
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,720
If you have leads coming in and you figured out a rank by all means,

906
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,200
we're trying to avoid having a bunch of extra work.

907
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,000
But if you've been like me and you're dumb enough that you kept doing it

908
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,560
and you ranked great, there's money in it.

909
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,560
It's just it's not worth the squeeze. Right.

910
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,680
For sure. This is like one more question from Jen.

911
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,760
She says, how many leads do you get for the block wall sites?

912
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,440
Interested in how that relates to pricing?

913
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,040
Real quick, I can obviously you'll toss in your two cents.

914
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,360
But we typically like to when this actually what you teach, Nick.

915
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,160
But like when you look at the lead value calculator,

916
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,760
you go to like MyLeadCalculator.com, whatever we want to price stuff

917
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,160
so that at the low the worst case scenario or like on a minimum,

918
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,040
we want to at least double or at least triple their profit.

919
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,120
Right. Like on the low end, be conservative.

920
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,840
And so all you got to do that, it's really not a pay per lead basis.

921
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,400
Obviously, I mean, you can do the calculation. Right.

922
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,600
But with stuff like this, generally speaking,

923
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,040
that concrete artificial grass, bigotry service jobs,

924
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,960
if Nick correct me if I'm wrong, generally 10 to 15 leads

925
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,080
is like kind of what you got to aim for to charge at least

926
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,400
a thousand fifteen hundred a month.

927
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,000
Yeah, as long as the niche, as long as they're making,

928
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,240
you know, roughly, I would say with block wall, maybe slightly more.

929
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,560
But yeah, it all just depends on the size of the niche, the profit margins.

930
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,440
And yeah, the rule of thumb is we want to at least double

931
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,640
on a conservative with a conservative number.

932
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,400
But yeah, I never give guarantees.

933
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,520
And typically my websites, I kind of like even though I don't say it out loud,

934
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,040
I kind of lead them to believe like we're not going to get any more

935
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,480
than 10 to 15 leads tops.

936
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,120
And then I go in and I smash it for him.

937
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,360
I know that site gets like

938
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,760
30 leads a month. It has been for a while.

939
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,040
And I know that because it's been I've had that I've had.

940
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,680
I've had to change clients because my client joined my program

941
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,480
and stopped by my leads, which is ironic.

942
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,960
But I replaced them.

943
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,160
And we've had that site go lives in 2019.

944
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,240
Awesome, dude. One more question.

945
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,200
Yeah. So Shane has to hop off.

946
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,320
Great to have you on, Shane.

947
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,880
Trey says, what do you tell the lead when you don't have the business

948
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,520
to say you work with for?

949
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,680
That's a great question, Trey.

950
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,200
Usually just Nick always says this, like, take control,

951
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,160
tell them what they want to hear.

952
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,600
So when you answer, just you move the process along.

953
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,000
You're the one who is controlling things like, hey, Bob, so I missed a call.

954
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,880
We missed a call. You're looking for a concrete estimate.

955
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,920
Like, yeah. So like, OK, what I'm going to do is I'm going to quickly get your info.

956
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,000
The business owner, he's on the field right now.

957
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,880
But later today, when he's available,

958
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,440
we're going to call you back and that way we can schedule an estimate.

959
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,200
Right. And that's when you'll do the three way.

960
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,720
Just use the term business owner.

961
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,200
You don't need to box yourself in. OK.

962
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,160
Aaron, real quick, before we get to the last question,

963
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,200
I want you to share the digital landlords application link.

964
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,800
And I'm going to tell you why we're going to be doing.

965
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,160
I had this crazy idea and I'm going to be

966
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,280
I haven't decided if I'm going to be taking one or two people.

967
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,880
But basically, long story short is we're going to be doing something

968
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,640
that's kind of outside the box by with inside of digital landlords.

969
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,280
It's going to be by application and qualification only.

970
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,560
So if you apply for digital landlords,

971
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,280
we'll probably run you through what I'm talking about here.

972
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,520
That doesn't necessarily mean we'll choose you.

973
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,800
But it's going to be very we're going to be doing something

974
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,520
really interesting with one or two people.

975
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,320
Basically, long story short, I'm not going to tell you all the details,

976
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,040
but we're we're almost going to handhold you to getting your first deal.

977
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,600
And it's it's going to be unique.

978
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,360
You are going to have to do something in exchange.

979
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,240
But for those of you that are like a little bit nervous or whatever, this

980
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,040
like I'm basically going to make sure that you guys get a deal.

981
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,640
So for those of you that are on the fence, I just want to

982
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,160
I haven't talked about it much on this call at all.

983
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,560
But Aaron just dropped a link.

984
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,760
If you guys value your time and you're like, hey, these calls are great.

985
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,760
I'm tired. Like some of you guys that are sitting here

986
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,360
just waiting for free information.

987
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,440
Now you've waited six weeks.

988
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,200
You should have had to do if you were in the program,

989
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,600
you could have had a deal by now. Right.

990
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,800
But you're you're getting dribbled content and we're still talking about niches.

991
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,160
Right. Because I can't cover everything in these calls.

992
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,760
So anyway, here's the heads up.

993
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,720
If that's something you've been on the fence about, I would apply right now

994
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,520
because I have something really interesting.

995
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,040
And it's we're going to be doing that either this week or next week.

996
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,120
So mention this, what I just mentioned.

997
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:01,760
And I will anyway, it's it's it's it's very interesting.

998
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,720
Any if everyone is called would find it interesting.

999
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,680
So just a heads up. OK, one more question.

1000
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,880
Yeah, let's see.

1001
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,480
Trey says this is the last question.

1002
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,640
Have you heard of anyone having luck in saltwater aquarium niche?

1003
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,720
No, but why not?

1004
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,800
You could do like fish tank installation, maybe like for artsy, fartsy, rich.

1005
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,920
For sure, bro. Like when I was in pool installation, guys,

1006
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:31,000
I had a website in Vegas, fiberglass drop in pools.

1007
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,320
So it's not landscaping, it's pools, it's not just pools, it's

1008
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,840
it's it's prefab pools, it's not just prefab pools,

1009
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,960
it's fiberglass prefab pools in Vegas.

1010
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,680
And the guys pay me two thousand bucks a month.

1011
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,840
Say less, Nick, say less.

1012
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,680
Guys, thanks for being on the call.

1013
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,840
Did you get a screenshot of everyone's on this call right now?

1014
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,240
Doing it right now. Thanks for the reminder.

1015
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,280
If you're on this call, you get the camera on,

1016
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,080
you're going to get a nice little nicely packaged digital resource

1017
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,440
that Aaron's going to put together today from my notes.

1018
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,800
And you're going to get that DM to you.

1019
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,880
And with that said, guys, again, if you're somebody, it's like, hey,

1020
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,000
I'm tired of like once you guys it clicks for you guys,

1021
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,240
that time is not coming back.

1022
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,640
You're not getting it back.

1023
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,680
Then you'll start to realize that who gives a rat's turd about money?

1024
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,160
You can always make the money back, dude.

1025
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,240
That money I spent to launch my program, dude, you know, it's funny about that.

1026
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,280
Well, people don't realize

1027
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,480
that guy that I that trained me on how to launch a program.

1028
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,840
I bought that in 2021. Ten thousand bucks.

1029
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,360
Never met the guy. I was in Dubai for a month.

1030
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,320
Dude moved to Dubai and I hit him up.

1031
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,680
I was like, hey, bro, I want you to know my first year,

1032
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,200
I made a million bucks following your training, which is true, by the way.

1033
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,600
And dude, he had me on his podcast, which is going to release here

1034
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,240
in the next couple of weeks.

1035
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,280
You don't you don't realize sometimes the club like this is a thing

1036
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,120
people don't talk about. You want to get close to somebody, go buy their stuff.

1037
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,240
I wasn't doing it for that intention, but this guy had me on his show.

1038
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,520
I've got his personal cell phone number.

1039
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,680
The guy takes over 10 million dollars a year.

1040
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,680
It's just, dude, so that's pay to play.

1041
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Just I'm just saying it's just a side thing.

1042
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,280
So anyway, that's it, guys.

1043
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,120
Thanks for being on the call.

1044
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,920
We'll see you guys next week.

1045
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,760
Thanks, Aaron. Take care, guys.
