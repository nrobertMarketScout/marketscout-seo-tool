00:00.000 --> 00:09.880
What is SEO and why do we do it?

00:09.880 --> 00:13.760
So I'm gonna go very basic here and some of you that are experts and have been doing this

00:13.760 --> 00:18.200
for a long time, just bear with me, I'm all about the fundamentals because fundamentals

00:18.200 --> 00:20.600
wins basketball games, ask John Wooden.

00:20.600 --> 00:27.480
Okay, so SEO, I know this is very basic but S stands for search, E stands for engine,

00:27.480 --> 00:30.880
O stands for optimization, search engine optimization.

00:30.880 --> 00:36.280
In layman terms, it is taking a website and getting it to the top of Google.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.280
Okay, that's it.

00:37.280 --> 00:43.080
Very, very simple and there are certain things that we have seen and tested and proven, at

00:43.080 --> 00:46.520
least in theory, that they will get you to the top of Google and I say that at least

00:46.520 --> 00:49.880
in theory because nobody really knows the answers.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.640
This is Google that's messing with us.

00:51.640 --> 00:57.440
Google basically gives these little breadcrumbs and says, hey, this is what we say helps but

00:57.440 --> 01:01.380
we don't actually know if that's true and it's just a big giant game for them but here

01:01.380 --> 01:07.520
we are, we're playing the game because this traffic that will come from SEO is worth gold.

01:07.520 --> 01:16.200
So this is the part where we are going to turn a deal into an asset and I'll tell you

01:16.200 --> 01:18.640
right now if you're watching this video and you're like, hey, I don't really care about

01:18.640 --> 01:23.320
the assets, I just want to have my deal at 1000 bucks or my deal at 1500, I'm gonna spend

01:23.320 --> 01:28.720
the $300 or $400 or $600 on ads, I'm gonna make the difference, cool, shut this part

01:28.720 --> 01:31.200
down and keep doing deals.

01:31.200 --> 01:35.680
However, I would highly recommend you continue these modules, you continue watching, you

01:35.680 --> 01:40.800
continue learning, you continue growing because if we can nail this part, this is where we

01:40.800 --> 01:45.920
can get the website to rank at the top of Google and when a website ranks at the top

01:45.920 --> 01:49.680
of Google, we start getting what's called organic traffic.

01:49.680 --> 01:55.800
That is traffic where people will search for Concrete Queen Creek using our example and

01:55.800 --> 02:00.680
they will look and find our website without us having to pay for ads, they will call us

02:00.680 --> 02:05.840
without us having to pay for ads and therefore that traffic is essentially free, those are

02:05.840 --> 02:11.320
free leads for us so it costs us $0 to acquire and then we can turn around and be charging

02:11.320 --> 02:13.240
that same 1000, 2000.

02:13.240 --> 02:15.680
So the game is very simple.

02:15.680 --> 02:21.440
We're going to use SEO, we're gonna build up the website, we're gonna use SEO and we're

02:21.440 --> 02:27.600
gonna rank it at the top of Google and as the organic calls start to come in, it's gonna

02:27.600 --> 02:33.840
allow us to shut down the ads little by little and our organic continues to increase and

02:33.840 --> 02:39.200
there's gonna be this shift so every time we decrease our ads by $10, we make an extra

02:39.200 --> 02:41.200
$10 because our price stays the same.

02:41.720 --> 02:45.600
We make $100 so we're doing this, okay?

02:45.600 --> 02:49.640
I highly, highly, highly recommend doing this part of the process.

02:49.640 --> 02:56.000
This is the final piece because this is where we go from a deal to an asset.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.480
One of the other benefits of doing SEO, of getting your website ranked is it solidifies

03:01.480 --> 03:04.500
the deal and it mitigates our risk.

03:04.500 --> 03:11.380
What I mean by that is if we only have leads coming in from ads, we run the risk of Google

03:11.380 --> 03:15.100
messing with the ads and us being affected.

03:15.100 --> 03:21.580
But if we have leads coming in from SEO and the ads, if Google messes with the ads, well

03:21.580 --> 03:23.380
we still have the SEO leads, right?

03:23.380 --> 03:24.500
We still have the organic leads.

03:24.500 --> 03:32.020
So doing this is going to solidify the deal and mitigate our risk.

03:32.040 --> 03:37.940
What I've seen in my experience is the leads that come in from SEO, the organic leads,

03:37.940 --> 03:40.940
meaning leads that weren't paid for by ads.

03:40.940 --> 03:44.980
I don't know if this is actual fact, this is just my gut telling me, but it seems like

03:44.980 --> 03:47.140
they're usually a little higher quality.

03:47.140 --> 03:51.620
I don't know if it's because the buyer, the person that's searching for that service is

03:51.620 --> 03:56.140
a little bit more savvy and they see the ads and they go, hey, you know, that's an ad which

03:56.140 --> 03:59.580
means that that company paid to be there, I'm gonna go and look for the organic.

03:59.580 --> 04:01.120
I don't know.

04:01.220 --> 04:06.080
But pound for pound I have seen that the leads that come from organic seem to be a little

04:06.080 --> 04:10.160
higher quality and by higher quality I mean they convert a little bit better.

04:10.160 --> 04:14.360
Again, this is just a gut thing, but I really, really like the organic leads.

04:14.360 --> 04:20.960
Even though we don't necessarily need them, they're super, super nice to have because

04:20.960 --> 04:26.000
again they mitigate our risk and they just allow us to sleep better at night.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.520
So guys, with that said, let's keep going.
