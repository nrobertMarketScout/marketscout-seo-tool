{"text": " all right so I just logged in into our own designer Weebly account just because we want the website to be in our own we're going to create a website for Queens Creek Arizona concrete now concrete is pretty general make sure you're talking obviously to your client like some concrete companies they do driveway patios they do crack repairs they do concrete paving they do stamp concrete so make sure and this it goes back to your keyword list that you are targeting only the services that the company does because certain companies do certain things and not everything so once you're logged in you're probably not going to have any of these because these are all of our old websites so you're going to click up here top right create website and okay so here you're going to pick your theme this is kind of up to you I'm going to pick one of the ones that we usually use and keep in mind that once you create one frame you can actually duplicate your website so let's say you have a second concrete company you can actually just duplicate your first one so you don't have to do this whole thing from the very start but I am going to show you on how to get it started for the first time so let's go with this one right here okay and we be likes to kind of create a website for you but we're going to delete every page that they made for you except for the home one so you're going to click start editing right here and it should bring you down here reload editor okay so you're going to delete that one can stay there for a second you're going to click on pages up here and I just want to get rid of everything that we've created for me because we're not going to need it so click on delete confirm let's delete every page that they made for you because we want to create our own and in the home one just click on SEO settings make sure there's nothing here okay go back now we're going to delete everything so every element that was put in here we want to delete because we're trying to make our own you might just be able to click here perfect and delete the whole section that way you don't have to delete every single piece manually so just click delete it should just eliminate the whole thing okay and then do it again and delete perfect so pretty fast pretty easy now click on build up here let's add a title up here in the header section and then we are going to add okay so add so we're going to click down here on installed apps click on the plus sign where it says add app and we're going to add some elements are not into designer Weebly already so in the search bar just type h1 and we're going to add this one right here h1 tag okay should be free so you don't have to pay for it click on it then click on add connect and done perfect and now it should show up here okay so we can add that right here at the bottom okay perfect now we are going to add another title under our title right here okay so in this top title in the header we're going to put the company's name obviously we're not going to put the actual company's name we're just putting the service that we're targeting and the location so in our case it's going to be and I like to put everything in capital letters Queens Creek oops concrete okay I don't like going into separate sentences I like to be in the same line so I'm going to make it smaller and then we can go back and edit the fonts because they look a little cartoonish and then we're going to add a phone number right now we don't have a phone number so you can just put like xxx just so you know that's where you're going to put the phone number okay all right now we're going to put some text at the bottom of the h1 I like to put a little spacer there this is up to you on how you want to structure it you can put a spacer you can put a divider the divider is just a line so it's right here and then under there right here so what we like to do is have the h1 right here a text here we like to put a corner image right here so drag the image until you see this little shape see how the shape is gone and now the shape is back it looks like a square when you see that square you just drop it the mouse and once you we put an image right here now right now it looks a little funky but once you put the image right here you are going to have the text right next to it and now we're going to put the quote form the instant quote form right to your right of your text so right here it's called a contact form on Weebly so we're just going to hold in grab it and drop it right here perfect this is how we want it to look like and now we're going to create the quote form and we usually put free a hundred percent something again we're not making this website to make them look amazing and fancy we just want them to convert so we wanted them to be simple clear to the point of what people are getting and how to reach the contractor in the easiest and fastest way as possible so free a hundred percent instant quote because we want them to think that they're going to get the quote right away okay I actually like to put this making myself so I'm going to delete that and we don't need a comment section so let's just leave the email put a large text box above the email this is no let's do a short short text box okay perfect and you're going to click on it right here in the fill title you're going to put name okay and then we are going to put checkboxes will we arrange the order just put that and then we're going to put a drop-down box and then do not forget this we need the phone number because if we don't then our client cannot call the lead back so make sure the name phone number and the email right there one important thing this should be automatically done by Weebly but make sure there is a little asterisk it's red and tiny at the top quarter that means that the person that is filling out the quote is required to fill out that information in order to submit the quote if you don't do that then people can't skip on the number and how you check it is actually right here once you click on the field it's required is checked out see if I unmark it the asterisk goes away so make sure that's on because we don't want anyone skipping on any information because if someone fills this out and we don't have any more phone number it's a lost lead so and how we like to order this is actually to put what the client needs at the top and then gathers information at the bottom because people are more likely to fill it out if they can fill out their needs first and then tell you who they are instead of the other way around okay so we're going to change this field to what service do you need and again you can customize this to whatever your niche is to whatever you think would be best option items right here you can add as many as you want so I like to put the services that the client offers so in this case it could be concrete driveway oops driveway concrete patio these are just some samples we can put stamped concrete okay and if you click add option you can add as many as you like if you click on edit you can actually delete them and you can also move them so you can have stamp concrete at the second and stuff like that and then you click on done click out of it and you're done with that this one I like to put when do you need do you need it question mark option items I'm going to put I am flexible this week and then as soon as possible okay so we are done making the form and there is something else that we like to add but make sure you check in with the client and make sure that that's something that they could possibly offer so first of all we like to center this since it's the title so center it right there then you're going to add a spacer so it's not so cramped and then we usually like to add a text right under the free instant quote where we say something like plus free bonus coupon just to kind of get them more interested again checking with the client and see if they could even offer a slight coupon or something like that if they don't then just remove that and we're going to center that let's make that bold as well see it and then lastly the button right here see how it's skirted to the left we want to make a center as well so just click on the main thing you're going to click on button you're going to align it to the center and we're actually going to change what it says I like I would like to say get quote exclamation point then click out of it then oops I don't know why I did that it's not a problem just move them back how they wear okay perfect and then one last thing when if you click on form options you can actually name this and what we like to name it just to keep it organized it would be the same as the title of the website in our case it's Queen Creek put the state concrete and then since this is the form for the home page I like to put in parentheses I like to put an H you can also put home whatever you are more comfortable with something like that and then right here is where you're going to put the email you want this form sent to you so I'm just gonna put my email I wait every time I get this form so I get forwarded to mine okay then click save and we're done with the form creation okay now I would like to put more sections because especially on the home page we're going to add a lot of content so go right here under structure you're going to select section and you're going to drag it right below right here I like to put a couple of section because this is the very first one let's put a second one okay and then we're going to add some titles in here and text then you can put a divider once we have the content and we're adding the content we can also switch things out but just to have it there already prepared for us we'll do this and then let's use this for images so let's put some images perfect let's add another section underneath text put a divider spacer another title up here and we'll go more in depth in the next videos about content and how to structure that so don't worry about it right now right now we're just framing out our asset and here at the bottom okay so this is the home page now what we usually do for our websites and this depends on your competitors so when you do the due diligence you're going to have the top three websites are ranking and you're going to see what their website looks look like if your competitor has ten service pages we definitely want to beat them but on average what we like to do is create one home page three service pages and a contact page so what you do after this one is the frame is built out you click on pages and you're actually going to click on the plus sign right here we are going to make a non clickable menu this is where you'll have drop down with the services and you're going to put the page name as services out of it done okay now click I would actually like to just duplicate the home page because we already have that quote form it just saves you time so click on home and click on copy and it's just going to duplicate it so we're going to change the name of it you're going to in my sample for my client I would like to call this stamped concrete that's one of the main services and again you want to pick the three service pages to represent the main most searched three services in that niche in that location that your client covers okay make sure there's nothing in the SEO settings always make sure and you're very attentive to details this is very important when you do things like that okay so the title and the number will always remain consistent and the same in every page down here the h1 we haven't even put in so we don't need to worry about the only thing is remember when we created the quote form in the form name just make sure you switch that I just I would just put service one oops service one save it and then everything else can stay the same we should actually add the phone number at the bottom as well so let's make a separate section right here at the bottom so we don't forget and drag a title in and we're going to put another the same phone number we're just going to put it down align it in the center and let's do that on the homepage as well so right at the bottom after you're done writing all of your content you're going to have a section that is just having the phone number xxxx align the center let's create the other two pages and once you're done so this looks perfect the only thing is we want to make it underneath the service how you do that see you just see when you screwed it over it gives that gap right here and boom it's right here so let's just copy this one as well and make sure that it's underneath there as well we're going to call this concrete driveway make sure the quote form says s2 so you know this is service page number two and then we're going to copy it again make our last service page and again you can go in and add it and make as many as you like this is just the average of what we usually do I'm going to call this patio and just make sure the quote form says three and then we're going to add a contact page the contact page is very simple it's actually going to be so it's not going to be under so we want home services and home again that is going to be contact contact us and then you can actually delete every section because the only thing the contact page is going to have is a big form to fill out for them and then on the contact page we also add the link to the Google My Business so we definitely want this phone number down there but you can go ahead and delete the content and just have the main quote form right here I don't know why did that see that's why you want to pay attention to you tell sometimes often designer we believe it we believe in general we have little glitches so you want to make sure that everything looks how we first set it up on every page name number and email going to save it see it's already looking different for some reason so just make sure it all looks the same save again attention to details is very important when you're building out this framework so just make sure that everything looks consistent because if it if it doesn't you know if you have stuff like this coming up to someone it's going to look not very professional so just touch it up make sure you're checking every page even if we did duplicate them just double and triple check on things being very consistent on each page same with the header and you again you shouldn't have to do this all the time sometimes it does this see that pretty sure there you go okay service to last service page and we are almost done building the frame of our asset right here make sure you always click save as well and then perfect this looks good the only thing that sometimes we like to do but this is totally optional click on build and sometimes just to make the quote pop especially if you're using a white background under the header so just like this one is called we like to use a color block so just drag this right above the quote okay like that and then you're going to drag the whole quote form in it like that now it's not going to look like it's anything but you can actually change that's how you make the quote in a different color and this sucks in Weebly but you it's you don't only have this option you can actually put your own colors here and how you do that is I think if you click here and change color it will give you a color palette okay I know it's at the bottom but let's say we wanted to make it a nice and bright yellow a little more orange like that you can copy this code I don't know why it's not copying it click out of it change color okay I'm just going to write it down so it's F1 AB 40 okay you click again on the color block and you change color and you can insert your own color so you don't have to pick out of these ones one eight be forty click out of it and it will make it that color okay perfect and it moved the surfaces again okay perfect and you're going to this to do this for every page again now you're probably looking at the quote from this is one when you make colors and adjustments and stuff like that you're going to see well you can't really see here right and if you click up here in this desktop you can actually see how the website would look on phone so keep that in mind as well like this looks gigantic it looks silly on a phone so and the spacer we probably want to remove because it's a really big gap so click back here and once you we are done adding the content we're going to do the little touch-ups but just really quick click on theme this is where you can change the color and the fonts and we please nice so he actually highlights what things are you see it's going to highlight that the paragraph title can remain the same the paragraph text we want to make it black because it's pretty hard to see there you go and then you can change the font let's try things out okay feel like that's all more visible and then we are going to delete the spacer again it's totally up to you just kind of how you see things going and then this we like to do it a different color and the one above this a little bigger oops make sure you save save save let's make this a little more yellow and then again this is up to your preference just can even make it blue okay 40 CDF one see if that looks better again don't overthink this but you can definitely make smaller adjustments okay and we are done building the frame",
