00:00.000 --> 00:10.360
All right, now that we have created the website, we're just missing the images.

00:10.360 --> 00:17.600
So rule of thumb, we get 25 images total for our website that has three service pages and

00:17.600 --> 00:19.820
that does not include the header photo.

00:19.820 --> 00:25.800
So it's 25 plus 126 and the 26 photo is the header image.

00:25.800 --> 00:31.720
So right here where it looks blue is going to be your header photo.

00:31.720 --> 00:37.040
There is usually the best way you can get images is just by asking the business owner

00:37.040 --> 00:39.280
that you landed.

00:39.280 --> 00:42.680
The reason why is because you're going to be the best pictures you can get the most

00:42.680 --> 00:46.220
local, the most like authentic photos for this.

00:46.220 --> 00:51.280
It's going to make the website look really local, very authentic instead of getting stock

00:51.280 --> 00:52.280
images.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.080
So that's what we recommend you doing.

00:54.080 --> 00:58.160
You do need to remember two rules when you're doing that.

00:58.160 --> 01:04.200
Number one is when you're asking the business owner for photos, make sure that they are

01:04.200 --> 01:06.320
not being used on his own website.

01:06.320 --> 01:10.800
A lot of the times when you're pitching and you're selling leads, what happens is the

01:10.800 --> 01:16.760
business owner already has a social media account, a Facebook page or their own website.

01:16.760 --> 01:24.520
So we do not, and again, we do not want to use photos that are already being used by

01:24.520 --> 01:29.840
him or her on their website or social media because that would be copyright.

01:29.840 --> 01:36.520
So any photos that he sends you, they need to be fresh or unused on his own platforms.

01:36.520 --> 01:38.360
That being said, that is the first rule.

01:38.360 --> 01:44.800
Number two, let's say he has some fresh images or he's going to take pictures for you.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.800
And one thing that I personally do is I just say, Hey, if you don't have photos, next

01:48.800 --> 01:53.640
time you do go on the job, just take some on your phone and usually an iPhone camera

01:53.640 --> 01:54.640
will be pretty good.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.200
Take them on your phone and email them to me.

01:58.200 --> 02:02.360
And then the number two rule is make sure that the pictures that are being taken do

02:02.360 --> 02:05.600
not have the company's logo on it.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.600
And just be attention.

02:06.600 --> 02:13.160
Like a lot of the time, the concrete contractors will wear a t-shirt that has their company

02:13.160 --> 02:16.280
logo on it or they'll drive a truck that has the company logo on it.

02:16.280 --> 02:21.320
So make sure that the pictures that you're taking from the business owner do not have

02:21.320 --> 02:28.320
their company name on it because we are targeting this website as Queen Creek concrete.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.360
And if in the future you ever need to switch up the business owner, you don't have to

02:31.360 --> 02:34.760
worry about, Oh, well, it's marketing that company.

02:34.760 --> 02:38.200
So those are the two basic rules for images.

02:38.200 --> 02:43.400
And then one last thing, let's say you cannot get images from the business owner.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.400
You can.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.760
And we do use stock images.

02:46.760 --> 02:50.160
We like to use the free trials.

02:50.160 --> 02:57.280
So for example, just go on Google and type free stock images and we'll have a video on

02:57.280 --> 03:00.360
how to optimize images and get, grab those images.

03:00.360 --> 03:04.080
But right now I'm just showing you very quickly.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.280
We use like stock Adobe, Shutterstock.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.800
They all have free trials that you can use.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.240
So just go ahead and take advantage of those and you're done.
