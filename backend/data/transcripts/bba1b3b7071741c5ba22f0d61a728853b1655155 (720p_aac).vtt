WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Thank you.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
All right, guys.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
I think we are hopefully live.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Let me know if you guys can hear me.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
I'm going to do the everyone tag.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Boom.

00:41.000 --> 00:51.000
There's that.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
All right.

00:54.000 --> 01:16.000
Let me bring.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
All right.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Hey, guys.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
All right.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Awesome.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Okay.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Let me know if you guys can hear me.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Um,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
And.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
There we go.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
There it is.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
All right.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Waiting for, um,

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
Give me a few seconds here.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I want to get you guys set up.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Um,

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
This is going to be our new search.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Um, campaign.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
That we've been talking about doing.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
This is going to be a website traffic one.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Not a call one.

02:06.000 --> 02:15.000
Um,

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
Okay.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
Okay.

02:30.000 --> 02:38.000
There's Francesca.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Hey, Francesca.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Are you coming on?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Let me know if you can hear me.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Hello.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Hello.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Okay.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Okay.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Okay.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Yeah.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yes.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
I know.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Aren't they all.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Okay.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Um,

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
All right.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
I think I got us on here.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Let me check.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Um,

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
The group, make sure there's nobody with any questions.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Um,

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Josh is asking and can't tune in for this stream. Yes.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
This is going to be penned hopefully to the top or one of the other

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
websites.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Um,

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
And then, um,

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
We'll be building on this again.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
I kept told everybody.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
We're going to be, uh, making.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Uh, like better, more polished versions for this,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
that we can dive deeper into things on.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
That'll eventually get added to the backside of the website.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
But for right now, we're just putting this up here so you guys can get

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
going.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
And you don't have to wait on us and things getting edited and

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Um,

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
I think that's kind of where we're at.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Um,

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Just give me one quick second here.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
I find that the, um,

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Well, I think the last time I told you,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
it's like super delayed between Facebook and us.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
It's weird.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Yeah.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
So questions come in later.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Yeah.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
So I, I'm going to pull this up on my phone.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
And this silence it, but it's just, uh,

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
It's weird.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Right.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
That was like 10 seconds ago.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
I know it's weird.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
It's super weird.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Okay.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I'm just going to leave this off to the side.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
So if I see.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Uh, chats come in, they can pick them up.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
All right.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Um, okay. So today we're going to set up.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Uh, another search campaign.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Uh, earlier today I went on and I made the changes to the call

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
only ad that we did for the new Orleans duck work.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Um, so I set those up.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
And we're going to be, um,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Doing the same thing to this one in like a week or two, right?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Cause those are, as you know, with your experience,

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
like that's just a common thing.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
And it's one of the negative drawbacks of the search campaigns for

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
sure.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Um, okay. So with that, we're going to do.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Screen share.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
I'm so slow at this stuff today. All right.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I feel like I've been like on the phone or zooms all day today.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
And I feel like I've done nothing.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
So, um,

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
I'm sure you've done a lot.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
My checking account does not agree.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Um,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Anyways, it's been maintenance day.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
I feel like today's been maintenance day, but that's, that's just happens.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
All right. Um,

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Okay. So before we dive into this one,

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Let's see, Jason has a question and I have a new question.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
I just joined the group about two weeks ago for unpaid balance.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
The appeal date times.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
You know,

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, Jason, that's totally normal. Oh no. Unpaid balance. Oh,

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Uh,

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
My experience with the unpaid balance thing is, um,

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
If you search the group,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
you'll see a bunch of chats about it like from like a year or two ago.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
But typically what's like,

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
there's something that's tied to your Gmail or a credit card or something

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
like deep inside the world that Google could be store music,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
YouTube or something.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
So if you, if you're looking for unpaid balance,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
like you're looking for something that's like,

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I'm looking for something, um,

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
getting you a gift card,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
something that's like got a weird balance on it.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
And that's what's holding you up.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
So just check that go back through your history.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
And, um, eventually you'll be able to find it. Okay.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Hopefully that helps, but.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
It does happen. You just gotta go find it.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I've had stuff for like 72 cents.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
But I don't know.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
So.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
All right.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.040
So we'll, we'll hop in. If you have anything, you know, the rules, just yell, scream, stop me.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.680
If I start getting too nerdy or not into something like make sure we,

06:32.400 --> 06:38.880
we bring it back around. So, all right. Okay. Let's get started. Okay, guys. So we're going

06:38.880 --> 06:44.640
to set up a, it's a different type of search campaign. The first one that we set up is a call

06:44.640 --> 06:49.440
only ad. So today we're going to set up one. That's going to be a website traffic ad, but it's

06:49.440 --> 06:53.600
good. It still has the options to get calls. It's just, it's just displayed a little differently.

06:54.400 --> 07:00.000
They're both valuable in a perfect world. I would set up call only and the website traffic, but

07:00.000 --> 07:05.040
sometimes when you do that, you like double your ad spend. So for today, today we're going to do,

07:08.960 --> 07:14.160
we're going to set up a one for an Atlanta towing site. This is a one pager,

07:14.160 --> 07:20.960
right? Super simple. We only one pager for towing. Obviously like call only would be better

07:20.960 --> 07:26.160
for towing, but we're going to set this up with website traffic. And then I can always change

07:26.160 --> 07:30.480
this later on the other end of it, but for display purposes, we're going to do this. So

07:30.480 --> 07:34.640
we've created the campaign, right? We do that just like in the, in the original training,

07:34.640 --> 07:38.240
you go to your MCC, you set up your sub account, and then you go from there.

07:38.800 --> 07:43.280
Okay. So we're going to set up new campaign. Okay. We're going to come to here. It's going

07:43.280 --> 07:48.160
to ask us like what our guidance is, right? So we're going to select website traffic.

07:48.720 --> 07:52.000
And then it's going to ask us what platform we want to be on. And we're going to say search.

07:53.200 --> 07:57.280
Okay. Now it's going to ask our website. We're going to go here.

07:58.480 --> 08:03.280
We're going to copy that. We're going to paste that in. We're going to say, yeah, man,

08:03.360 --> 08:08.560
page view for sure. Then we're going to put here.

08:21.520 --> 08:26.000
This stuff right here, like I'm not a huge fan of giving Google all my data

08:26.000 --> 08:28.320
because we're doing Legion, but you do you.

08:28.320 --> 08:36.160
Okay. Bidding. You could do conversions or clicks. I prefer to do max clicks, especially

08:36.160 --> 08:41.920
at the beginning as I'm getting data. I'm then a fan at like month three or four moving into

08:41.920 --> 08:47.120
conversions, because there's going to be all of this data that Google's compiled. And then it's

08:47.120 --> 08:52.720
going to help me do better conversion rates. If my experience, my opinion is if you set

08:52.720 --> 09:03.040
conversions up in the beginning, Google's going to waste more of your money. So I'm not a fan.

09:04.160 --> 09:11.440
So I go here. I go to clicks. Okay. Now what I want to do is I want to set a maximum cost per

09:11.440 --> 09:17.920
click because Google is going to always want to spend my money. It'll give me $30 clicks,

09:17.920 --> 09:28.320
$40 clicks or whatever. So in this campaign, I have several keywords that Francesca provided me.

09:29.280 --> 09:35.200
I just did Mangles. I set it up over Atlanta. You can use SEMrush. I just prefer Mangles for local

09:35.200 --> 09:42.400
because I use Ahrefs for like other stuff. So the one I put in was towing. That's right here.

09:42.960 --> 09:47.200
You can see the CPC, the search volume, and then these are some of my other keywords that we're

09:47.200 --> 09:52.240
going to use. And you can see search volume and CPC. Now this is what Mangles says. This has been

09:52.240 --> 09:57.360
a question I've seen a couple of times. SEMrush says this. Mangles says that. But then it's actually

09:57.360 --> 10:01.760
this. Okay. But remember, this is used as a guidance. This tells us if it's good or not

10:01.760 --> 10:06.240
or if we want to, you know, kind of what to expect or budget for. But when I'm actually here,

10:06.960 --> 10:12.160
okay, when I'm actually in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my tools and settings.

10:12.800 --> 10:17.120
I'm going to click it. I'm going to go to my keyword planner. I'm going to right click that.

10:17.120 --> 10:28.400
I'm going to open it in a new link. Okay. I'm going to hit discover new keywords and then I'm going to

10:28.400 --> 10:43.760
do a couple of different. What was one? Keys locked in car? Locked keys. Oh yeah. Locked car keys.

10:47.120 --> 10:51.680
Something like that. And then I'm going to change this to Atlanta.

10:52.560 --> 10:59.600
I have specific like areas in Atlanta. Do you want me to tell you or we can go back and do that later?

11:01.040 --> 11:07.920
We will do that, but let's do that a little later. Because what this step is, that's a good

11:07.920 --> 11:12.800
question. This step is just trying, we're trying to like get what Google is going to tell us our

11:12.800 --> 11:18.880
high and low range of CPC so we can set our max limit. And so we don't have to be as specific as

11:19.680 --> 11:25.120
unless you're like going to go completely outside of the metro area, then we don't necessarily need

11:25.120 --> 11:30.720
that. Does that make sense? It's like if we were going to run it in like Stone Mountain, but call

11:30.720 --> 11:34.640
it Atlanta, then we would definitely want to look over that area. But if we're going to be in and

11:34.640 --> 11:39.040
around this area, that's fine. It's like the New Orleans one where we like, we just use New Orleans

11:39.040 --> 11:44.800
because that's going to have the most data, right? Yeah. Okay. So we hit save and then we hit get

11:45.600 --> 11:50.320
results. Okay. And then here we go. So remember like that 1,600, like those are similar

11:52.160 --> 11:58.320
results on what I saw here, maybe a little bit more, a little bit. Yeah, similar, close enough,

11:59.040 --> 12:06.160
not totally off. Okay. And then I'm going to go here and it's going to be a little bit more

12:06.320 --> 12:11.840
high and top of page bid low. In a perfect world, we always want to be higher than the high bid,

12:11.840 --> 12:17.440
but you can see like, these are like $2 higher than what we got from Mangles right now for some of

12:17.440 --> 12:24.880
these keywords. It's not that one's better or one's worse. It's just, these are just differences in

12:24.880 --> 12:30.560
the tools. And then we're going to go ahead and hit save and then we're going to go ahead and hit

12:31.440 --> 12:36.000
it. It's not that one's better or one's worse. It's just, these are just differences in the tools.

12:36.800 --> 12:42.720
But I like to go here and just see what CPC is like, I want to spend $15 for locked car keys.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.600
Maybe, maybe not. I don't know what the customer makes on it. So, but I also see how low that is.

12:49.600 --> 12:57.200
And then I look at these at being like $8, $7, $8. What's this one, another car locksmith. Okay. So

12:57.200 --> 13:02.960
the locksmith ones are higher. That's fine. We want to get those, the tow jobs, mostly these

13:02.960 --> 13:07.280
guys like doing the tow jobs. Sometimes there's people that are specific about getting keys out

13:07.280 --> 13:14.320
and all that. So what we'll do is we look around here. So it looks like $8, $7, I see $9 record

13:14.320 --> 13:19.920
service. That's, that's going to be typically like that term is typically like a bigger tow service

13:19.920 --> 13:24.640
or bigger tow truck. So just looking around, let's see.

13:28.320 --> 13:34.880
Okay. So I'm going to kind of use like this one. So we're going to choose $8.75 as our max click,

13:34.880 --> 13:39.280
because that's about, that'll put me a penny higher than a majority of what these main keywords are.

13:39.840 --> 13:48.000
Okay. So I'm going to go back to here and then hit and that's that. Okay. So I hope that's,

13:48.000 --> 13:53.600
hope you guys understand why we're doing that. And, and we'll go from there.

13:54.400 --> 13:59.920
Eman Coles asks, can we do an analytics and GTM conversion tracking overview for calls and forms?

14:04.160 --> 14:08.640
Yeah, I, yeah, we can set that up for a future office hours. I'm not going to do it today though.

14:11.280 --> 14:15.520
Okay. Now with towing, like this is one that's interesting for like towing,

14:15.600 --> 14:21.200
you can set up only bid for new customers, but I always figure like if someone's like looking

14:21.200 --> 14:25.760
and then they go to look and they come back, like you don't want that ad to not be displayed to them

14:25.760 --> 14:30.400
when they're going to make the call. So I kind of leave it off. It becomes an issue. Then we'll,

14:30.400 --> 14:35.520
we'll change it. Then you go here. So the next step it's going to remember it's going to be on

14:35.520 --> 14:39.760
the search network, but look at this, even here, they want to automatically put you on the search

14:39.760 --> 14:44.560
partners and display network, but we were going to get off of those. So we uncheck those and then

14:44.560 --> 14:49.360
it's going to ask us for our locations. Okay. So here we're going to hit enter location

14:50.160 --> 14:57.840
and then Francesca, you have a few sites for us, right? Yes. Let me pull it up.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.080
It's in my email. Just give me one second.

15:04.080 --> 15:14.640
Okay. So I have

15:18.640 --> 15:21.840
Lake city, which I have no idea what it's at.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.280
Does it exist?

15:34.160 --> 15:38.480
Yep. There it is. Funny how as I typed it in, it gave me a zip code.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.880
Yeah. Then there's east point.

15:45.280 --> 15:50.640
There it is. East point, Georgia. Then I have union city.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.880
Okay. And then he just said college. I wonder if,

15:59.840 --> 16:04.800
if it's that college park that I saw earlier, when you type the union city.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.480
That's it. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.640
Okay. We could definitely run it. I mean, we have some good, we have some,

16:26.720 --> 16:32.560
we have some good numbers there. Like there's some stretches here of like the interstate.

16:35.760 --> 16:41.600
I'm trying to remember. It's been so long since I've done anything in Atlanta.

16:41.600 --> 16:46.240
Can you do it by, should we do it by radius or not really?

16:46.240 --> 16:50.800
Well, we could, but like, you know, there's areas of Atlanta he may not want to serve or go into,

16:50.800 --> 16:53.040
because it's kind of a pain in the butt getting around there. So

16:53.760 --> 16:55.600
um, there's no way for us to like,

16:57.920 --> 17:07.120
and dry. Um, well, yeah, we can. It's just, we don't know where he wants to go. That's specific

17:07.120 --> 17:14.000
where he wants to go, but like, we can make like, um, yeah, if you, I'll tell you what, um,

17:15.440 --> 17:21.280
maybe after this call, if you want to like, maybe talk to him or met tomorrow or something and just,

17:21.280 --> 17:25.440
just ask, like, do you want those specific locations or is there like a radius you want

17:25.440 --> 17:29.200
to set up? You can just tell them like, Hey, like something like, Hey, we're, we want to set up

17:29.200 --> 17:33.680
getting some ads going just to like, get you some quick wins while we're ranking stuff. Like, you

17:33.680 --> 17:38.640
know, I got these areas, but is there like a certain like region or, or, you know, maybe give

17:38.640 --> 17:42.960
them some of these other names that you see and see if he's cool with that. Cause sometimes people

17:42.960 --> 17:48.000
are like, Oh, I don't want to go into that neighborhood at all. Um, so you can hit them up.

17:48.560 --> 17:54.000
Yeah. And they will make changes on that. Is that okay? Yeah. Okay. Cause this is a pretty

17:54.000 --> 18:02.480
good population with right now. So, um, okay, we go to there. So we set that up everybody. Um,

18:02.480 --> 18:10.240
and then we go to location options. And now towing is an interesting one because like,

18:10.240 --> 18:15.680
we want to do like typically like presence of like people in or regularly in the targeted area,

18:15.680 --> 18:19.120
but a towing, like, especially near an airport, like you could have tourists,

18:19.680 --> 18:24.640
you can have people there for business. You can have, you know, uh, family members watching

18:24.640 --> 18:30.320
people play sports, like playoffs are coming up, like all sorts of stuff. So like in this particular

18:30.320 --> 18:36.480
one, typically like for our like home service technicians, we want to have the presence one

18:36.480 --> 18:40.960
right here. We want that one targeted because we don't want that, but for towing, cause those

18:40.960 --> 18:45.200
people want it now. We don't really care where they're at. We just want them in our area.

18:45.760 --> 18:50.640
So this one, we might want to try this presence or interest. So people that are like,

18:50.640 --> 18:55.200
like here and they're interested in that, that might be something to play with on a towing niche.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.760
But for right now, I'm just going to turn this on and we'll see if we need to switch it later.

18:59.760 --> 19:07.760
Okay. And languages, English, the audience segment, like we're not really getting involved with that

19:07.760 --> 19:15.840
with what we're doing. Okay. We want this off and we go here. Um, Francesca, 24 hour towing.

19:17.440 --> 19:25.920
Yeah. Cool. All right. And then we hit next. Okay. I'm going to go up here and we're going

19:25.920 --> 19:38.320
to add our keywords and stuff. Okay. And now it's going to add, it's going to add that one.

19:39.120 --> 19:48.720
Here's all of Google's keywords that they want to, that they want to do. Um, those are interesting.

19:55.920 --> 20:12.480
Okay. All right. So I've put in, um, the main ones here that Francesca gave me, um, into this

20:12.480 --> 20:18.000
website, add this AdWords wrapper. And this helps me do a proper format that I don't have to

20:18.800 --> 20:24.640
like, um, go into here and like Adam and put the quotations or the brackets or whatever.

20:24.640 --> 20:30.160
And just as a reminder, when I have like a word that has nothing around it, that's called the

20:30.160 --> 20:36.080
broad match. When I have it with the quotation marks around it, that's called the phrase match.

20:36.080 --> 20:41.360
And when I have these brackets around it, that's called an exact match. Um, broad match means like

20:41.360 --> 20:45.520
anything closely related to that. It's going to show an ads on. That's like what we saw

20:45.520 --> 20:48.720
with the search campaigns. If I put quotations around it,

20:48.800 --> 20:54.000
what that's saying is like, let's say I typed in, like, what is the best 24 seven roadside

20:54.000 --> 20:58.480
assistance near me? My ads going to show, because that phrase is included in the search query.

20:59.280 --> 21:07.840
If I put the bracket around it, it's only going to show up for that exact search query. Okay.

21:08.880 --> 21:14.160
I prefer for lead gen and what we're trying to do and getting some data is the phrase match.

21:14.400 --> 21:18.640
You can always make tweaks later. Um, you can do broad match, but I only do that if I just have

21:18.640 --> 21:23.680
zero idea what's going to work or not. And I just want to see what sticks. Okay. But typically

21:23.680 --> 21:31.760
that's going to be a big waste of ad spend. Um, okay. So we're going to go here. I go here and

21:31.760 --> 21:38.240
click wrap keywords, wraps, my keywords. I go here where it says phrase match. I'm going to

21:38.240 --> 21:44.320
click wrap keywords, wraps, my keywords. I go here where it says phrase match. It's

21:44.320 --> 21:55.920
formatted in for me. I select it. I copy it. I go back. I go back here. Um, I'm going to

21:55.920 --> 22:04.320
do this real quick before I delete those other ones. Um, and Francesca with this, like these

22:04.400 --> 22:10.720
24 hour ones, were you guys getting any, um, like 24 hour stuff on your search terms?

22:11.920 --> 22:18.640
I just want to make sure that we have. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to try. I'm going to add like

22:18.640 --> 22:26.960
road service. That's, that's probably a decent one. Um, maybe keys locked in car.

22:34.560 --> 22:38.240
So sometimes Google doesn't give you good suggestions, but for something like this,

22:38.240 --> 22:44.160
it's like, that might be, might be helpful. Um, especially like the overnight hour,

22:44.160 --> 22:48.960
someone's going to be looking for like that all day one, you know? Um,

22:55.040 --> 22:58.240
okay. So you guys can see like, right, we're just kind of adding them. You can see that I'm

22:58.240 --> 23:04.720
putting these quotations on them. Right. And so like road service, keys locked in car, like,

23:06.080 --> 23:12.400
you know, that'll, that phrase match will cover 24 hour, 24 seven. Um, you know,

23:13.440 --> 23:19.040
who can get my keys locked in my car? Like type of thing, you know, those type of phrases,

23:19.040 --> 23:26.800
roadside assistance. I think we already got roadside. Do you have roadside? Let's do roadside.

23:26.800 --> 23:31.440
Yeah, we have roadside. All right. Cool. Okay. Now I'm going to delete all these

23:32.240 --> 23:37.920
Google suggested ones because Google likes money.

23:41.600 --> 23:48.000
Okay. So we're going to set those up. Okay. And now

23:51.040 --> 23:54.720
I'm going to hit, I can have that set. I'm going to go down here real quick. I'm just going to hit

23:56.800 --> 24:07.280
done. It's just like my stupid way of saving it. Okay. All right. Um, okay. So now we're going to

24:07.280 --> 24:15.120
go up here. We got towing Atlanta. We believe, and we can just put, um, like towing services.

24:16.240 --> 24:21.520
Okay. And now it's going to ask for headlines. And just like in the last time we want to try

24:21.520 --> 24:25.920
to get this to like good or to excellent good is going to be about three fourths of the way

24:25.920 --> 24:30.800
around the circle. Excellent. It's going to be all the way around the circle. Um, we definitely

24:30.800 --> 24:36.640
want those to be there and we add headlines that are, um, that are geared towards our

24:37.520 --> 24:44.080
main keywords and or services. Um, sometimes if you're not sure, like, um, Google will make

24:44.080 --> 24:51.520
some suggestions for you. Okay. And you can use some of those and, um, and then get that going

24:51.520 --> 25:14.960
for you. So, um. May not allow that, but we're going to see if it'll let me keep the 24 seven

25:14.960 --> 25:18.400
that.

25:18.640 --> 25:29.840
Okay.

25:43.360 --> 25:45.840
Remember how we were doing this the other day? Like they give you these,

25:46.800 --> 25:49.280
like they give you some of these to use, which are great

25:51.440 --> 25:57.280
if they coincide with your website, your web headlines and your keywords. It's great.

26:15.840 --> 26:27.280
Um, do they do gas service, gas fuel? Like, do they bring gasoline?

26:46.720 --> 26:50.560
I don't know if that's the actual search term used, but that's what Google picked up. So I'm

26:50.560 --> 26:54.640
just going to go with it now and we'll double check it. As you know, like once we set this up

26:54.640 --> 26:58.800
a couple, two, three days later, it'll tell us something. It'll make different suggestions

26:58.800 --> 27:10.640
for us, but we'll try to do that. Um, let's see. Okay. That's awesome. You guys hear the

27:10.800 --> 27:18.080
gardener? Go inside and listen to kids. Can you hear the gardener next door?

27:18.960 --> 27:22.640
I don't. Oh, good. Okay. Maybe these headphones work. Awesome.

27:35.040 --> 27:39.200
Is this person a AAA roadside? Do they take AAA? Do you know?

27:39.840 --> 27:44.800
No, no. Okay. I'll put it on the list of things to ask.

27:44.800 --> 27:52.400
Okay.

28:45.600 --> 28:52.400
Okay.

28:52.800 --> 28:56.000
Okay.

29:07.440 --> 29:12.000
Let's see what other keywords can we throw in there?

29:16.880 --> 29:20.560
I'll leave space for like the AAA. If you can find that out, that'd be cool.

29:20.560 --> 29:26.800
Um, maybe like affordable towing. That's not really a big one to trick service.

29:50.560 --> 30:02.080
Do you know if they have like heavy equipment, like heavy wreckers or like are they just doing

30:02.080 --> 30:10.640
cars? Do you know? Um, well, like accidents. Yeah. Sometimes like, like some, some local areas,

30:10.640 --> 30:15.520
like a wrecker will be like certain type of tow trucks. Sometimes they're the bigger ones or

30:15.520 --> 30:20.640
like they have the cranes on them or the booms or something. I have to ask. Okay.

30:22.720 --> 30:25.360
Okay. I would, yeah, I would leave it if you want.

30:28.480 --> 30:32.480
Yeah. Okay. Let's see. What else can we do here?

30:33.200 --> 30:34.720
Boom.

30:38.000 --> 30:38.720
We'll see if I can get one.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.680
There you go. Um,

30:55.280 --> 31:01.280
like did you already put flat tire, um, like repair or something like that? So I think you put.

31:01.280 --> 31:07.520
I think I did. I put something. I put flat tire replacement. I'll put flat tire repair.

31:21.360 --> 31:26.960
And I'm going to leave this one open in case we do AAA or like an insurance brand or something.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.480
I'll leave that one open, but we're already at excellent. So that's good.

31:31.280 --> 31:37.680
Um, and we didn't even try a description yet. Um, okay. Do you guys have, I know you guys have used

31:37.680 --> 31:42.800
towing before. Do you guys have some descriptions that you've used in the past that you're aware of?

31:43.840 --> 31:48.400
The only, um, till we know we do, we actually don't even run ads anymore.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.680
But I can.

31:55.280 --> 31:59.440
That's okay. I'm going to stop the share real quick and I'm going to go through my computer.

31:59.440 --> 32:04.800
Fine. Some stuff that I've written down. Well, we may have.

32:04.800 --> 32:31.200
I'll bring my screen back up. Everybody. I'm just moving stuff around in my window. So,

32:32.080 --> 32:33.120
and then I'll share it again.

32:39.040 --> 32:45.520
Like when I don't know, I just use Nick's stuff because it works.

32:46.880 --> 32:49.200
Don't know why it works, but it works. Right. Okay.

32:49.200 --> 33:02.320
Okay. Okay. Here we are. We are back. Okay. So we just, I just copied, uh,

33:02.320 --> 33:12.240
what we use right with the group. So, um, that's fine. Uh, we specialize and

33:12.320 --> 33:17.360
and towing

33:22.720 --> 33:23.680
not keys,

33:29.200 --> 33:32.960
but tire repair

33:33.680 --> 33:38.640
and more call for free quote, the local, affordable

33:40.880 --> 33:45.680
professional, the truck company

33:52.640 --> 33:57.360
and the Atlanta area. Okay. So we'll call those good for right now. We'll come up with some other

33:57.440 --> 34:03.040
ones later, um, and do that. Okay. So for everyone following along. So, so far, we've set everything

34:03.040 --> 34:09.200
up. Um, we spent the time to put in the headlines. It showed you how like Google will help you

34:09.200 --> 34:13.600
sometimes. Sometimes it doesn't, but a lot of times it does. But you want to remember, like we

34:13.600 --> 34:18.640
also went into keyword planner, where I looked at some volume and stuff and I'm able to see some of

34:18.640 --> 34:23.920
the main keywords and I just use some variants. And just by doing that, I'm going to be able to

34:24.080 --> 34:29.280
keywords and I just use some variants. And just by doing that, like I already started off my ad

34:30.000 --> 34:34.960
strength into excellent, which is good in three, four days, it's going to be different, but it's

34:34.960 --> 34:39.440
always helpful to start off there. And then you can always change it from there. The descriptions

34:39.440 --> 34:43.440
that just stick with the simple one that works. You don't have to get too fancy, but you can do

34:43.440 --> 34:51.280
that. Um, so because this is a, a single, um, uh, a single one pager, we're not going to do site

34:51.280 --> 34:56.640
links. Um, we're not going to do call outs. Okay. But one thing we're going to add here,

34:57.360 --> 35:01.760
so we're going to, so I went here, it says more assets. I'm going to scroll down and I'm going

35:01.760 --> 35:07.600
to add a phone number and add calls. So I'm going to add that to this, right? I'm going to go to the

35:07.600 --> 35:21.120
website, copy that, put that in there, like, give us a call. Right. Okay. And I can now

35:21.520 --> 35:28.480
this part, because it's a 24 hour service, I can leave this on for the calls. But let's say that

35:28.480 --> 35:34.880
like I was setting up, setting this up for like, um, you know, like Francesca's tree trimming site,

35:34.880 --> 35:40.080
um, like maybe she doesn't want to get calls all night and all day. So like I will,

35:40.880 --> 35:47.440
I will set her, her, um, maybe set up the call part, like this little call add-on. I only let

35:47.440 --> 35:53.440
this run during like maybe 30 to 45 minutes before and after close of business. Um, and then

35:53.440 --> 35:59.840
everything else will be running other than that. So then we'll hit save. We'll say, cool. We hit

35:59.840 --> 36:05.280
apply. It applies that to that. You don't have to worry about snippets, lead forms, any of that

36:05.280 --> 36:12.960
other stuff at this point. We hit done. We hit next. Now it's going to ask for our daily budget.

36:13.280 --> 36:18.640
Um, so it doesn't, let me see if I can do this here. So sometimes,

36:20.240 --> 36:23.040
sometimes it gives us estimates. A lot of times it doesn't.

36:26.960 --> 36:34.000
Okay. Um, but knowing that like Atlanta, it was like eight something. So, um, there's definitely

36:34.000 --> 36:40.080
a lot of money in, in towing. Um, so what we're going to do is we're going to start off with like

36:40.080 --> 36:47.440
$55 a day. Um, and then as soon as I type that in, I haven't agreed to this yet, but you can see

36:47.440 --> 36:52.880
right here, like it given me an idea of how many weekly clicks I can get, what the weekly cost is,

36:52.880 --> 36:57.680
and then what the average CPC is. Like, I don't know how accurate that is right away, but it gives

36:57.680 --> 37:02.960
you a good starting point. Okay. So we're going to start off with that. And only cause this is

37:02.960 --> 37:08.800
towing and it's in the Atlanta area. So it's going to be, and, and, and Francesca can,

37:08.800 --> 37:13.920
can chime in on this. Like you make your money and a lot of volume and towing. And so you want

37:13.920 --> 37:18.000
their phones ringing all the time. That's how they pay you. And that's why they keep paying more.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.840
Right. Okay. And you guys are working on going to probably, you guys have a full website coming up

37:23.840 --> 37:30.320
and doing the SEO and all that stuff. I'm sure at some point. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we'll go ahead and

37:30.320 --> 37:30.880
hit next.

37:39.200 --> 37:44.560
Okay. So you guys see up here, you'll see in the video I made earlier today,

37:44.560 --> 37:48.480
I talked about how we want this to be up to a hundred. Don't worry about that right now,

37:48.480 --> 37:52.560
because Google's like wanting to add all these things that just going to take your money away.

37:52.560 --> 37:57.680
But remember, like we're going to hit publish. It's going to take two days of policy review

37:57.680 --> 38:03.840
and then five days of learning before anything really like good happens. So we're not, I don't

38:03.840 --> 38:08.080
mess with them. When I first set it up, I set it up, I let it sit for two or three days. And then

38:08.080 --> 38:14.080
I come in and then I make some of the recommendation changes to increase my optimization score.

38:14.080 --> 38:18.720
And then we do that with this one. We'll pop on and we'll either record it and post it,

38:18.720 --> 38:23.120
or I'll pop in live like I did earlier and show you the changes and how to get it back up to a

38:23.120 --> 38:33.840
hundred on this site. And let's go through here. I just kind of overview what I'm seeing. Yeah.

38:34.400 --> 38:38.640
Okay. And you can see up here guys, like this is one of the things like it wants me to add

38:38.640 --> 38:43.920
site links to get my optimization score up, but I don't have any other web pages because it's a

38:43.920 --> 38:47.920
single pager. So it makes no sense to do site links. Right. And I'll show you how to get around

38:47.920 --> 39:00.400
that. And we hit publish. And there we go. So we are now under review. Here you go. We got policy

39:00.400 --> 39:05.200
review and it'll give us some impressions and some clicks. And then it'll kick us into the

39:05.200 --> 39:11.040
learning right here. Eligible learning. That's a five day, that's a five day process post

39:11.040 --> 39:15.280
passing policy review. And then it just gives you a summary of everything.

39:16.960 --> 39:21.680
And then I think that's it. Francesca, is there anything that I can

39:23.920 --> 39:28.000
go over that you think I missed or didn't explain well enough or anything like that?

39:28.240 --> 39:33.040
I think you did really good. The only thing that I can think of, maybe people will be like,

39:33.040 --> 39:40.320
wow, that's a lot of money per day. But it is a little different because I usually will keep in

39:40.320 --> 39:45.520
mind the first one or two days, obviously it's not really doing anything. And even afterwards,

39:45.520 --> 39:53.360
but I do keep checking it to see how much we're actually spending. We just want to set it high

39:53.360 --> 40:01.760
enough that it will produce, especially at first. Yeah. Yeah. And also re-emphasize on that point,

40:01.760 --> 40:07.280
this is Atlanta. It's a large metro area. So this is not something that you want to do as a beginning

40:07.280 --> 40:12.720
student. This is not where you want to set up your first Legion app, right? Nick and Francesca have

40:12.720 --> 40:18.240
been doing this for a few years. They got a lot of experience. They get clients that come to them

40:18.240 --> 40:22.880
from big areas because they know they can do big stuff. So when you do that, you get people,

40:22.880 --> 40:28.960
you have to run bigger budgets for them. You can't run a $15 a day budget and expect results for

40:28.960 --> 40:35.120
Atlanta for Tony. This is not going to happen. But that's a great point. We've had some other areas

40:35.120 --> 40:42.160
where like, you know, just because you put $55 a day doesn't mean it's going to spend $55 a day.

40:43.440 --> 40:47.360
This campaign may because there's a lot of volume and we'll make those adjustments,

40:47.360 --> 40:53.040
but like we have the, there's the landscape or yeah, there's a landscape one we were working on

40:53.680 --> 41:00.880
and we've had to adjust the budget higher to a lot for more potential clicks per day. But I don't

41:00.880 --> 41:06.480
think we've hit the budget once, like the daily budget. We haven't even come close to it, right?

41:08.000 --> 41:16.640
Yeah. So, okay. I think that's it. Okay. We're going to look at the group and see if there's

41:16.640 --> 41:22.480
been any questions and then we'll get out of here for the day. We'll call it a day.

41:23.680 --> 41:30.080
We have one person watching. So big, probably me. I think it's me watching me and you right now.

41:30.080 --> 41:35.120
So that's cool. All right, guys, does anybody have any comments? Because we're going to,

41:35.120 --> 41:41.680
we're going to kill this in a minute if nobody does. So we tried.

41:42.240 --> 41:50.400
It will be pinned anyway. So I know it exists. I see that they watch this. I see the comments.

41:50.400 --> 41:57.600
Yeah. It's funny. All right. We'll give them. Yeah. Thank you. I'm going to give them like

41:57.600 --> 42:04.560
15 seconds and then we're going to kick out. So just because of the delay. Yeah. The delay is weird.

42:05.600 --> 42:08.480
I always laugh at Nick because like, he's like, okay, bye. And you're like,

42:09.200 --> 42:14.480
what? He just, where'd he go? He doesn't even finish the by when he sits out. I think it's funny.

42:14.480 --> 42:18.640
And my videos are probably the same. I have to say, I've never watched one of my videos to the end.

42:18.640 --> 42:23.600
So I don't know. All right. Okay. I'm not seeing any comments come in. So we're going to,

42:23.600 --> 42:28.720
we're going to end it. Thank you again for hopping on and helping. Thank you. Everyone

42:28.720 --> 42:33.520
appreciate your experience and expertise in it. So, all right. We'll talk to you later. All right.

42:33.520 --> 42:35.920
Bye. Okay. Bye.
