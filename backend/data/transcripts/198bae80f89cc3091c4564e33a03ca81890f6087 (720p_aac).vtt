Top keyword or keywords. That's one of the mistakes I made you have to do multiple keywords when I was in these other groups

00:06.920 --> 00:11.040
I thought you just went in and let's say it's concrete or concrete contractors

00:11.040 --> 00:14.440
You just type in concrete contractors st

00:14.440 --> 00:18.940
George, Utah, and if it looks good you send it and if it doesn't you don't guys

00:19.120 --> 00:26.920
You're gonna be ranking for different keywords that keyword might be super difficult and the other four or five six

00:26.920 --> 00:30.120
67 are layups, dude. No one's competing

00:30.120 --> 00:37.000
I'll go and take all the traffic for those four rank for those four and that's gonna help and it's gonna bleed over and

00:37.000 --> 00:40.600
It's gonna allow me to rank quicker for the main keyword, right?

00:40.600 --> 00:48.160
If the main keywords concrete likewise are on the flip side you go and do the research and that top keyword is a laydown

00:48.160 --> 00:52.880
Oh, man, there's not even dude all the people in the maps. They don't even have a website shit

00:52.960 --> 00:59.880
It's gonna be easy little do you know if you looked at six keywords the other five they're gonna be a beast, dude

00:59.880 --> 01:02.800
They're gonna be a bitch. It's gonna be really difficult for you to rank

01:02.800 --> 01:07.120
And if you looked at the big picture, you'd realize yeah, you might be able to rank for that keyword

01:07.120 --> 01:09.580
But there's a lot more traffic hiding over here

01:09.580 --> 01:14.560
So it's got to be multiple keywords and in the training we talk about how to build that keyword list

01:14.560 --> 01:18.080
But here's what also school we have 400 plus members in here Theo

01:18.080 --> 01:21.280
If you have a niche you're looking at just ask what key what's the keyword list?

01:21.280 --> 01:26.960
Okay, and I'll probably say have you already built one? Let me see it and I'll then I'll send you mine

01:26.960 --> 01:28.960
Okay, I've got nothing to hide. I'm happy to share
