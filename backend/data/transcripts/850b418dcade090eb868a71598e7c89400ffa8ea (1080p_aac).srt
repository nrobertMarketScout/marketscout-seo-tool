1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,960
Alright guys, let's talk about the one pager, what we need to absolutely include.

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,240
I'm gonna call this the 1.2 million dollar template and the reason why is because I have

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,920
literally spent that much money on Google at the time of recording this and by doing

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,960
that, I've been able to test a lot of things on landing pages.

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,880
I've been able to test if the picture should go here, if the website or if the quote form

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,560
should go right there, what questions we should ask, how big should the phone number be, where

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,560
should we put this.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,080
I've tested all that stuff over the course of 1.2 million dollars and I'm going to show

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,360
you the template that if you can replicate this, you are going to be fine.

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,400
You can add your own little flavors, but I'm gonna go over some of the non-negotiables

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,080
that you must include on this one page template.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,800
Again, this is something you have to do right once, so take your time, just like the keyword

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
list.

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,240
Do the keyword list correctly.

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,320
Do the one pager well the first time and guess what?

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,360
Next time, you just copy and paste, you swap out the, hey, instead of concrete, it's tree

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
surface.

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Instead of tree surface, it's this, okay?

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,480
You swap out the phone number, maybe you swap out the colors, swap out the pictures and

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,200
the content, done, done and done.

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,320
Okay, so take your time and make this really, really good.

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,520
All right, guys, so here you can see a quick example of what I would consider a perfect

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
landing page.

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,760
I know some of you guys that are coming from WordPress backgrounds or you have the design

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,640
out, you're like, oh my gosh, this?

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
Like this right here?

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
Yes, this, okay?

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,160
Let me tell you about this, okay?

29
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,440
You're looking at albuquerqueconcrete.weebly.com.

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:50,820
I built this, actually I didn't, my team built this website a year and two months ago, okay?

31
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,100
We did our regular process that we teach in here, we ran ads, we went and found a business

32
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,020
owner, we closed the deal, awesome, okay?

33
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:05,420
And something happened and that is I forgot to follow up and have my project manager build

34
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,420
the actual website.

35
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,060
We got the deal and we forgot to build the website, okay?

36
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,700
So about, oh, was it about a month and a half ago, I reached out to Francesca and I said,

37
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,540
Francesca, give me a rankings report on these cities, okay?

38
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,460
And so she went through and one of the cities was albuquerqueconcrete.

39
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,660
So I was looking at the rankings report and I said, oh, where's the rankings for that

40
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,660
one?

41
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,660
Because I was just looking at that client.

42
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,940
And she said, yeah, I was gonna tell you about that, she's like, we don't have a website

43
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,940
for that one.

44
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,380
I'm like, what do you mean we don't have a website for that one?

45
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,460
She's like, yeah, we don't have a website for that one.

46
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,340
We've been running ads to the one pager for a year.

47
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,620
So guys, I had done the deal at whatever, let's call it a thousand bucks, I can't remember

48
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,540
the exact specifics on that deal, a thousand bucks.

49
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,900
I was spending 500, and in this case, I think it was even less.

50
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,180
And I was making the difference, 500 to 700 dollars of profit the entire time, even though

51
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,180
I didn't have a website.

52
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,300
I just set up the ads and I was pushing the leads and I had the credit card involved and

53
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,060
I was arbitraging this thing.

54
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,380
So I know this doesn't look great.

55
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,740
I know it's like, this is very basic.

56
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,860
I know, I know, I know, but guess what?

57
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,860
It works.

58
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,460
It works, it works, it works, and it will produce leads.

59
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,440
So let's take a look at some of the things you have to include, okay?

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,980
Number one, I'm just gonna show you, and you guys are free to go build your one pager on

61
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:27,980
Wix, Wordpress, I don't care, it doesn't actually matter.

62
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,260
And I'm not gonna spend time going in and showing you how to use a web builder, because

63
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,260
guys, it's not hard.

64
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:39,540
You literally go and drag stuff over, like you drag a picture over, you drag the content

65
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,540
down.

66
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,540
It's not difficult, okay?

67
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,140
Couple things I'm gonna show you, and these are like non-negotiable.

68
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,980
So number one is the phone number.

69
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,660
The phone number needs to be the centerpiece of this website.

70
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:55,460
So as you can see here on the screen, it is the centerpiece, it's the thing that pops,

71
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,020
and honestly, I think it could be even a little bit bigger.

72
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,780
Do not, and I understand, most websites, they have the big writing, it says Albuquerque

73
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,900
Concrete, like this big, right?

74
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,100
And then the phone number is this little teeny thing, probably not even underneath, it's

75
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,660
up in the corner, because it looks sleek, okay?

76
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,100
And guess what, I don't care about sleek, I care about freaking making money, and in

77
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,180
order to make money, phone needs to rain, okay?

78
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,540
So what I'm gonna do is, you need to start thinking about the customer.

79
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,500
If you have a customer looking for concrete, quit making it difficult for them to call

80
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
you.

81
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,380
Quit making it difficult for them to get ahold of you, to ask for an estimate.

82
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,840
So everything that you do, the psychology here is, how do we make this as easy as possible

83
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,500
for somebody looking for concrete to call us, and therefore grabbing that lead?

84
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,660
And one of the things is, making that phone number right there in their face, and the

85
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,500
last thing I want to point out on this phone number, is it's a click to call.

86
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,940
Meaning, I highlighted it, and I did a call, an action button, which means if they click

87
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,940
on it, it's immediately going to call directly to the phone number, which is the tracking

88
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,220
number, which goes to the business owner.

89
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,580
And the best thing to do there is, I like to, so link it up, make sure it's click to

90
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,140
call, and I like to add an underline.

91
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,260
A lot of times on these web builders, when you make it click to call, it adds the underline.

92
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,380
I am going to tell you right now, go and manually add the underline, because it just triggers

93
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,740
in people's brain, oh, I can click on that, it's a link, it's a phone number.

94
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,260
So that is a click to call, you can see.

95
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,260
So add that.

96
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,500
You honestly, I just include this somewhere on the screen, not as important as the phone

97
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
number.

98
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,020
Phone number, that's the number one non-negotiable, needs to be big, bold, center, and it needs

99
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,700
to be click to call.

100
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,900
Next thing is this quote form.

101
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,940
And there's a right way to do this, and there's a wrong way to do this.

102
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,380
One thing that I think helps a lot is with the quote form making it pop.

103
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,540
And one thing that I've found to make it pop is to make it have a background.

104
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,900
Okay, so you can see right here, this isn't just like a quote form that says free instant

105
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,740
quote and it's kind of tucked in the corner, right?

106
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,740
It's not.

107
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,180
It is, it's got a background, it just kind of pops against that white.

108
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,420
So I would encourage you to do the same, okay?

109
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:09,740
And another couple things about this quote form is make it seem as if when they fill

110
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,340
this out, they put in their information, they put in what concrete surface they need, the

111
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:21,100
square footage, all that, make it almost seem like as soon as they push get my quote, they're

112
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,900
gonna get an immediate email.

113
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,220
I want it to seem almost like you're gonna open up your email or your text message and

114
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,140
you're gonna have a quote, okay?

115
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,540
That's the psychology behind it.

116
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,500
And guys, we are going to get them an immediate quote because we're gonna call them immediately

117
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,940
or the business owner's gonna call them immediately, okay?

118
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,820
So on the instant quote, make sure it pops.

119
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,940
I like to add the free instant quote, free instant estimate, whatever.

120
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,060
I like to make sure the word instant is in there because I want people thinking, hey,

121
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,820
I can get price quick because they're gonna get price quick, we're gonna call them.

122
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,180
I like to throw a little exclamation point.

123
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,100
You can experiment around with this plus free bonus coupon thing.

124
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,700
I don't even think that's necessary and some people are gonna watch this go, what's the

125
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,100
bonus coupon?

126
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,260
Honestly, I don't even think it's necessary.

127
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,740
So that doesn't matter, okay?

128
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,740
You can include it if you want.

129
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,340
Okay, guys, so there's a few things with this quote form that need to be done right and

130
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,020
you're probably like, I never thought that this much thought went into the quote form.

131
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,860
This much thought goes into the quote form, okay?

132
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,700
So I wanna show you what most people do.

133
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,860
So I just went ahead and I typed in Albuquerque concrete.

134
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,700
I looked at the first person ranking, okay?

135
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,260
It's this company called Duke City, whatever.

136
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,340
Now this is more like a ready mix, whatever.

137
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,020
So I know it's not necessarily the exact same thing but I just wanna prove a point without

138
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,620
spending a ton of time.

139
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,660
If you look, first of all, their quote forms are nowhere to be found, okay?

140
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,780
They're definitely not in that first like fold where you're like, oh, there's the quote

141
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,580
form, let me get a quote.

142
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,700
And side note, good luck finding the phone number.

143
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,660
I don't even see a phone number on here so we're gonna win based on that.

144
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,380
If I wanted to contact these guys, I have to work.

145
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,700
I don't want to make the customer work, okay?

146
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:08,100
So if you scroll all the way to the bottom, this is what most people do, is contact us,

147
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,260
okay?

148
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:14,100
Contact us to me as a customer, literally screams, hey, solicit me.

149
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,700
Call me and bug me, okay?

150
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:21,940
You enter your name, your email, your subject, like that just means they literally put a,

151
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,740
that just means they put no thought into this.

152
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,100
Your subject, what do you mean your subject, right?

153
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,800
And then your message, this is the dumbest thing ever, then it says submit.

154
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,460
This is such a standard BS crap, if you guys do this, I see this, I'm gonna be pissed.

155
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,460
Do not do this.

156
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,800
Contrast that, which is what 99% of people do, oh, good job by the way, Duke, find your

157
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,360
number at the bottom, not click to call, so now I have to go, I have to write it down

158
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
and then put it in.

159
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,340
Not a good strategy, but that's a side note, okay?

160
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,780
Go back to this.

161
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,380
Contrast what you just saw with this one.

162
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,820
You look at the bottom, you're looking at the screen, you're like, oh, free instant

163
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,980
quote, okay?

164
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,340
Here's the kicker, instead of just hitting them and saying, hey, free instant quote,

165
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,180
give me your name, your phone number, your email, your address, your this, your that,

166
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,900
your social security number, okay, don't do that, okay?

167
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,820
What you need to do is psychologically, we wanna get them down the rabbit hole a little

168
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,820
bit.

169
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,380
So, the first thing they see is instead of saying, hey, give me your name, we're asking

170
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,380
them a question.

171
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,780
We're saying, what concrete service do you need?

172
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,860
And they can look and go driveway, sidewalk, walkway, patio, okay, well, we were just looking

173
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,300
at, oh, or other, okay, okay, so I'm gonna choose sidewalk.

174
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,380
Approximate size, square footage of project, right, and they're like, I don't really know,

175
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,420
but look, probably more than 100, okay?

176
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,300
Now think about it like this.

177
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:49,460
The customer's already answered two questions, it says instant, and now we're like, oh, by

178
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,340
the way, give us your name and your phone number and your email, and it says, get my

179
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,160
quote.

180
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,500
This right here is a completely different and psychologically just, it's on point because

181
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,960
we're getting them, and think about it if you're a human, you're like, oh, I've already

182
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,300
answered two of the questions, I may as well just drop in my name and email and get a quote

183
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,140
in the chance that they're gonna just email it to me, right?

184
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,580
They might just email it to me.

185
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,500
So guys, the keys here to look at with this quote is make it pop, okay?

186
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:24,180
Make sure you ask one to two questions related to that service that almost make it seem like

187
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,860
they're gonna get an instant quote in the form of an email, okay?

188
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,900
Even though they are gonna get an instant quote in the form of a phone call, you almost

189
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,980
want it to be like it's an auto-generated thing, okay?

190
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,840
So ask two questions and then ask for, at the very most, name, phone number, email.

191
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,860
Now I know some people and some business owners are gonna go, hey, can you just get the addresses?

192
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,860
Can you get this?

193
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,860
Can you get that?

194
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,780
Guys, there's a fine line.

195
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,340
You ask too many questions here, people aren't, they're gonna be discouraged.

196
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,580
But when it's the name, phone number, email, things that they literally have memorized

197
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,340
and it's very simple and easy, they're willing to give it after they've answered a couple

198
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,340
questions.

199
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,740
I'm telling you right now, I've tested flipping this and asking for the name, phone number,

200
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,340
email, and then the questions.

201
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,940
I get way better conversion out of this where we ask one, two questions, okay?

202
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:16,500
And then we go name, phone number, email, boom, get my quote.

203
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,460
Guys, that is the one-pagers.

204
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,820
These are the things that are non-negotiables that have to be included and that is a bold

205
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,220
centered phone number that needs to be underlined, it needs to be clicked to call, okay?

206
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,140
It needs to be the centerpiece of your website.

207
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,340
By the way, at this stage, if you would like to use your cell phone, you can use your cell

208
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,340
phone.

209
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:39,540
However, I would recommend using a call tracking service so that it's, first of all, not your

210
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,540
phone number.

211
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,480
Second of all, you know that it came from that website.

212
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,420
Have you ever gotten your phone out and you missed calls and you're like, man, I wonder

213
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,980
if they called me from my company website, they called me from this, call me from that.

214
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,220
You don't even know, especially if you have multiple sites feeding into that phone number,

215
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,940
that's gonna get really tricky really quick because when you call, when they call, you're

216
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,300
not gonna know who it is, okay?

217
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,100
So I do recommend using a call tracking service, but it's not necessary if this is your first

218
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,820
project and you're on a thin budget.

219
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,820
I get it.

220
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,580
So make sure that's there.

221
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,860
And then the quote form, and not only the quote form, make sure it pops.

222
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,980
Make sure you ask at least two questions.

223
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,900
So for example, if it was masonry, it could say, you know, you could say, what service

224
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,020
do you need?

225
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,100
Or you could say something like, you could ask a yes, no question.

226
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,100
You could go, like one of the questions we do is, how soon do you need the service?

227
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:32,540
And we'll have an option that's like, okay, ASAP, within the week, within the month, or

228
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,140
I'm flexible, okay?

229
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:39,300
You can ask something like that, but ask at least two questions first and then name, phone

230
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,300
number, email, get my quote.

231
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,460
Anything else outside of this, I would just model over this.

232
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,340
You know, I had a couple of photos, whatever, just make it simple.

233
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,940
Lastly, this content, okay?

234
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,180
You do not have to go and write content from scratch.

235
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,420
You do not need to just go and blast out content, look at your keyword list, do the whole thing.

236
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,620
You're actually free to go and swipe this from this website if you're in concrete, from

237
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,560
another website, if you're in another niche, because, you know, taking someone's content,

238
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,840
you're gonna get what they call black box at some point.

239
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,600
If you copy content, you're gonna get in trouble with Google, they're gonna, you know, not

240
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,240
ever let your site rank.

241
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,520
But we're not trying to make the site rank because if you guys understand the process,

242
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,480
as soon as we get the deal, we're gonna use this one to push the traffic to, we're gonna

243
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,880
get the leads, but once we sign the contract, we're then gonna build out our main website

244
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,640
and that's where we're gonna take the time to build the nice content and the nice photos

245
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,760
and make sure that the site looks a little bit more presentable, et cetera.

246
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,480
This is the down and dirty.

247
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,720
Guys, include these things and remember, and by the way, I do have to say, if you would

248
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,880
like to just go and start testing stuff out, you're free to do that, but what I'm showing

249
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,400
you here, as simple as it looks, is a $1.2 million template and I say that because I've

250
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,840
spent that much money testing and tweaking and dragging and changing and this and that

251
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,600
and I've found that if you do it just like this and include these main couple of things,

252
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,760
you are gonna get leads.
