00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
I had someone reach out through referral and they recommended a city for me.

00:03.600 --> 00:07.120
I got them three leads in four days. They charge high prices and are proud of it.

00:08.720 --> 00:12.240
I got on a call with them both to close and they liked everything until it came to talking about

00:12.240 --> 00:17.360
price. One business owner said 1500 per month is fair but they have to think about it for two weeks.

00:17.360 --> 00:21.440
I wasn't able to use the method where I said I have someone on the hook. I tried to tell them

00:21.440 --> 00:24.800
I'll need to look for another business owner while they consider and they said that's fine.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.720
What could I have done differently there to have gotten them to make the decision on the phone?

00:29.360 --> 00:35.920
So basically, long story short, he wasn't able to close the deal on the spot.

00:35.920 --> 00:41.120
The one business owner said that the 1500 was fine but they need two weeks to think about it.

00:42.560 --> 00:48.080
Just a reminder, whenever you guys are getting objections, this is going back to sales 101,

00:48.080 --> 00:54.080
whether you're selling freaking ridiculously priced bottled water, shout out to Park Plaza

00:54.080 --> 00:59.680
for using glass when they don't need to, that's fine. High priced bottled water, t-shirts,

01:00.240 --> 01:05.520
freaking power banks, it doesn't matter what you're selling. If you are getting an objection

01:05.520 --> 01:13.280
from your customer, it's almost 100% of the time not what you did. It's not where the objection

01:13.280 --> 01:20.240
came that you went wrong. It's the step or a step before. Now, without getting all the context and

01:20.240 --> 01:24.320
without being there as a fly on the wall, without watching over your shoulder, without knowing

01:24.320 --> 01:31.360
exactly what was said and the timeline and all the rest, what I can tell you is that I believe,

01:31.360 --> 01:36.560
based on what you're telling me, that what happened is the setup, which is right before

01:36.560 --> 01:43.360
the close. The setup is where it went wrong. What I mean by that is that the business owner clearly

01:43.360 --> 01:49.840
felt like they could come to you and say they needed time to think about it. We don't get that.

01:49.840 --> 01:55.600
I don't get that. Our agency doesn't get that. We just don't. The reason why is because I know

01:55.600 --> 02:00.400
it's coming. Every person on this earth, every human on this earth is going to say they need

02:00.400 --> 02:04.560
to think about it because no one wants to make the wrong decision. I already know that's coming.

02:05.120 --> 02:08.800
As part of the training, what we talked about is the setup. As part of the setup, we want to

02:08.800 --> 02:13.520
eliminate objections. We don't want to wait for them. This is a prime example. When you

02:13.520 --> 02:19.280
wait for an objection to come, now you have to overcome it. When you attack the objection first,

02:19.280 --> 02:24.080
when you eliminate the objection first, it's so much easier. It takes one sentence. It takes one

02:24.080 --> 02:29.120
quick conversation. It takes one example, and it's not an issue. If you wait for the objection to

02:29.120 --> 02:36.240
come, it is almost impossible or extremely difficult to overcome. It is extremely hard

02:36.240 --> 02:42.800
to tell someone they can't think about it versus telling someone, hey, all I ask is that by the end

02:42.800 --> 02:48.880
of this call, you give me a yes or no. If it's a maybe, it's a no. That is so much easier to do.

02:49.360 --> 02:54.400
Than to wait until they object. I can tell you based on what you're telling me that you went

02:54.400 --> 03:00.800
wrong in the setup. You went wrong in not setting the expectations, not being clear that I need an

03:00.800 --> 03:04.000
answer on this. You don't need to say it like that. Hey, I need you to give me a yes or no. We don't

03:04.000 --> 03:08.400
want to spook them. Sometimes I'll say that if the business owner and me were vibing and whatever,

03:09.200 --> 03:13.200
you went wrong in the setup. That needs to be addressed. You need to either say that on the

03:13.200 --> 03:17.360
phone. What I like to bring, I like to definitely bring it up in the screencast, but I also like to

03:17.360 --> 03:21.760
bring it up on the phone call. I'm talking to these business owners. If I'm the one that's still

03:21.760 --> 03:26.240
closing deals, which I've removed myself from that aspect, thank goodness, I did that for years.

03:27.280 --> 03:31.280
I say thank goodness not because I don't like it. I love it. I say thank goodness because it's

03:31.280 --> 03:36.640
allowed me to scale now because I don't have to be there and get deals. You went wrong in the setup.

03:36.640 --> 03:41.120
You needed to bring that up in the screencast that you were going to need a decision because

03:41.120 --> 03:44.560
you need to find someone as soon as possible. These leads are valuable. It's money going down

03:44.560 --> 03:48.720
the drain. I'm going to give you some for free, but you need to let me know by the end of this.

03:48.720 --> 03:55.280
That's all I ask. Don't leave me in the whole no man's land or are you going to think about it,

03:55.280 --> 03:58.960
that kind of thing. That's all I ask from you, Mr. Business Owner. By the way, make sure that you

03:58.960 --> 04:03.440
have decision makers on the phone. There's no pressure. I've given you the leads. I'm going

04:03.440 --> 04:06.320
to show you the pricing. I'm going to go over everything. You're going to have every bit of

04:06.320 --> 04:14.240
information. That's it. You went wrong in the setup. Now, one more thing. If you do get that

04:14.240 --> 04:18.000
objection, I want to cover this really quick. Let's say you to get the objection of, I want

04:18.000 --> 04:22.560
to think about it. I need to think about it, whatever. Now, your only option is to try and

04:22.560 --> 04:29.600
overcome the objection. Again, just remember, and I think we even have this in fact almost,

04:29.600 --> 04:34.720
and I know we do, inside of the premium sales training library, which if you don't have access

04:34.720 --> 04:40.880
to it, that is the library that's for those students that are paid in full. There were some

04:40.880 --> 04:44.720
of you guys that before we started doing the funding and everything else, we're on payment

04:44.720 --> 04:49.760
plans when we used to do those internally. If you are not already, make sure you get yourself paid

04:49.760 --> 04:53.920
in full so you can have access to the premium sales training library. If you are paid in full,

04:53.920 --> 04:57.840
message Fix It Felix to get access to all that material. But in there, we have a training on

04:58.560 --> 05:05.200
Feel Felt Found. We want to make sure, just a quick recap, make sure that you let the business

05:05.200 --> 05:10.080
owner know that you feel them. Hey, I feel you. I understand. You don't want to make a wrong

05:10.080 --> 05:16.720
decision, whatever, right? Felt, you want to make sure that you let them know that another business

05:16.720 --> 05:21.120
owner felt the exact same way. You can say, I felt the same way when doing such and such a thing,

05:21.120 --> 05:25.280
but it's more powerful if you say, you know, remember that guy Joe I told you about that

05:25.280 --> 05:29.840
we work with in Cincinnati? Yeah, it's funny you say that. He felt the exact same way. He's like,

05:29.840 --> 05:36.400
dude, I got to think about it. Feel, then felt, and then it comes to found. But what Joe found is

05:36.400 --> 05:40.320
that at the end of the day, he would rather, even though he wasn't 100% certain, he's like,

05:40.320 --> 05:44.880
I can't be 100% certain about anything. He would rather take that slight risk than me go with

05:44.880 --> 05:48.800
somebody else and work with somebody else because I've given him the free leads. He's already looking

05:48.800 --> 05:52.960
to do something different from what he's already doing. He needed to grow and it just made sense.

05:53.680 --> 05:57.280
So that's the feel felt found. And then you go in for the close again. Okay.

05:58.160 --> 06:03.200
The only other thing I would mention before you do that, I skipped a step, make sure that you

06:03.200 --> 06:08.000
make sure that that is their actual objection. Okay, you need to tie them down. Okay, Bob,

06:08.000 --> 06:12.800
I get it. So you want to think about it, right? So besides thinking about it,

06:12.800 --> 06:17.280
and I'm doing air quotes, because that's a broad thing. Besides you thinking about it.

06:17.840 --> 06:21.680
Is there any other thing, any other question, any other reason that this wouldn't make sense

06:21.680 --> 06:28.560
today? No. Okay. Now I'm going to go a little deeper. Let me ask you this, Bob. And again,

06:28.560 --> 06:32.640
I'm not going to be pushy. I just want to understand what exactly do you need to think about?

06:34.160 --> 06:38.160
Because I know that you know where your budget's at, right? You run the business,

06:38.160 --> 06:43.520
you know where the budget's at. I know that your partners are on the phone. What exactly

06:43.520 --> 06:48.080
when you say you want to think about what exactly do you mean? And they're going to tell you,

06:48.080 --> 06:51.520
right? And you're going to dig and you're going to dig and you're going to make sure and you're

06:51.520 --> 06:57.360
going to isolate that one specific issue and make sure that's the actual cause. Then you're

06:57.360 --> 07:01.040
going to use the feel felt found method. And then you're going to go back in for the close. Okay.

07:01.600 --> 07:06.560
Tie down the objection, feel felt found, go back for the close. And you don't need to be super

07:06.560 --> 07:10.480
aggressive. You could do it in your own way. You don't need to just be super blunt. I like to be

07:10.480 --> 07:15.120
that way sometimes. Sometimes I don't. It just depends on the situation, but you can do it the

07:15.120 --> 07:20.880
way that you want to do it. But again, think about it. The setup, you could have easily just

07:20.880 --> 07:25.760
told them that on the call, right? On the screencast. That would have just been simple.

07:26.640 --> 07:32.240
A line, a sentence, two sentences versus you didn't and now you're at objection

07:32.240 --> 07:35.200
overcoming and now you have to tie it down and now you have to do the feel felt found.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.240
And now you have to go back in for the close and it's a little bit uncomfortable and you're

07:38.240 --> 07:42.480
going to sweat a little bit and you're going to, it's so much easier to eliminate than it

07:42.480 --> 07:45.520
is to overcome. Sorry, that was a long answer, but that's the truth. Okay.
