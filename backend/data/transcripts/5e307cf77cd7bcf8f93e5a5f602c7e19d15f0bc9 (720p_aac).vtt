00:00.000 --> 00:10.920
Okay, guys, I don't think this guy needs an introduction, but this is Mike V, like, to

00:10.920 --> 00:14.480
be honest, I just have, I have nine questions for you, dude.

00:14.480 --> 00:21.880
And Mike V is at $40,000 a month, and he just posted his Stripe screenshot in I think it

00:21.880 --> 00:24.760
was the free group, which I really appreciated.

00:24.760 --> 00:29.880
And because I know sometimes it's scary to share, I know sometimes you think, dude, what

00:29.880 --> 00:30.880
are people going to say?

00:30.880 --> 00:33.640
What are they, you know, it's not even what they think, but what are they going to say?

00:33.640 --> 00:37.640
And if you're not the braggy type, then maybe they're going to think I'm like that.

00:37.640 --> 00:42.920
And so I do appreciate it because I think you'd be surprised how much people really

00:42.920 --> 00:47.640
get inspired by those posts, way more people get inspired than get jealous.

00:47.640 --> 00:52.180
And the people that get jealous are going to just blame the program or me or everything

00:52.180 --> 00:54.000
else and quit anyway.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
So it doesn't matter.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.520
But Mike V is at $40,000 USD per month.

00:59.520 --> 01:07.560
And I just want to ask him questions personally about how he got there, what he's doing.

01:07.560 --> 01:10.160
And like, these aren't to fill time.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.680
These are like genuine questions.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.640
So I just want to basically jump right in.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.320
Aaron, I'm going to let you ask any questions you have, I'm going to let you also, if you

01:17.320 --> 01:20.780
guys have questions, start dropping them in the comments, I'm going to have Aaron kind

01:20.780 --> 01:24.440
of moderate when there are questions that when we get to the end.

01:24.440 --> 01:28.940
So Mike V, in 42 minutes, I'm going to let you off the stream.

01:28.940 --> 01:31.120
If you can give us 42 minutes, I would appreciate that.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.440
And we're just going to get through as much as we can.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.440
Is that cool?

01:34.440 --> 01:35.440
100%.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.440
Beautiful.

01:36.440 --> 01:41.440
First and foremost, you guys need to follow Mike V on his Instagram page.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.480
He has two.

01:43.480 --> 01:46.000
And he just followed me on his like business one.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.600
He has some really amazing content ideas.

01:49.600 --> 01:53.740
And by the way, I just saw the most awesome post you made where someone is massaging your

01:53.740 --> 01:58.740
head while you were working and you had someone who touched your feet and like he based it

01:58.740 --> 02:00.420
like six.

02:00.420 --> 02:05.740
I don't even know what what nationality these girls were, but you just look like a king,

02:05.740 --> 02:06.740
dude.

02:06.740 --> 02:12.660
Yeah, it's it's one of the hacks is when you when you're printing, when you make money,

02:12.660 --> 02:16.220
you got the massage, you get a foot massage, you get someone doing your head and you're

02:16.220 --> 02:21.860
just sitting there, you know, checking strike balances, doing SEO makes for a good experience.

02:21.980 --> 02:27.100
Dude, if you're not checking SEO and eating like some type of exotic fruit, you're you're

02:27.100 --> 02:28.620
really not living, you know.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.100
For sure.

02:32.100 --> 02:34.580
That's a good time over here in Thailand for sure.

02:34.580 --> 02:38.900
But yeah, I think things have moved pretty quick this year.

02:38.900 --> 02:40.060
It's been good.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.580
What's your Instagram, bro?

02:41.580 --> 02:43.540
I want to guys, I'm serious.

02:43.540 --> 02:45.940
You guys should get inspired by what this guy is doing.

02:45.940 --> 02:50.820
And yeah, what's your Instagram, your personal or that one or whatever one?

02:51.020 --> 02:53.540
People should follow you should check out what you're doing because this guy is making

02:53.540 --> 02:55.180
moves and he's just getting started.

02:55.180 --> 02:56.580
So what is it?

02:56.580 --> 03:01.500
And then I'll have or I can even have Aaron go go to Instagram, find Mike V and just share

03:01.500 --> 03:02.180
share his link.

03:02.180 --> 03:03.980
I'll do that for you.

03:03.980 --> 03:05.140
Oh, he already did it.

03:05.140 --> 03:07.620
Marcus, we understand the chat.

03:07.620 --> 03:08.180
There you go.

03:08.180 --> 03:09.300
Beautiful.

03:09.300 --> 03:09.900
Beautiful.

03:11.460 --> 03:13.700
OK, you can drop me a photo there to see what I'm up to.

03:13.700 --> 03:18.540
And I've also got a link to my business profile and my personal one.

03:18.540 --> 03:19.860
That's OK.

03:19.860 --> 03:21.020
Awesome.

03:21.020 --> 03:25.060
So let's just let's just dive into this.

03:25.060 --> 03:28.020
We've already interviewed you before, so I'm not going to backpedal too much.

03:28.020 --> 03:32.820
But just real quick, tell us when you started and where you're living right now.

03:35.740 --> 03:37.340
When I started digital landlords.

03:37.340 --> 03:39.700
Yeah, when you started the program, I know that you had a little bit of digital

03:39.700 --> 03:41.060
marketing experience. Yeah.

03:41.060 --> 03:43.260
Just when did you start in here?

03:44.260 --> 03:49.220
I started in digital landlords about 26 months ago and I'm currently in in Thailand.

03:49.860 --> 03:56.620
Can you guys still see me?

03:58.260 --> 03:59.980
Yeah, you're back. Can you hear me?

04:01.860 --> 04:02.980
Yeah, yeah.

04:05.060 --> 04:07.060
That we cut out for a second.

04:07.060 --> 04:08.980
OK, we're good. OK, I heard 20.

04:08.980 --> 04:11.140
You said 26 months.

04:11.660 --> 04:13.620
Yeah, 26 months in digital landlords.

04:13.620 --> 04:18.060
At that time, I was back home in my corporate job and we're in Bangkok now.

04:19.060 --> 04:19.900
OK, beautiful.

04:19.900 --> 04:22.420
So that's just to give a little bit of a of a backdrop.

04:23.260 --> 04:26.220
So basically a little bit over two years.

04:26.220 --> 04:28.980
So here's the first question.

04:28.980 --> 04:30.380
Go ahead, go ahead.

04:31.620 --> 04:34.020
Yeah, two two years in digital landlords.

04:34.020 --> 04:36.580
OK. That's crazy, bro.

04:36.580 --> 04:41.940
I was in programs for four years and I was barely scratching 8000 a month.

04:41.940 --> 04:47.100
So I admire people like you, Ryan Dalton, like that.

04:47.140 --> 04:49.900
You guys are able to pick this up so quickly.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.580
I'm the type of person that just takes a long time to learn stuff.

04:52.580 --> 04:54.940
So I love it, dude.

04:54.940 --> 04:58.820
OK, so remind me, because I don't remember when we talked last time,

04:58.820 --> 05:04.260
did this did it click for you right away or did it take you some time?

05:04.260 --> 05:06.820
I know I do remember you getting to 10K relatively quickly,

05:06.820 --> 05:08.860
but like, did that very first deal?

05:08.860 --> 05:14.060
And I'm saying that for the people that just started, like, did it click quickly?

05:14.060 --> 05:16.180
And if so, why do you think that was?

05:18.100 --> 05:25.540
It clicked pretty quickly compared to what I was doing for the previous four years,

05:25.540 --> 05:28.180
because I was trying to figure out how to make money online for four years.

05:28.180 --> 05:32.540
And I was making a thousand dollars a month for four years.

05:32.540 --> 05:36.660
And then I joined the program and I just worked as hard as I could.

05:36.660 --> 05:38.820
And it clicked pretty quick.

05:38.820 --> 05:42.860
I mean, it was pretty tough up until the first deal.

05:42.860 --> 05:46.180
Just trying to believe in it and, you know, having the faith and everything.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.620
But I just, you know, read the book, the Thinking Grow Rich book.

05:49.620 --> 05:53.140
And, you know, once that first deal got over the line,

05:53.140 --> 05:55.020
it was pretty smooth sailing from there.

05:55.020 --> 05:57.860
Like you said, you just need to repeat it, you know, eight more times

05:57.860 --> 06:00.660
or 40 more times or whatever you want.

06:01.980 --> 06:06.620
Why? How long did it take you to get your first deal?

06:10.340 --> 06:13.580
I think it was four or five weeks.

06:13.580 --> 06:15.740
OK, that's maybe six.

06:15.740 --> 06:16.780
I think five.

06:16.780 --> 06:18.380
That's good.

06:18.380 --> 06:22.620
But it's not like, you know, you've got some guys like a week or two weeks.

06:22.620 --> 06:25.380
Like, that's good.

06:25.380 --> 06:27.940
But it's not like overly like that's doable.

06:27.940 --> 06:30.900
It's repeatable for anyone that gets in.

06:30.900 --> 06:31.580
Like, you know what I mean?

06:31.580 --> 06:34.700
Like anybody could come in and get a deal in five, six weeks.

06:35.060 --> 06:38.500
So that this is what I'm trying to figure out.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.180
And the reason I'm having you on, dude, is like,

06:41.180 --> 06:46.420
I'm trying to figure out why it is that some people are so successful.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.300
And why some people

06:50.300 --> 06:55.060
just want to like they it's it's it's the same material.

06:55.060 --> 06:56.780
It's the same program.

06:56.780 --> 06:58.900
It's the same coaching calls.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.500
It's the it's usually the same niches.

07:03.300 --> 07:07.300
But you're at 40K and there's people at zero that are blaming everybody else.

07:08.300 --> 07:11.900
Why do you think there's people out there that have been in for 90 days,

07:12.380 --> 07:14.340
you know, six months and have no deals?

07:18.300 --> 07:23.060
I think they might be comfortable, you know, not kind of want it bad enough.

07:23.900 --> 07:27.460
I remember when I joined, I was already going to quit my job

07:27.580 --> 07:31.140
and and leave the country and, you know, pursue my dreams.

07:31.620 --> 07:32.820
So my back was against the wall.

07:32.820 --> 07:36.180
So I don't really have a choice but to make it happen.

07:37.140 --> 07:40.660
And I knew I knew really deeply what I actually wanted,

07:40.660 --> 07:44.140
like from digital landlords, I knew that it was going to be the avenue

07:44.140 --> 07:46.260
to live the life that I have now.

07:46.260 --> 07:49.860
So I think just understanding exactly why

07:51.500 --> 07:53.260
they'll get you through like the trench phase,

07:53.260 --> 07:55.740
because there's a trench phase to every type of business model

07:55.740 --> 07:59.900
and everything you do, like whether it's learning to ride a bike, close deals.

08:00.540 --> 08:02.580
You have to get through that trench phase.

08:02.580 --> 08:03.780
And that's basically impossible

08:03.780 --> 08:06.300
unless you have like a

08:06.900 --> 08:11.900
why and perhaps like forcing yourself to do it.

08:11.940 --> 08:14.860
And if I wasn't going to quit my job, I probably wouldn't have worked as hard

08:14.860 --> 08:18.060
because I knew, you know, I've still got my my paycheck coming in.

08:18.060 --> 08:22.820
So you don't have an element of risk, I think, to go.

08:23.660 --> 08:27.020
So how do people that because I do know what you're saying.

08:27.300 --> 08:30.780
And essentially what how I interpret that is like when people are

08:31.020 --> 08:33.140
I swear comfort is the scariest thing ever.

08:33.140 --> 08:36.540
Right. Because when you're comfortable, you don't want to do

08:36.540 --> 08:38.860
you don't want to move because it's like you're just

08:38.860 --> 08:41.740
it's like being in your freaking bed and it's cold outside.

08:41.740 --> 08:45.380
Like you're just you're you're you're just content.

08:45.380 --> 08:47.940
You're just laying in those sheets and it feels so good.

08:48.300 --> 08:50.740
But you know, you're going to feel regret and you know,

08:50.740 --> 08:51.660
you're going to feel these things.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.940
But it's so hard to get out because you're comfortable.

08:54.340 --> 08:57.420
So how do you like?

08:58.020 --> 09:02.060
You know, I'm kind of like you, bro, I think, because for me,

09:02.460 --> 09:04.380
that sounds like you had already made up your mind

09:04.380 --> 09:05.220
that you're going to quit your job.

09:05.220 --> 09:06.940
You're going to go pursue your dreams.

09:06.940 --> 09:08.380
That's just what was going to happen.

09:08.380 --> 09:11.380
And so you're going to force yourself to make it happen

09:11.380 --> 09:14.460
because you're going to make yourself uncomfortable.

09:14.460 --> 09:16.860
What do other people do, bro, that aren't that type,

09:16.860 --> 09:18.620
that they're not the type that's going to go quick

09:18.620 --> 09:20.140
because I did that same kind of a thing.

09:20.140 --> 09:22.820
I just kind of quit what I was doing before.

09:23.340 --> 09:26.180
And I'm like, well, I have to figure this out.

09:26.180 --> 09:29.420
So but maybe they're not everyone's that type.

09:29.420 --> 09:31.100
That terrifies people.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.380
Do you think there's a way that people that aren't that type,

09:33.380 --> 09:38.820
that are comfortable right now in a job, in whatever,

09:38.820 --> 09:43.460
that they can force that discomfort without, like, completely just,

09:44.540 --> 09:46.540
you know, throwing caution to the wind?

09:46.540 --> 09:49.140
Yeah. You know what I mean?

09:50.020 --> 09:51.300
Yeah, for sure.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.300
I don't recommend everyone does the same approach I did,

09:53.300 --> 09:55.420
you know, especially if you've got family or something like that

09:55.420 --> 09:57.140
or other commitments.

09:57.140 --> 10:01.100
But I mean, I'm teaching a couple of people,

10:01.100 --> 10:03.740
local business, lead generation myself.

10:03.740 --> 10:05.540
Some of them are in fairly comfortable positions,

10:05.540 --> 10:08.260
like they might have other income at the moment.

10:08.260 --> 10:11.580
And I think what works for those people

10:11.580 --> 10:14.580
is kind of setting goals for yourself each week

10:14.580 --> 10:19.020
and having, like, a bit of a timeline to make your first,

10:19.020 --> 10:21.340
you know, $2,000 to $5,000.

10:21.340 --> 10:24.220
And then once you break that down into, like, weekly KPIs

10:24.220 --> 10:26.500
or things that you need to tick off,

10:26.580 --> 10:28.020
you know, at the end of the week and say,

10:28.020 --> 10:29.700
hey, did I do it or did I not do it?

10:29.700 --> 10:32.460
And I think it just comes down to discipline

10:32.460 --> 10:35.260
as well as a bit of that mindset training as well.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.980
And I'm sure you're still telling people

10:36.980 --> 10:39.260
to read that Think and Grow Rich book.

10:39.260 --> 10:40.820
So I think a combination of, yeah, your mindset

10:40.820 --> 10:44.340
and having the discipline with, like, a set goal,

10:44.340 --> 10:45.860
that's what I'd recommend

10:45.860 --> 10:48.540
instead of just throwing caution to the wind, perhaps.

10:50.740 --> 10:53.580
Okay. I'm writing notes, dude.

10:53.580 --> 10:56.500
And I'm not, again, I hope you can tell,

10:56.500 --> 10:57.700
I have all these questions,

10:57.700 --> 11:00.500
but I'm genuinely, like, having this conversation

11:00.500 --> 11:02.300
like we're just sitting there having the conversation

11:02.300 --> 11:05.700
because I would love, I'm trying to extract

11:05.700 --> 11:09.700
out of your brain how we can,

11:09.700 --> 11:12.660
and sometimes it's hard because for me,

11:14.020 --> 11:17.300
I just do it a lot of times.

11:17.300 --> 11:20.220
And so sometimes it's hard for me to relate to other people

11:20.220 --> 11:23.420
because I've always thrown caution to the wind, dude.

11:24.260 --> 11:27.740
When I got my first sales job,

11:27.740 --> 11:30.620
it was door to door, 100% commission,

11:30.620 --> 11:32.580
with a baby on the way, I was recently married,

11:32.580 --> 11:35.020
I had no money coming in and I was like, yeah, sign me up.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.860
I can make, what's the potential?

11:36.860 --> 11:37.740
What's the best guy?

11:37.740 --> 11:39.220
What was the best guy in the company last year?

11:39.220 --> 11:40.060
They said 90 grand.

11:40.060 --> 11:40.940
Okay, awesome.

11:40.940 --> 11:44.660
So that's the, I can make at least 90 grand.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.540
Okay, sign me up.

11:45.540 --> 11:47.300
I know I'm as good as that guy.

11:47.300 --> 11:48.220
And that's just how I think.

11:48.220 --> 11:50.500
And I quit my job and we moved across the country

11:50.500 --> 11:51.540
and I made it work.

11:51.540 --> 11:54.020
When I started this business, I bought a program

11:54.020 --> 11:57.060
and I stopped doing that job to do this.

11:57.060 --> 12:00.860
And I just, sometimes I find it hard to relate

12:00.860 --> 12:02.980
and I don't know how to tell people

12:04.220 --> 12:07.740
to make themselves uncomfortable because they just,

12:07.740 --> 12:10.140
they're just gonna die in their discomfort, I feel like.

12:10.140 --> 12:11.540
Aaron, do you have anything you wanna add on this?

12:11.540 --> 12:14.780
Because Aaron is, dude,

12:14.780 --> 12:16.940
this is one of the sharpest kids I've ever met.

12:16.940 --> 12:18.300
Very persistent, by the way.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.260
One of these days we're gonna go live

12:19.260 --> 12:20.260
on how persistent this guy is.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.220
Aaron, anything you wanna add on this?

12:24.220 --> 12:27.100
No, I mean, I think you're right on, Mike.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.340
It seems like we always do the thing we desire most

12:29.340 --> 12:31.740
in the moment and just we live life

12:31.740 --> 12:33.340
generally choosing comfort.

12:36.260 --> 12:37.100
Yeah.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.580
Yeah, yeah.

12:38.580 --> 12:40.100
And- Yeah, for sure.

12:40.100 --> 12:44.980
And we trade temporary comfort for future regret,

12:46.260 --> 12:47.260
which is scary.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.300
I don't know.

12:49.300 --> 12:50.620
I think I'd add on that,

12:50.620 --> 12:54.340
just thinking about how to put early,

12:54.340 --> 12:55.660
putting yourself in financial stress

12:55.660 --> 12:57.580
or family stress or whatever is,

12:59.500 --> 13:01.140
just having a true understanding

13:01.140 --> 13:02.300
of the shortness of life.

13:02.300 --> 13:05.500
And I was reading a lot of stock philosophy

13:05.500 --> 13:08.860
leading up to joining the group

13:08.860 --> 13:11.620
and also going home with the travel side

13:11.620 --> 13:14.620
and actually kind of meditating on that a bit

13:14.620 --> 13:17.300
and just pondering the short life

13:17.300 --> 13:22.300
can motivate you in a way of, for me is like,

13:22.820 --> 13:24.740
there's so much to explore in this world.

13:24.740 --> 13:26.060
There's so many places to travel to.

13:26.060 --> 13:28.220
There's so much to experience.

13:28.220 --> 13:29.660
And you can't really appreciate that

13:29.660 --> 13:31.460
until you kind of understand that,

13:31.460 --> 13:33.820
hey, we only really have 80 years here.

13:33.820 --> 13:36.380
So that's another way to kind of motivate yourself

13:36.380 --> 13:37.220
to work harder.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.140
Yeah.

13:41.140 --> 13:42.260
This is a personal question.

13:42.260 --> 13:44.460
You said you would already made up your mind

13:44.460 --> 13:47.860
to quit your job and chase your dreams, right?

13:49.340 --> 13:50.180
Yeah.

13:50.180 --> 13:52.060
What are your dreams?

13:52.060 --> 13:54.340
What is it that you,

13:54.340 --> 13:58.020
because I think people are either motivated

13:58.020 --> 14:01.460
by they're running away from something they're scared of

14:01.460 --> 14:04.420
or they're running towards something that they want.

14:04.420 --> 14:07.180
What are your dreams that you wanted to quit your job

14:07.180 --> 14:09.060
and use this to achieve?

14:12.500 --> 14:13.660
I think you should do it now,

14:13.700 --> 14:17.820
but training Muay Thai, waking up whenever I want.

14:17.820 --> 14:19.780
I ride my scooter through the mountains

14:19.780 --> 14:21.460
to the beach every day.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.780
Got a pool villa with a nice blue pool in it.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.660
I'm hanging out with other guys doing the same thing.

14:27.660 --> 14:29.660
Now I don't have to go to my corporate office

14:29.660 --> 14:31.980
and like sacrifice my authenticity.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.580
You know, I don't have to live in anyone else's shadow

14:34.580 --> 14:36.860
and do stuff that's inauthentic,

14:36.860 --> 14:40.380
which I think can just impact the quality of your life.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.780
When you have to go to a job that you don't like

14:41.780 --> 14:45.500
and supplicate to a boss, like it chips away your soul.

14:45.500 --> 14:49.780
And I'm living my dreams now, so I'm happy as.

14:49.780 --> 14:50.620
That's sick, dude.

14:50.620 --> 14:53.660
So you're living in Thailand.

14:53.660 --> 14:57.660
You basically every day you wake up when you want

14:57.660 --> 15:00.500
and then you, how many times a week are you going

15:00.500 --> 15:02.900
to the beach through the mountains on a scooter?

15:04.860 --> 15:07.820
Every day I drive into Starbucks,

15:07.820 --> 15:09.300
get a coffee, hang out with some friends

15:09.300 --> 15:11.940
and I still work extremely hard.

15:11.940 --> 15:14.500
I think last month I worked 30 days straight,

15:14.500 --> 15:18.060
just because I was so excited about the business

15:18.060 --> 15:20.060
and I had a lot of momentum going.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.260
That's crazy, bro.

15:22.260 --> 15:24.540
I love stories like that.

15:24.540 --> 15:28.420
Stories like yours, they are inspiring

15:28.420 --> 15:31.460
because it's like you are literally,

15:31.460 --> 15:32.980
it's like you're like literally living

15:32.980 --> 15:37.140
the Tim Ferriss 40 hour work week,

15:37.140 --> 15:39.180
not necessarily that's how much you work,

15:40.060 --> 15:43.260
but like just the, you're doing, is it called Muay Thai?

15:44.940 --> 15:46.420
Yeah, Muay Thai, yeah.

15:47.420 --> 15:48.260
I love it, bro.

15:48.260 --> 15:50.060
Had my first fight recently, which was fun.

15:50.060 --> 15:52.180
Yeah, tell us about that.

15:52.180 --> 15:53.340
How did you do, bro?

15:55.140 --> 15:57.940
Yeah, good, it was, I mean, I've always done Muay Thai,

15:57.940 --> 15:59.220
I've always liked combat sports

15:59.220 --> 16:01.580
and I was like, hey, I've got free time now.

16:01.580 --> 16:05.380
Like, yeah, so I signed up for a fight, super nervous,

16:05.380 --> 16:08.140
but I was like, hey, let's, you know, the fight's signed,

16:08.140 --> 16:10.660
we've got to train hard now, we've got to prepare for war

16:10.660 --> 16:13.060
and, you know, because I had digital landlords,

16:13.060 --> 16:14.620
I had all my money coming in,

16:14.620 --> 16:16.300
I was able to train twice a day,

16:16.300 --> 16:17.860
I was working like an hour or two,

16:17.860 --> 16:20.300
just keeping the lights on and had the fight,

16:20.300 --> 16:23.500
went well, no injuries and got the win.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.740
So that was an awesome moment this year as well.

16:26.740 --> 16:29.820
That's crazy, I love that, dude.

16:31.100 --> 16:33.820
Yeah, there was a student that we had on,

16:33.820 --> 16:36.860
his name is, I think it's Jordan,

16:36.900 --> 16:40.100
and I remember something that he said,

16:40.100 --> 16:41.420
we were talking about, he was talking about

16:41.420 --> 16:45.100
some of the stuff he wants to do with his son and stuff

16:45.100 --> 16:46.460
and he was talking about this mountain

16:46.460 --> 16:47.300
that he wants to climb

16:47.300 --> 16:48.700
and he said something that always stuck with me,

16:48.700 --> 16:52.740
he's like, imagine like living your whole life

16:52.740 --> 16:55.180
and not having, not climbing that mountain

16:55.180 --> 16:57.060
and he named this specific mountain

16:57.060 --> 16:58.380
and I can't remember what mountain it was,

16:58.380 --> 17:01.500
but like that was an important mountain for him.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.460
And it's just insane that like,

17:03.460 --> 17:05.300
there's so many things to do,

17:05.300 --> 17:07.060
so many places to see,

17:07.060 --> 17:09.340
so many like problems to solve,

17:09.340 --> 17:12.500
people to meet, experiences to have,

17:12.500 --> 17:15.300
foods to taste, cultures to experience

17:15.300 --> 17:17.260
and all it is is on the other side

17:17.260 --> 17:21.740
of like just doing the freaking boring work

17:21.740 --> 17:23.660
of what we have in front of us.

17:23.660 --> 17:26.300
It's, I mean, you're an example of it, bro.

17:26.300 --> 17:31.300
What like, what was your life like 27 months ago?

17:31.300 --> 17:34.300
The trenches, I was working 40 hours a week.

17:34.300 --> 17:38.420
I was working two hours after work on the business,

17:38.420 --> 17:42.620
on the side business, on the hobby, you know, at the time.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.820
I was training an hour a day in the gym,

17:44.820 --> 17:48.260
so I was flat out, I only had Sundays off just to recover

17:48.260 --> 17:50.540
and then we'd be straight back in the trenches

17:50.540 --> 17:52.580
and like those are the points I look back on

17:52.580 --> 17:56.580
and kind of like revere and like whole daily,

17:56.580 --> 17:57.700
like sitting at the desk,

17:57.700 --> 17:59.580
like looking out the window and like,

17:59.700 --> 18:02.340
sitting at the desk and looking out the window,

18:02.340 --> 18:07.340
just like dreaming of just an absolute trenches

18:08.260 --> 18:10.780
but like enjoying it, like, you know,

18:10.780 --> 18:12.940
knowing that it was gonna work out

18:12.940 --> 18:15.140
because all of the work that,

18:15.140 --> 18:18.460
all of the mindset stuff and think and grow rich,

18:18.460 --> 18:20.180
that's such a massive part of it.

18:20.180 --> 18:21.940
And especially it is hard at the start

18:21.940 --> 18:23.140
when you don't have that mindset

18:23.140 --> 18:26.420
or you don't have other people around you who are doing it.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.020
But I think just listen to your advice

18:29.020 --> 18:31.980
and jumping on the live calls and just like embracing it.

18:33.740 --> 18:35.100
Look at there in the end.

18:36.940 --> 18:40.100
I think going back to what we talked about

18:40.100 --> 18:41.420
with like discomfort,

18:43.020 --> 18:46.340
you know, one way I've found to make yourself uncomfortable

18:46.340 --> 18:51.340
is purposely putting yourself around people

18:55.540 --> 18:58.460
that are playing at such a higher level than you.

18:59.580 --> 19:01.820
That you will feel uncomfortable

19:01.820 --> 19:06.820
because you know, you're gonna see that like

19:06.940 --> 19:11.940
for them to go and buy a brand new Range Rover

19:12.220 --> 19:16.860
or a brand new G wagon tomorrow cash is an afterthought

19:16.860 --> 19:21.860
or to book a charter, a jet to go down to Mexico

19:23.140 --> 19:27.780
for three days and spend 20 grand is just something

19:27.780 --> 19:30.940
that you decide to do over a drink one night.

19:30.940 --> 19:32.100
And you're like, oh my gosh,

19:32.100 --> 19:34.700
if I'm gonna keep being friends with these people,

19:34.700 --> 19:36.860
I gotta start being like playing a different game

19:36.860 --> 19:38.220
because if I get invited to these things,

19:38.220 --> 19:39.740
I can't be the guy that's like,

19:39.740 --> 19:42.100
dude, what's the price of the jet?

19:42.100 --> 19:42.940
You know what I mean?

19:42.940 --> 19:46.340
So I think one thing that we can do

19:46.340 --> 19:51.340
to force that discomfort is get around people

19:51.660 --> 19:55.140
at a higher level of very, a much higher level than us.

19:55.140 --> 19:58.620
And it makes us, it kind of makes us realize

19:58.620 --> 20:01.620
just how small we're playing compared to other people.

20:01.620 --> 20:03.020
Do you know what I'm saying?

20:04.540 --> 20:05.940
Yeah, a hundred percent.

20:05.940 --> 20:09.420
I mean, eight to 10 weeks after joining your landlords,

20:09.420 --> 20:11.060
I was on around 10K a month.

20:12.740 --> 20:15.540
And I was cruising on about 10K a month for about a year,

20:15.540 --> 20:17.340
like traveling around a bit.

20:17.340 --> 20:19.900
And it got pretty lonely just traveling by yourself.

20:19.900 --> 20:22.340
So I joined like a bit of a network

20:22.420 --> 20:24.500
of like other entrepreneurs.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.100
And like Nick says, like a lot of them

20:26.100 --> 20:27.860
were making some great money,

20:27.860 --> 20:30.020
like much more than myself.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.020
And just being around them,

20:32.020 --> 20:33.940
like pulling you up to a higher level,

20:33.940 --> 20:36.020
or like you're absorbing the mindsets that they have,

20:36.020 --> 20:38.540
like you're thinking about what they're doing.

20:38.540 --> 20:39.860
And that was actually a key part

20:39.860 --> 20:41.500
because at the start of this year

20:41.500 --> 20:43.620
is when I joined that group,

20:43.620 --> 20:46.060
when I was on 10K and then fast forward,

20:46.060 --> 20:48.420
nine months later, we're on 40,000.

20:49.260 --> 20:52.340
So I attribute most of this year's success

20:52.340 --> 20:56.100
to almost all of it, to that group of people.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.860
And even the converse, and I agree, bro.

20:59.860 --> 21:01.300
And even the conversations,

21:01.300 --> 21:03.060
the way that they talk about things,

21:03.060 --> 21:08.060
like I've recently kind of like formed this relationship

21:08.220 --> 21:13.220
with this guy and it's like, just the,

21:13.220 --> 21:18.220
it's like casually like, oh, I'm gonna buy a house.

21:21.500 --> 21:24.900
This guy in Dubai, you know, I think I'm gonna,

21:25.940 --> 21:27.700
he has, I don't know,

21:27.700 --> 21:30.980
I think it's like 14 places here in Dubai.

21:30.980 --> 21:33.860
And he just wanted to buy a villa.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.020
And he wanted to buy a villa.

21:35.020 --> 21:36.620
And there wasn't a budget.

21:36.620 --> 21:39.660
It was just what's the villa that we want.

21:39.660 --> 21:43.500
And I started like to dig in a little bit.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.940
And it was like, and he ended up getting one.

21:45.940 --> 21:49.740
And it was like, it was like 6 million or 7 million.

21:49.740 --> 21:53.100
It was just cash, no loan, no nothing.

21:53.100 --> 21:56.540
And you're like, okay, that's cool, man.

21:56.540 --> 22:00.540
I like, it's just, it's the game is levels.

22:00.540 --> 22:02.260
And you just start going, oh my gosh,

22:02.260 --> 22:03.860
this guy's so much more,

22:03.860 --> 22:06.260
he's doing so much more than me financially.

22:06.260 --> 22:07.100
I gotta keep up.

22:07.100 --> 22:09.140
So anyway, for those of you that are sitting there

22:09.140 --> 22:11.980
going, I feel comfortable.

22:11.980 --> 22:14.020
And I don't know what to do

22:14.020 --> 22:17.380
because I'm making $15,000 a month.

22:17.380 --> 22:22.380
Guys, that is a lot compared to, you know,

22:22.740 --> 22:26.020
your brother that works at Starbucks.

22:26.020 --> 22:26.940
That's great.

22:26.940 --> 22:29.100
But like 15,000 a month,

22:30.860 --> 22:33.020
I don't know how people live on 15,000 a month

22:33.020 --> 22:35.220
that have a family.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.380
And I don't mean that being at all condescending.

22:37.380 --> 22:40.540
I'm genuinely saying like when you look at gas

22:40.540 --> 22:43.740
and if you have a pool and you're paying to heat the pool

22:43.740 --> 22:46.620
and the pool guy and the vacation,

22:46.620 --> 22:48.260
I mean, dude, you can't live on 15.

22:48.260 --> 22:49.620
I don't know how you live on 15 grand.

22:49.620 --> 22:52.100
And I know people that are living on like four grand.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.660
So those of you that are uncomfortable,

22:54.660 --> 22:56.300
one thing that you could try

22:56.300 --> 22:58.900
is getting around other people

22:58.900 --> 23:01.500
than your same friends that you go and, you know,

23:01.500 --> 23:05.140
do, you know, whatever drink on,

23:05.140 --> 23:06.820
at the bowling alley on a Wednesday, whatever.

23:06.820 --> 23:10.460
So, okay, two more questions for me,

23:10.460 --> 23:12.260
three more questions.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.420
And then I wanna go to Q&A.

23:14.420 --> 23:15.860
Mike, these are just random.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.620
And I wanna know this because I swear to you,

23:17.620 --> 23:18.460
I'm trying to like,

23:18.460 --> 23:20.620
I'm asking everybody these questions.

23:20.620 --> 23:23.460
And so they're really kind of out there,

23:23.460 --> 23:24.860
but I'm just, I'm curious.

23:25.740 --> 23:27.020
And there's no wrong answer.

23:27.020 --> 23:28.060
There's no right answer.

23:28.060 --> 23:30.820
But it just, I'm gonna keep asking these questions

23:30.820 --> 23:32.300
because I'm trying to find commonalities.

23:32.300 --> 23:37.300
But are you a spiritual and or religious person

23:39.220 --> 23:42.020
or would you consider yourself neither of those things?

23:44.540 --> 23:45.500
Yeah, definitely.

23:47.340 --> 23:49.300
And open to religion.

23:49.300 --> 23:51.620
I think agnostic's the word.

23:51.620 --> 23:53.620
Definitely believe in some sort of high purpose

23:53.620 --> 23:55.620
or something, you know,

23:55.620 --> 23:58.700
that we can't quite perceive in the third dimension,

23:58.700 --> 23:59.700
whatever that means.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.820
Okay, I just, I'm completely just curious.

24:03.820 --> 24:08.420
Yeah, there's no, it's just, I'm observing,

24:08.420 --> 24:11.140
I'm looking at other things because, you know,

24:11.140 --> 24:12.660
you see things, you're like, oh yeah,

24:12.660 --> 24:14.180
all the people I know that are successful,

24:14.180 --> 24:16.460
they do these, but these are things that are like,

24:16.460 --> 24:17.340
I'm just curious.

24:17.340 --> 24:19.020
Other thing I'm curious about is,

24:21.020 --> 24:26.020
do you, are you actively involved with your time

24:26.020 --> 24:30.580
or money in any kind of like a charity at this point,

24:30.580 --> 24:32.980
or is it something that you plan on doing in the future

24:32.980 --> 24:34.820
or is it just like not something on your radar

24:34.820 --> 24:36.020
that doesn't make you a good or bad person?

24:36.020 --> 24:36.940
I'm just curious.

24:39.940 --> 24:40.940
I don't have any charities,

24:40.940 --> 24:45.020
but I always tip like very, very heavily.

24:45.020 --> 24:46.540
Excuse me.

24:46.540 --> 24:47.940
You know, especially at the villa,

24:47.940 --> 24:49.340
like you've got people cleaning the pool,

24:49.340 --> 24:51.260
people are coming through like plan maintenance,

24:51.260 --> 24:52.340
people come clean and like,

24:52.340 --> 24:55.100
I always tip like, you know, a really good amount.

24:55.100 --> 24:55.940
That's cool.

24:55.940 --> 24:57.580
And that's not only to kind of give back to people

24:57.580 --> 24:58.500
with less opportunity,

24:58.500 --> 25:01.460
but also just building like an abundance mindset

25:01.460 --> 25:02.940
when it comes to money.

25:02.940 --> 25:04.580
And it's funny how it works

25:04.580 --> 25:08.020
is when you start tipping more and like giving more,

25:08.020 --> 25:10.460
you know, deals just landed on your lap,

25:10.460 --> 25:12.100
money is just comes to you.

25:12.100 --> 25:16.100
And yeah, I think that's a charity

25:16.100 --> 25:18.060
in whatever sense it is, it's really good.

25:18.060 --> 25:20.540
You can't be stingy or you can't be scarce with money

25:20.620 --> 25:25.060
because you maintain that reality if it is in your mind.

25:26.140 --> 25:27.900
You know, it's funny.

25:27.900 --> 25:30.420
You guys, I don't know, maybe you do, maybe you don't,

25:30.420 --> 25:32.180
but the guy that does all of our YouTube videos,

25:32.180 --> 25:34.380
he's also a student inside here named Isaac.

25:36.100 --> 25:39.980
He's 21, 22, I think, maybe he's 22, maybe he's 23.

25:39.980 --> 25:41.180
I don't know, he's young.

25:41.180 --> 25:43.420
He taught me something and it pisses me off

25:43.420 --> 25:45.100
that I had to learn this from him

25:45.100 --> 25:47.100
because I always just, I kind of treat him

25:47.100 --> 25:50.060
like little brother, you know, I would kind of rough him up.

25:50.060 --> 25:53.660
But this one day we went to this gym,

25:53.660 --> 25:58.060
we were down in California and we went to this gym,

25:58.060 --> 25:59.580
like we did like a late gym session

25:59.580 --> 26:02.020
because we went to Disneyland and he'd never been

26:02.020 --> 26:03.740
and my family went and I invited him,

26:03.740 --> 26:05.420
went to Disneyland and me and him decided

26:05.420 --> 26:06.820
to go to the gym at like 11.

26:07.820 --> 26:11.580
And he went and bought like a energy drink before the gym

26:11.580 --> 26:13.780
because we were so tired, he bought like a whatever.

26:13.780 --> 26:16.660
And you know, when you buy something

26:16.700 --> 26:20.900
or you go to a restaurant, asks for a tip, right?

26:20.900 --> 26:24.860
He tipped more than the drink.

26:24.860 --> 26:27.620
It was like a $4 drink and he tipped or the same.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.820
It's like five bucks, he tipped five.

26:29.820 --> 26:32.140
And dude, he came over and he was like,

26:32.140 --> 26:33.180
he told me about it, he's like,

26:33.180 --> 26:34.860
you should have seen how happy this guy was.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.780
He was like, thank you so much, bro.

26:36.780 --> 26:38.260
And this kid, I'm like, what?

26:38.260 --> 26:41.300
Why would you tip the, he didn't do anything for you, bro.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.700
Why would you tip on that?

26:42.700 --> 26:44.420
Because I always used to get pissed

26:44.420 --> 26:46.660
when it would be like, you know, do you tip?

26:46.660 --> 26:48.540
And he taught me that he's like,

26:48.540 --> 26:51.420
dude, I always choose the most.

26:51.420 --> 26:54.340
And I'm like, you're stupid, dude.

26:54.340 --> 26:57.100
And I was like, all right, I'm gonna try to do that.

26:57.100 --> 27:01.260
And I swear to you for a long time, I've been doing this.

27:01.260 --> 27:04.740
If I'm on my DoorDash or like in Dubai,

27:04.740 --> 27:07.700
it's called Deliveroo or if I'm at a restaurant,

27:07.700 --> 27:09.980
I always choose the highest amount.

27:10.020 --> 27:12.980
Like if it's like five, seven or 20,

27:12.980 --> 27:15.700
I choose 20 every time.

27:15.700 --> 27:18.860
And I swear sometimes I hesitate cause I'm like,

27:18.860 --> 27:21.940
oh, that's like, especially if it's like $500 bill,

27:21.940 --> 27:26.060
you're like, I just spent an extra whatever, 100 bucks.

27:26.060 --> 27:28.980
I swear to you, there's something about it though,

27:28.980 --> 27:31.700
that if you are, you know, abundant,

27:31.700 --> 27:33.300
then abundance flows to you.

27:33.300 --> 27:34.140
It's crazy.

27:34.140 --> 27:36.220
It's, I don't know.

27:36.220 --> 27:39.020
I don't know how to explain it.

27:39.020 --> 27:42.500
It's like when you go to his tech to the 20 bucks,

27:42.500 --> 27:46.500
for example, like when you go through with it,

27:46.500 --> 27:48.500
it's, you're basically telling yourself,

27:48.500 --> 27:51.900
I know I'm implausible because I know more money's coming.

27:51.900 --> 27:54.020
And that's, that changes the whole way you operate.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.500
When you're on sales call, it's like you're more relaxed.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.940
When you're doing your due diligence,

27:57.940 --> 27:59.580
you're more motivated.

27:59.580 --> 28:00.740
And just touching with the DoorDash,

28:00.740 --> 28:03.820
on the DoorDash, we have Grab here in Thailand.

28:03.820 --> 28:05.940
And this dude rocked up a couple of days ago,

28:05.940 --> 28:07.380
delivering the morning coffee.

28:08.380 --> 28:10.420
He's like freshly broke his hand.

28:11.300 --> 28:12.580
You know, and he's driving his bike.

28:12.580 --> 28:14.340
He gets off his bike and he hands me the coffee.

28:14.340 --> 28:18.740
And I'm like, whoa, this is a poor fellow right here.

28:18.740 --> 28:22.340
And he's still in the trenches, you know, grinding.

28:22.340 --> 28:25.300
And then he came back another week later.

28:25.300 --> 28:28.620
I tipped him 20 bucks, like the max I could in the app.

28:28.620 --> 28:29.820
Then he came back the next week

28:29.820 --> 28:32.180
and he showed me his doctor's certificate.

28:32.180 --> 28:33.020
And I was like, man,

28:33.020 --> 28:34.300
there's some really unfortunate people,

28:34.300 --> 28:36.300
but this guy's still out here, like, you know,

28:36.340 --> 28:38.100
putting food on his family's table.

28:41.500 --> 28:45.180
It's in the way that, yeah, anyway, it's so true, bro.

28:45.180 --> 28:46.700
So anyway, you guys don't have to do that.

28:46.700 --> 28:48.540
But for me, I found that it's like a big thing.

28:48.540 --> 28:52.180
So kind of out there a bit, but it's true.

28:52.180 --> 28:55.540
So, okay, dude, let's get into some Q&A.

28:55.540 --> 28:56.820
I'm gonna ask this last question

28:56.820 --> 28:59.260
and I'm gonna have Aaron kind of like,

28:59.260 --> 29:04.260
be the person that kind of coordinates all the Q&A,

29:04.500 --> 29:05.860
so I don't have to look at it.

29:07.020 --> 29:09.020
But the question that I'm having coming into this,

29:09.020 --> 29:10.420
and I'm just gonna ask it to you

29:10.420 --> 29:12.900
because it's the question I'm trying to like,

29:12.900 --> 29:15.100
think of the, I'm thinking about this the entire time

29:15.100 --> 29:17.140
and this is why I wanted you on this call.

29:18.140 --> 29:23.140
But like, how can we help students in this program

29:23.740 --> 29:27.900
inside of this group replicate your success?

29:32.180 --> 29:35.060
Is it something that we can do,

29:35.060 --> 29:39.100
like my team, me, Aaron, Ashley, Isaac,

29:39.100 --> 29:40.500
and I'm sure it's a combination of both,

29:40.500 --> 29:42.100
and if so, what?

29:42.100 --> 29:45.780
Is it on the students, like how,

29:45.780 --> 29:48.940
dude, what can we, I wish I just knew the answer

29:48.940 --> 29:51.460
and we could do that thing.

29:51.460 --> 29:54.460
I'm trying to extract like how in the world

29:54.460 --> 29:59.460
do we get people to have even a quarter of your success

29:59.540 --> 30:02.140
to just go and do it because there's no reason,

30:02.140 --> 30:07.140
if Mike's at 40,000 in two years per month, US,

30:07.980 --> 30:10.220
why do you guys, why do some of you not have a deal?

30:10.220 --> 30:13.180
I don't get it, I don't get it.

30:13.180 --> 30:16.260
So Mike, how do we replicate your success, dude?

30:17.860 --> 30:21.140
Yeah, I think everything's, I think everything's there,

30:21.140 --> 30:24.660
like, you know, I did a bit of marketing before I joined

30:24.660 --> 30:26.220
and I was going through the course

30:26.220 --> 30:27.420
with like a beginner's mindset

30:27.420 --> 30:30.900
and just following everything exactly as training suggested

30:30.900 --> 30:33.100
and I think the training's perfect.

30:33.100 --> 30:34.660
You know, you follow it enough times,

30:34.660 --> 30:35.820
you're gonna get deals.

30:38.060 --> 30:39.500
I think a big part of the training

30:39.500 --> 30:43.700
that maybe people neglect in place of the technical stuff

30:43.700 --> 30:47.140
like the SCR and due diligence is just the mindset side,

30:47.140 --> 30:49.900
the think and grow rich book that you recommended

30:49.900 --> 30:51.620
and some of the goal setting, you know,

30:51.620 --> 30:54.020
like how many cold calls are you gonna have to do

30:54.020 --> 30:56.660
to hit your $5,000 a month target

30:56.660 --> 30:58.620
or whatever your target is?

30:58.620 --> 30:59.820
And if you don't have your target,

30:59.860 --> 31:02.260
then you need to set a target.

31:02.260 --> 31:06.660
And when you mentioned Tim Ferriss's for our work week,

31:06.660 --> 31:09.740
the first chapter of that is D for definition,

31:09.740 --> 31:12.540
which is to actually define your ideal life

31:12.540 --> 31:14.820
and you might be surprised at how many deals you need.

31:14.820 --> 31:16.820
You only need, you may only need two,

31:16.820 --> 31:18.220
I only need one or two deals

31:18.220 --> 31:20.260
to live my dream life at the start

31:20.260 --> 31:23.580
because that was the price of three meals, a scooter,

31:23.580 --> 31:27.620
you know, a cheap villa in Thailand.

31:27.620 --> 31:30.700
So that's what I would suggest.

31:30.700 --> 31:31.540
I love that.

31:32.580 --> 31:34.940
And just so everybody knows,

31:34.940 --> 31:38.380
we know that we can make improvements

31:38.380 --> 31:40.620
and Aaron kind of alluded to that at the beginning.

31:40.620 --> 31:42.860
There are some massive, we're gonna be,

31:42.860 --> 31:46.900
by the way, we are in the planning stages of redoing

31:46.900 --> 31:49.180
to version 3.0, the training.

31:49.180 --> 31:52.100
And without giving too much away,

31:52.100 --> 31:54.420
we have some really, really interesting stuff.

31:54.420 --> 31:57.180
So just know that we know that like we can improve.

31:57.180 --> 32:01.660
It's not like there's not things that we can do better.

32:01.660 --> 32:03.500
The fact of the matter is though,

32:03.500 --> 32:05.140
that with the exact same training

32:05.140 --> 32:07.180
that is currently available,

32:07.180 --> 32:10.660
Mike has managed to get to $40,000 USD per month

32:10.660 --> 32:14.460
while also fighting and training for a fight,

32:14.460 --> 32:18.700
while also riding his scooter to the beach every day,

32:18.700 --> 32:22.420
while also getting head massages

32:22.420 --> 32:24.140
while he's checking his stride.

32:25.100 --> 32:27.860
Let's not forget about that.

32:27.860 --> 32:30.660
So anyway, bro.

32:30.660 --> 32:31.500
Dude, it's been-

32:31.500 --> 32:32.580
Send the picture for the group.

32:32.580 --> 32:33.900
Yeah, send that picture.

32:33.900 --> 32:35.340
You should post that picture, by the way.

32:35.340 --> 32:36.620
That's an epic.

32:36.620 --> 32:38.220
I saw that on your story and I was like,

32:38.220 --> 32:39.540
I love that story.

32:39.540 --> 32:41.260
That's a really good story you posted.

32:41.260 --> 32:45.060
So I wanna get into a little bit of Q&A,

32:45.060 --> 32:48.100
but I do just wanna first before we go in the last 10 minutes,

32:48.100 --> 32:49.140
just thank you for coming on

32:49.140 --> 32:50.980
because I know your time is super valuable.

32:51.140 --> 32:54.860
$40,000 per month, guys, his time is worth a lot.

32:54.860 --> 32:58.140
And so I hope you guys listen to what he's saying.

32:58.140 --> 33:00.900
And I've heard you say a couple of things.

33:00.900 --> 33:02.340
You've repeated a couple of things,

33:02.340 --> 33:04.500
which I've made a note of here.

33:04.500 --> 33:09.500
And you've inspired me to go and reread Think and Grow Rich

33:09.540 --> 33:11.860
for the third or fourth time,

33:11.860 --> 33:14.700
even though I was probably the one that tried to get you

33:14.700 --> 33:16.300
to do it in the beginning when you watched the training.

33:16.300 --> 33:18.140
But you've mentioned that a couple of times,

33:18.140 --> 33:19.740
which has got me thinking, you know what?

33:19.740 --> 33:22.020
I really should dig back into that.

33:22.020 --> 33:23.460
What a powerful book.

33:24.700 --> 33:28.500
So I hope you guys are listening to Mike.

33:28.500 --> 33:31.340
He is somebody, if you guys are not at $40,000,

33:31.340 --> 33:33.140
you should be thinking, what is this guy doing

33:33.140 --> 33:34.220
that I'm not doing?

33:34.220 --> 33:37.140
Or what is he, as Hermosy always talks about,

33:37.140 --> 33:40.700
what is he not doing that I am doing?

33:40.700 --> 33:42.100
And go do that.

33:42.100 --> 33:43.940
It's extremely simple.

33:46.060 --> 33:48.380
Yeah, that's a huge part of getting from the 10 to the 40

33:49.260 --> 33:51.140
and beyond is, what are you not doing?

33:52.820 --> 33:55.540
Like you say, in the YouTube videos,

33:55.540 --> 33:59.020
it's simplification, just focusing on ranking rent only.

33:59.020 --> 34:02.260
Say no to everything else at the right time.

34:02.260 --> 34:04.940
And focusing on the one thing is how you're gonna really

34:04.940 --> 34:05.900
scale this business.

34:05.900 --> 34:09.140
And to be honest, like today I worked a couple of hours.

34:09.140 --> 34:12.140
I've got 38 active retainers.

34:12.140 --> 34:14.180
And I literally got not much to do.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.140
It's all systematized.

34:16.140 --> 34:18.180
That's because I'm focusing on one thing.

34:19.180 --> 34:20.340
Beautiful, bro.

34:20.340 --> 34:21.380
It's beautiful.

34:21.380 --> 34:23.020
Get good at one thing.

34:23.020 --> 34:25.460
Get good at doing a thousand dollar a month

34:25.460 --> 34:28.380
flat fee Legion deal in four or five niches

34:28.380 --> 34:30.780
and doing it again and again and again and again and again.

34:30.780 --> 34:33.060
And you're gonna get rich.

34:33.060 --> 34:33.900
That's it.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.900
So Aaron, let's bust a couple of questions for Mike

34:35.900 --> 34:37.260
if there's any in the chat.

34:38.500 --> 34:39.620
Yeah, we got some good ones.

34:39.620 --> 34:42.820
So Daniel said, Mike, if you had to restart,

34:42.820 --> 34:45.660
how fast would you get back to 40K?

34:45.660 --> 34:47.780
So assuming like knowing now what you know,

34:48.060 --> 34:50.180
like how fast you think you could scale or?

34:52.500 --> 34:55.620
At the moment, I've probably got about five active deals

34:55.620 --> 34:58.580
in my pipeline, my hair table.

34:59.820 --> 35:03.300
So I'm probably closing a new retainer every week.

35:03.300 --> 35:06.500
So about 40 weeks, I'd get back to 40K.

35:08.380 --> 35:09.900
Yeah, that's awesome.

35:09.900 --> 35:13.980
And I would probably add that Mike would probably do that

35:13.980 --> 35:16.060
while maintaining the exact same lifestyle

35:16.060 --> 35:17.260
that he's got right now.

35:18.660 --> 35:20.460
I'm seeing everything systematized.

35:20.460 --> 35:22.620
If you're only around 10K and you're looking to get to 40K,

35:22.620 --> 35:23.940
I definitely recommend a good book.

35:23.940 --> 35:25.900
It's called Systemology.

35:26.900 --> 35:29.380
I've never really been like a super organized guy,

35:31.020 --> 35:34.500
but Systemology has made systematizing the business

35:34.500 --> 35:36.860
like extremely easy.

35:36.860 --> 35:38.260
I recommend that to everyone.

35:39.740 --> 35:41.140
Beautiful, I'm gonna write that down.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.980
Awesome, I'll put that, cool, I'll put that in the chat.

35:43.980 --> 35:46.340
Yeah, and then Kirk Clark says,

35:46.460 --> 35:48.900
and then Kirk Clark says, where are your customers?

35:48.900 --> 35:51.660
Is it U.S. or is it Australia?

35:53.500 --> 35:55.260
Yeah, so all my customers,

35:55.260 --> 35:56.820
pretty much all my clients are in New Zealand.

35:56.820 --> 35:59.020
I've got two in Australia,

35:59.020 --> 36:01.660
and the time difference is about five hours.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.220
So I still wake up at 10 a.m. my time,

36:04.220 --> 36:05.860
which is like five o'clock in New Zealand,

36:05.860 --> 36:08.460
but we're the ones sitting on digital gold,

36:08.460 --> 36:10.820
so that'd be good fun.

36:12.540 --> 36:15.020
But I thought you couldn't do this outside the U.S.

36:16.020 --> 36:18.420
So you have most of your clients in New Zealand,

36:18.420 --> 36:19.420
not Australia, right?

36:19.420 --> 36:20.980
Because you're from New Zealand.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.740
Yeah, dude.

36:23.740 --> 36:24.580
Yeah, weird.

36:24.580 --> 36:26.420
I didn't know you could do this in other countries.

36:26.420 --> 36:27.260
Weird.

36:28.780 --> 36:29.620
Just kidding.

36:29.620 --> 36:31.980
I honestly didn't know that New Zealand was such a market.

36:31.980 --> 36:32.820
That's awesome.

36:32.820 --> 36:33.660
That's great.

36:33.660 --> 36:34.500
I thought it was just like, honestly,

36:34.500 --> 36:36.340
me and the Australian in the U.S., but that's great.

36:36.340 --> 36:37.180
That's sick, dude.

36:37.180 --> 36:38.020
That's sick.

36:38.020 --> 36:39.860
Keep going.

36:39.860 --> 36:42.300
Jerry says, how is your week slash month structured

36:42.300 --> 36:44.060
for achieving those 40K?

36:44.100 --> 36:46.780
What are the crucial tasks you do to progress that fast?

36:46.780 --> 36:48.820
And he says, by the way,

36:48.820 --> 36:50.020
I've got pretty similar goal in mind

36:50.020 --> 36:52.660
with the Muay Thai mastery,

36:52.660 --> 36:54.900
whatever combat sports you're in.

36:54.900 --> 36:55.740
You're really inspiring.

36:55.740 --> 36:56.980
Thanks for the nuggets you dropped so far.

36:56.980 --> 37:00.180
So I guess kind of how you structure to move the needle.

37:01.780 --> 37:02.740
Yes, we do.

37:02.740 --> 37:04.900
Thanks for the compliment on inspiration.

37:04.900 --> 37:06.500
In terms of moving the needle,

37:07.940 --> 37:09.660
I honestly don't have too much structure in my business.

37:09.660 --> 37:12.180
Like my whole mindset is just wake up

37:12.180 --> 37:13.860
and like get in the trenches basically,

37:14.700 --> 37:17.540
but that being said, where I'm at now with the business,

37:18.420 --> 37:22.020
what actually got me from 10 to 40 was,

37:22.020 --> 37:24.860
what does 40K and Mike do?

37:24.860 --> 37:26.740
What does 40K and Mike do?

37:26.740 --> 37:29.180
And I literally embodied that at the start of the year

37:29.180 --> 37:30.700
while everyone was partying for New Year's.

37:30.700 --> 37:34.660
I was reading books on productivity

37:34.660 --> 37:39.660
and it took nine months to catch up with the actions

37:40.180 --> 37:43.380
in terms of hitting the 40K a month goal.

37:43.420 --> 37:47.020
Some key parts of that were also getting my CRM dialed in.

37:47.020 --> 37:50.420
So I've got to thank Ben Van Harten in the group.

37:50.420 --> 37:55.420
He's actually in digital business in Thailand.

37:55.500 --> 37:56.940
So getting your CRM sorted,

37:58.580 --> 38:00.180
that's extremely important.

38:00.180 --> 38:02.460
Getting your lead reporting sorted,

38:02.460 --> 38:05.420
getting some sort of system to look at your prospecting deals

38:05.420 --> 38:08.420
and obviously how many leads your current clients are getting.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.220
And I'm going to thank Ryan Dalton.

38:11.220 --> 38:13.660
He's actually an integral part of the business

38:13.660 --> 38:16.580
in terms of outsourcing some of my web builds

38:16.580 --> 38:19.700
and also his RankinRent engine system.

38:19.700 --> 38:21.300
I wouldn't be here without that.

38:22.980 --> 38:24.300
Beautiful.

38:24.300 --> 38:27.260
And as a teaser,

38:28.220 --> 38:33.220
the version 2.0 of Ryan's RankinRent engine

38:33.940 --> 38:36.460
is very close to being completed.

38:36.460 --> 38:38.020
So more to come on that.

38:38.020 --> 38:39.060
Anyway, keep going.

38:40.060 --> 38:42.060
Yeah, we got some really good comments here.

38:42.060 --> 38:43.820
I'll just mainly go to the questions,

38:43.820 --> 38:45.020
but we got some really cool comments

38:45.020 --> 38:46.940
and a lot of people appreciate what you're saying, Mike.

38:46.940 --> 38:49.060
So thanks a lot for hopping on.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.020
Matthew, he kind of has like a similar question.

38:51.020 --> 38:52.860
He says, yeah, like, what do you do?

38:52.860 --> 38:55.220
What does your week look like in terms of delegating tasks

38:55.220 --> 38:56.860
for grabbing deals?

38:56.860 --> 38:59.020
And I mean, I guess I can just say,

38:59.020 --> 39:00.980
probably put in the way you got to 40K

39:00.980 --> 39:02.980
was by selling $40,000 worth of deals.

39:02.980 --> 39:03.980
So obviously that sales part.

39:03.980 --> 39:05.980
So I'll personally ask, like,

39:05.980 --> 39:07.220
do you still do the closing calls

39:07.220 --> 39:09.060
and like, have you outsourced everything

39:09.060 --> 39:10.220
about the sales or?

39:12.540 --> 39:14.860
So the only thing I'm outsourcing at the moment

39:14.860 --> 39:19.540
is the SEO builds, the SEO website builds.

39:19.540 --> 39:23.140
And I've got a guy that does all my blogging

39:23.140 --> 39:25.540
and I think he employs his cousins in the Philippines.

39:25.540 --> 39:28.260
So yeah, I mean, I'm on 40,000 USD a month

39:28.260 --> 39:32.620
and I don't have a big team.

39:32.620 --> 39:36.540
I haven't got a huge bill of people that I have to pay.

39:36.740 --> 39:38.220
The profit margins are pretty good.

39:38.220 --> 39:40.740
I've got my Google ads bill and then I've got maybe

39:42.380 --> 39:45.180
three to $4,000 of blog post costs

39:45.180 --> 39:47.740
and outsourcing to Ryan's team.

39:47.740 --> 39:49.620
And in six months, those costs,

39:49.620 --> 39:51.980
the profit margins are gonna be even bigger.

39:53.020 --> 39:54.180
So yeah, I'm pretty proud of the fact

39:54.180 --> 39:57.940
that I only have one person that I really outsource to

39:57.940 --> 39:59.740
and the rest is just on autopilot.

40:01.380 --> 40:03.060
So are you still handling all the sales yourself,

40:03.060 --> 40:06.820
like the prospecting and the setup and the close?

40:08.260 --> 40:10.580
Yeah, so I still do all the sales calls.

40:12.580 --> 40:13.420
Yeah, pretty much.

40:13.420 --> 40:15.660
People, the way I do my prospecting

40:15.660 --> 40:17.860
is I actually get people coming to me now

40:17.860 --> 40:19.500
just through my Instagram profile.

40:21.540 --> 40:24.660
But yeah, we'll see if I need to employ some more people

40:24.660 --> 40:26.540
to get to $66,000 in a month.

40:26.540 --> 40:29.300
But I think the way that everything's set up

40:29.300 --> 40:30.660
and systematized and automated,

40:30.660 --> 40:32.140
I think I'll be able to get to $66,000

40:32.140 --> 40:35.980
without having to figure out building a team,

40:35.980 --> 40:36.820
more of a team.

40:38.260 --> 40:39.100
That's awesome, bro.

40:39.100 --> 40:42.260
We got just like one more question.

40:42.260 --> 40:45.420
Nathan, guys, he put in the link to the book.

40:45.420 --> 40:48.540
So thank you for that for systematology, systemology.

40:49.420 --> 40:50.700
Oh, we got two quick questions

40:50.700 --> 40:53.460
and then you can just fire these.

40:53.460 --> 40:55.860
So Jared said, is your technical SEO team

40:55.860 --> 40:58.740
in Thailand with you?

40:58.780 --> 41:00.780
So it sounds like you just got that one guy.

41:02.220 --> 41:03.940
Yeah, so we're a team in the Philippines.

41:03.940 --> 41:06.900
Just one guy doing the blogs with his cousins

41:06.900 --> 41:08.300
and a bit of WordPress work.

41:10.060 --> 41:11.780
Cool, so that's the other.

41:11.780 --> 41:12.620
Did you get them?

41:13.740 --> 41:14.580
Oh, sorry, I was gonna say,

41:14.580 --> 41:16.740
did you get them on onlinejobs.ph

41:16.740 --> 41:18.180
or where'd you find that guy?

41:19.260 --> 41:20.580
Yeah, onlinejobs.ph.

41:20.580 --> 41:22.300
I've been with him for eight months.

41:22.300 --> 41:23.140
He's amazing.

41:23.140 --> 41:25.460
I definitely recommend onlinejobs.ph

41:25.460 --> 41:27.380
for outsourcing really respectful people

41:27.380 --> 41:29.900
with good English and if you treat them well,

41:29.900 --> 41:30.940
they treat you well.

41:33.140 --> 41:33.980
That's awesome, man.

41:33.980 --> 41:34.820
Yeah, we just got one more question.

41:34.820 --> 41:36.860
Nathan says, and I know this depends on

41:36.860 --> 41:37.740
if you ask this question now,

41:37.740 --> 41:38.860
or like you said, in six months,

41:38.860 --> 41:39.900
once a lot of your sites rank,

41:39.900 --> 41:42.540
but how much of the 40K per month is profit?

41:42.540 --> 41:44.140
Just about.

41:45.980 --> 41:49.700
About 60, 65%.

41:49.700 --> 41:51.500
Wow, that's awesome.

41:53.460 --> 41:55.180
Yeah, I'm ranking these sites really fast

41:55.180 --> 41:56.940
thanks to Ryan's team,

41:57.580 --> 41:58.420
and the way they set everything up.

41:58.420 --> 42:00.940
So I'm able to like reduce the ad spins pretty quickly.

42:05.420 --> 42:08.780
And guys, just to add to that real quick,

42:09.780 --> 42:13.020
if Mike were to take everything in-house

42:13.020 --> 42:16.180
and do it all himself and be a solopreneur,

42:16.180 --> 42:17.820
apart from the ad costs that he has,

42:17.820 --> 42:22.820
I bet he would be closer to 70, 72, 75% profit margin,

42:22.940 --> 42:24.860
but he's doing exactly what I did,

42:24.860 --> 42:26.220
which is he's building out a team.

42:26.220 --> 42:27.460
He's got people doing content.

42:27.460 --> 42:29.660
He's scaling it,

42:29.660 --> 42:31.700
and he's also got an incredible lifestyle.

42:31.700 --> 42:34.780
So you can do this as much,

42:34.780 --> 42:36.300
like he's doing it smart.

42:36.300 --> 42:37.940
So yeah, he's got a 55% profit.

42:37.940 --> 42:40.220
Let's say he's bringing in, what is it?

42:40.220 --> 42:43.540
22, $23,000 in his pocket every single month,

42:43.540 --> 42:45.100
quarter million bucks.

42:45.100 --> 42:46.860
That's his money,

42:46.860 --> 42:49.740
but he doesn't have to do jack shit.

42:49.740 --> 42:54.140
That's why he's fighting Muay Thai fights, right?

42:54.140 --> 42:56.100
And that's the beauty of the entire thing.

42:56.860 --> 42:58.700
Some of you guys are so scared to get somebody

42:58.700 --> 43:00.700
because, oh, I'm gonna have a recurring cost,

43:00.700 --> 43:03.700
and I gotta, good, just go replace it.

43:05.620 --> 43:08.340
Your content person right now,

43:08.340 --> 43:10.500
I'm sure you, I don't know, maybe,

43:10.500 --> 43:11.340
how long have you had that person?

43:11.340 --> 43:12.180
He's had eight months.

43:12.180 --> 43:13.820
So you've had them since the time

43:13.820 --> 43:15.980
you were probably at 25,000,

43:15.980 --> 43:18.580
and you probably added one or two of his cousins,

43:18.580 --> 43:21.820
but you guys, we're trying to scale this thing.

43:21.820 --> 43:25.380
We're not just trying to keep every dollar in our pocket

43:25.380 --> 43:26.940
and do all the work.

43:26.940 --> 43:28.420
It's a lifestyle as well.

43:30.060 --> 43:34.660
50%, and let's look at my 38 current deals.

43:34.660 --> 43:38.140
Let's say it's about a 60 or a 55% profit margin.

43:38.140 --> 43:40.300
Those same 37 clients in a year's time,

43:40.300 --> 43:43.180
I can guarantee they're gonna be 95% profit margin.

43:43.180 --> 43:45.740
So I'm investing and taking over the Google board

43:45.740 --> 43:46.820
and getting these sites,

43:46.820 --> 43:49.900
just printing money every week on all their partners.

43:49.900 --> 43:50.740
By the way.

43:50.740 --> 43:52.540
I put in the work, ranking them.

43:52.540 --> 43:54.820
I love that you call it the Google board.

43:55.380 --> 43:56.580
I heard that on one of your videos

43:56.580 --> 43:58.340
and I was like, I like that.

43:58.340 --> 44:00.620
It sounds like it's like an interesting way

44:00.620 --> 44:02.020
to say it, the Google board.

44:03.660 --> 44:04.580
The monopoly board.

44:04.580 --> 44:06.180
I'm still running the same sales script,

44:06.180 --> 44:08.500
telling them it's the monopoly board and they love it.

44:08.500 --> 44:10.340
I know exactly what you mean.

44:10.340 --> 44:11.940
I just have never heard it called the Google board

44:11.940 --> 44:13.740
and it makes total sense,

44:13.740 --> 44:14.940
and it's kind of a fun way to say it.

44:14.940 --> 44:16.780
So anyway, just kind of just a side note.

44:19.500 --> 44:22.900
Mike, dude, I have so many more questions,

44:22.900 --> 44:23.860
but we don't have time.

44:23.860 --> 44:25.700
I'm gonna send you some voice notes on WhatsApp

44:25.700 --> 44:27.420
about some stuff.

44:28.940 --> 44:31.300
But dude, more than anything,

44:31.300 --> 44:36.300
I think obviously kudos to you because you did the work.

44:37.660 --> 44:41.060
You make the program and us look good,

44:41.060 --> 44:44.100
but I do appreciate you coming on, bro.

44:44.100 --> 44:44.940
I hope you know that.

44:44.940 --> 44:49.940
And everybody please give Mike a thanks for jumping on

44:50.540 --> 44:51.580
and spending his time.

44:52.580 --> 44:54.820
Dude, when are you gonna hit?

44:54.820 --> 44:58.220
What's the goal to hit the 50?

44:58.220 --> 45:00.780
Like, so a thousand, you're doing about a deal a week.

45:00.780 --> 45:03.460
So what, in about 90 days, roughly?

45:05.580 --> 45:08.100
Yeah, I want to get to a hundred thousand New Zealand dollars

45:08.100 --> 45:09.660
where we'll get there.

45:09.660 --> 45:12.500
And I think that's about 66,000 USD.

45:12.500 --> 45:14.420
And I think after that,

45:14.420 --> 45:16.540
I'm just gonna be focusing a bit more on

45:16.540 --> 45:17.660
traveling more around the world

45:18.660 --> 45:21.700
and getting a bit more systematization done.

45:22.700 --> 45:24.140
I love that, bro.

45:24.140 --> 45:25.220
Unbelievable.

45:26.220 --> 45:30.500
It's unbelievable that we, I don't know.

45:30.500 --> 45:32.220
Do you ever get this way sometimes you wake up

45:32.220 --> 45:34.060
and you're like, dude, I'm literally selling air.

45:34.060 --> 45:36.340
Like you guys have seen the Lorax, right?

45:36.340 --> 45:38.380
Have you guys seen the Lorax, that movie?

45:40.300 --> 45:41.980
Yeah, a while back.

45:41.980 --> 45:43.740
You don't have to, if you haven't,

45:43.740 --> 45:45.060
but you should watch it.

45:46.020 --> 45:46.860
It's hilarious.

45:46.860 --> 45:48.860
A Dr. Seuss movie.

45:48.860 --> 45:51.980
And the guy, that little short guy,

45:51.980 --> 45:55.820
the something O'Hare, I don't know his first name.

45:55.820 --> 45:58.500
He's a little short guy with the most amazing haircut.

45:58.500 --> 46:00.140
He sells air.

46:00.140 --> 46:01.980
Like he's literally like polluting the air

46:01.980 --> 46:02.820
and selling it back to him.

46:02.820 --> 46:04.220
But I always am like, dude,

46:05.260 --> 46:07.220
I swear it's like we're selling air.

46:07.220 --> 46:09.780
Like we're just giving these people the,

46:09.780 --> 46:12.980
but it's also a valuable service because

46:13.980 --> 46:16.620
like you could argue, well, if you didn't do this,

46:16.620 --> 46:18.540
then they would get, no, they wouldn't get the leads.

46:18.540 --> 46:20.420
The leads would go to the home advisors

46:20.420 --> 46:22.820
and the Angie's list and the big guys.

46:22.820 --> 46:25.860
We're fighting between the little guys.

46:25.860 --> 46:27.260
So no, just because we're in there

46:27.260 --> 46:28.540
doesn't mean those leads would go to them.

46:28.540 --> 46:30.020
That's not true at all.

46:30.020 --> 46:32.060
We're taking the leads from the big guys.

46:32.060 --> 46:33.500
We're partnering with the little guys

46:33.500 --> 46:34.820
and we're helping them do business.

46:34.820 --> 46:37.860
So I joke about us selling air

46:37.860 --> 46:40.700
because it feels like we're cheating,

46:40.820 --> 46:43.020
but we're offering something that's so valuable

46:43.020 --> 46:45.100
that it's changes these businesses entirely.

46:45.100 --> 46:47.540
So anyway, Mike, thanks for jumping on, bro.

46:49.020 --> 46:50.620
It's my fault in that way.

46:50.620 --> 46:52.940
Yeah, it doesn't seem like it's real business sometimes

46:52.940 --> 46:54.380
when you're just looking at these Stripe accounts

46:54.380 --> 46:56.380
for the green ticks coming in

46:56.380 --> 46:57.340
and you're getting the head massage.

46:57.340 --> 46:59.940
But I've got some feedback recently

46:59.940 --> 47:01.180
from some guys in New Zealand

47:01.180 --> 47:04.260
that their businesses were gonna go under.

47:04.260 --> 47:05.820
Like they were literally gonna have to close down

47:05.820 --> 47:08.140
their shops and I get messages saying,

47:08.140 --> 47:10.140
hey, like we're on a pretty grim spot.

47:10.420 --> 47:12.380
You've literally saved us.

47:12.380 --> 47:13.220
We're now at a point

47:13.220 --> 47:14.540
where we could be taking on more people.

47:14.540 --> 47:16.820
So like we usually are changing people's lives.

47:16.820 --> 47:20.140
So it's a beautiful business model

47:20.140 --> 47:22.620
in pretty much every way possible.

47:22.620 --> 47:24.100
It's dope, dude.

47:24.100 --> 47:24.940
I love it.

47:24.940 --> 47:25.940
Awesome, thanks for jumping on.

47:25.940 --> 47:28.460
And Aaron, thank you as well, brother.

47:30.380 --> 47:31.380
Thanks, guys.

47:31.380 --> 47:32.220
Cheers.

47:32.220 --> 47:33.040
Talk to you soon, guys.

47:33.040 --> 47:33.880
See you, bye.
