1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,360
Live transferring the samples. There is a correct way to do this and I'm going to teach

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,640
it to you right now. The first thing I want to mention is this, if you are somebody that

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,360
has a job, if you are somebody that doesn't have the ability or doesn't want to have to

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,120
be glued to their phone all day every day, welcome to the club. I'm somebody where if

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,760
I get a call in the middle of the day and I picked up every single call, I would never

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,120
get anything done. My mind would be here and it would be here and it would be here. I have

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,240
to put my phone on silent. For some of you guys that are trying to get a hold of me sometimes,

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,240
that's why. I have to put my phone on silent for this to work, for me to be able to do anything,

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,760
to be productive at all. I totally understand that and I don't want you guys to worry.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,160
If you are somebody that can't answer in the day because of a job or anything else,

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,280
it's okay. Here's what I do is I wait, I let all my calls go to voicemail or missed call or whatever

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:09,040
and then I put a slot of time in my calendar every day and I on my time go and look at my missed

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,760
calls and I call them back. These are the leads. I call them back and do the live transfers on my

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,680
time. If you're somebody that's like, oh, this isn't going to work for me because I have a job,

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,680
it's fine. You can do it after work. You can do it on your lunch break. You can do it on

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,600
Saturdays and if you're like, oh my gosh, I don't get off work until five, doesn't matter.

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,320
People actually answer the phone more after work. Don't stress it. It's not the end of the world.

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,600
I'm just going to teach you guys really quick the best way to do the live transfer.

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,800
First thing I want to mention is a lot of people get confused with this. They're like, well,

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,040
do you call the lead and then you hook the business owner with the lead live? Here's the

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,200
process that I do. Just a quick overview. If I haven't hooked a business owner, let's say I'm

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,840
in my first pre-sale, my first campaign, my first deal or a deal. I haven't hooked a business owner.

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,880
I've set up the campaign. I've done my niche research. I'm good to go. I've done my city

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,760
research. I'm good to go. I've built my list. I've set up my ad and a lead comes in. What I

25
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,640
will typically do is I will get ahold of the lead. Let's say the lead's name is Janet. I don't know

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,120
why I really like using the name Janet for this example, but I'm going to use Janet. Janet calls.

27
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,600
I call her back. By the way, if you do call back, I want you to say the following. Hey, Janet,

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,520
this is Nick with St. George Tree Service. You might not know it's Janet. The only reason you

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,600
would know it was Janet is if she filled out a form. Let's just say, hey, this is Nick with

30
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,520
St. George Tree Service. By the way, I'm actually calling you from my cell phone. It's been a crazy

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,160
day, so I apologize for the weird area code. I'm guessing you need an estimate. If you notice how

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,280
I did that, I brought up the objection first because I know she's already thinking, what the

33
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,640
heck is your weird area code? I have the weirdest area code ever. I bring that up first and I assume

34
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,760
I'm like, hey, I'm guessing you need an estimate. I don't say, hey, do you need an estimate? Yes,

35
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,320
no question usually leads to a no. Even if they need one, they'll just go, oh, wait, what? Hey,

36
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,960
I'm guessing you need an estimate. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do. If you do call back, I want you to

37
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,280
say something to that extent of, hey, this is Nick with such and such company. You're going to act,

38
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,960
by the way, as the operator and you're going to let them know you're calling from your cell phone

39
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,480
because it's been a crazy day or you're on the road or you're out and about or whatever, or that's

40
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,440
just the number you grew up with because you want them to know that we are local. We want them to

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,960
know that the website is local. The first step is you're going to call the lead or answer the lead

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,400
and you are going to act as the operator, meaning you're going to act like you're just sitting there

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,000
answering the phone for the company. You work for the business owner or whatever. I typically,

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,760
if I'm answering it live, I'll say the same thing. Hey, this is Nick with St. George Tree Service.

45
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm guessing you need an estimate. Okay, cool. Let me grab your information. Okay, cool. What's

46
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,240
your address? Awesome. What's the best number to reach yet? Awesome. Okay, cool. Zip code.

47
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,800
I'll get all the information and I'll say this. All right, Janet. What I'm going to do is the

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,800
business owner, I'm going to get a hold of him and we're going to get you scheduled. He is on

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,400
a job right now. He's typically out running about doing estimates. Let me get a hold of him and

50
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,520
we'll be reaching back out ASAP. If you don't hear from us for a minute, it's because he's on

51
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,760
a job. Like I said, and by the way, I might be calling from an 854 area code. That's just my

52
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,320
cell phone, so don't worry about it. That's just me. We will be in touch very shortly. Awesome,

53
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,440
Janet. Thank you. Now, Janet, the lead is teed up because keep in mind, I haven't called the

54
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,600
business owner. Now, this is going to change. Once we call the business owner, this live transfer

55
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,040
process becomes more simple because we can immediately just transfer it over. For this

56
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,360
first one, I just have Janet teed up. Okay, so Janet's teed up and now we go and hook the

57
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,040
business owner. Okay, so go back to the last step and you're going to hook the business owner. So,

58
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,480
you're going to use the script and you got Janet and that's the lead that you're going to use.

59
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,160
Okay, so now we got a hold of the business owner and if you remember from last module,

60
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,040
if you didn't watch it, go watch it. We tell the business owner, hey, save this number right here

61
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,120
or save XYZ number, whatever number is going to be doing the live transfer. We are going to be

62
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,600
calling you and there's going to be a live person on the phone that wants an estimate. Okay,

63
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,280
you're going to hook the business owner and then what I will do is I'll hang up with the business

64
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,720
owner and then I will call Janet back. Okay, so I'll call Janet. Hey, Janet, it's Nick again with

65
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,440
St. George Tree Service again. Sorry for the weird area code. I know, I know. Cool. Hey, I actually

66
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,920
have Jim. I just barely spoke with him. He is kind of out and about right now but he wants to just

67
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,680
get you scheduled. So, hang on one second. I'm going to patch you in with him so we can get you

68
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,280
on the calendar and come give you a free estimate. Okay, so give me one second. Boom. I put her on

69
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,400
or I just wait and I push add call. Now, some of you guys are like, I'm overseas and I don't have

70
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,760
an iPhone or this doesn't work. There's a ton of tools. Guys, search the group, ask the questions.

71
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,920
There are tools. Everyone has found a workaround for this. I do know CallRel has an option where

72
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,760
you can get a phone number so you don't have to use your own cell phone and you can do a merge

73
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,880
feature. There's a lot of ways around this. Do not disrupt your hands and say, oh, it doesn't work

74
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,200
for me because I'm not in the U.S. and I don't have an iPhone or whatever. There is always a

75
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,120
solution so don't be that guy, don't be that lady. That's the first thing. Anyway, just a quick

76
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,600
caveat. Janet's right there and I push add call and I then push add call and I go find Jim and I

77
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,760
call Jim. Now, the way this works with the live transfer is she's going to be on mute and I'm

78
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,600
going to be speaking with Jim. Jim answers, hey Jim. I'm going to use my other hand so we know

79
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,400
we're talking to Jim. Hey Jim, Nick here again. Hey, I actually, like I told you, I had that lead,

80
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,440
that job, her name is Janet on the phone right now. So I just, to make it simple, I just told

81
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,040
her I work for you. I'm going to put you guys on a three-way call really quick and I'm just going

82
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,560
to have you schedule her. Just so you know, she has an oak tree, she needs it removed,

83
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,680
she's gotten a couple estimates, blah, blah, blah, and she's at 84790 just so you know. But again,

84
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,040
I just acted like I work for you so give me one second. Okay, cool. Okay, Jim's good. Jim's good,

85
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,360
Janet's good. Then I push this button that says merge. So I merge the call. Boom. Now everybody's

86
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,280
on the call. So what I say now is I go, hey Janet, can you hear me? Awesome. Hey Jim, can you hear me?

87
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,040
Cool. Hey guys, so Jim, this is Janet. She's the one I was telling you about. She needs her tree

88
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,200
removed. She's over at this street address. And Janet, this is Jim. He's my boss. He's the owner.

89
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,320
He's the one that's going to be coming and taking a look and giving you a free estimate. Anyway,

90
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,080
awesome guys. I'm going to take myself off the call. Appreciate it. And thanks again. Put yourself

91
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,880
on mute, okay? And your work is done. And now what you're going to do is you are going to listen,

92
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,760
okay? You're going to listen and you're going to listen to the business owner. You're going to make

93
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,720
sure he doesn't screw it up. You're going to listen to the business owner. Make sure he doesn't try to

94
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,160
undercut you. You're going to listen to the business owner. Make sure he schedules an estimate.

95
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,640
Make sure he does it correctly and he's not passive in all this different stuff and he's

96
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,800
not dropping price. This is going to give you an opportunity to see if this is a business owner you

97
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,640
want to work with, okay? So you're going to put yourself on mute and you're going to listen,

98
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,680
okay? You're going to listen to these calls. And I never ever jump back in on the call unless

99
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,520
I have to. So if the business owner, or sorry, if the customer starts going,

100
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,520
yeah, and maybe she thinks I'm off the call or whatever, she goes, yeah, so I thought I called

101
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,120
St. George Tree Service or I thought I called Southern Utah Tree Service, like, who are you?

102
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,080
Then I'll jump back in and go, hey, sorry, Janet, I'm still here. I just wanted to explain this.

103
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,080
The name of the company is Jim's Tree Service. That's just one of our websites. So just to clear

104
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,400
up that confusion. Anyway, go ahead, guys. I'll jump back in if necessary, but it's very, very,

105
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,800
very rare. It's only to save the deal if I can just see it's going sideways. Or if the business

106
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,520
owner starts going, yeah, this guy just called me out of nowhere, then I'll cut him off and be like,

107
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:44,560
hey, bro, I'm still on the line. I'm going to control that process, that handoff, because,

108
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,280
guys, this is digital gold. I'm not just going to let them screw up a lead, but I'm also not

109
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,520
going to jump in and be all weird. But the biggest thing is you guys want to listen to how these

110
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,400
business owners are handling the customer. All right, guys, the last thing that I want to mention

111
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,320
is what happens if you call Janet and you tell the business owner, answer your freaking phone,

112
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,960
save my number, blah, blah, blah. Then you call Janet, you get ahold of Janet, you go to transfer

113
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,200
the call and freaking business owner still doesn't answer. And it is very frustrating. I totally

114
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,960
understand that because now you're like, oh my gosh, Janet's going to think I look like I'm an

115
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,760
idiot. Here's what you're going to do. You're not going to panic. You're not going to be weird.

116
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,440
You're simply going to tell Janet, you're going to say, hey, Janet, he must have got tied up on

117
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,080
another job or on a call. So here's what we'll do. This is going to be the easiest thing just to make

118
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,560
sure it's okay with you. I'm going to just put you, in fact, don't ask. Don't ask. I don't know

119
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,120
why you even said that. Don't freaking ask if it's okay with you. Just do. Hey, Janet, here's what

120
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,520
we're going to do. He's on another job, whatever. I'm actually going to put you in a three-way group

121
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,360
text with me, you, and him. And he's going to message you and find a time to call you and get

122
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,200
you scheduled for an estimate. Okay? So watch for that here in just a moment and we will be out very

123
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,560
soon. And then what you're going to do is you're going to do the same thing. You're going to have

124
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,840
them both on the group text. Hey, Janet, this is Jim. Jim, this is Janet, blah, blah, blah, just like

125
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,000
you would on a live transfer. But what this three-way text allows you to do is it allows you to

126
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,280
monitor the whole situation, allows you to watch and see if the business owner even gets a hold

127
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:20,000
of the lead, if he even is taking action, if he's even incentivized to go after it. Because

128
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
sometimes you'll send these leads and you think, oh, these guys are calling these leads. They're

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,720
not. Okay? So you doing the three-way text, it lets the business owner know, hey, I'm watching

130
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,080
this thing and you better be texting her back because I just gave you a job. Okay? So that is

131
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,000
the next best option if the business owner does not answer. Now, I don't want you thinking, oh,

132
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,880
I'll just do group text. I'll just do three-way text. I promise you, look me in the freaking eyes.

133
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,880
I promise you doing a live transfer is far better. But the second best option, if they don't answer

134
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,400
because it's going to happen, okay, you're going to do the three-way text. All right, guys. So that

135
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:04,960
is it for how to actually send and actually perform the live transfers. Do it exactly as I say.

136
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,040
You can use the same lines that I've used. You can use the verbiage that I've used. Act as the

137
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,840
operator. Do it exactly as I've done. I've tried. Trust me. And for the third time, I have tried

138
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,480
every way under the sun. This is the most effective, quickest way to get them leads and close

139
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,520
the deal.
