WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.440
Beautiful. Hey guys, welcome to the call for those of you that are just joining. And that's

00:06.440 --> 00:09.920
something else. Aaron, you know what you need to do? Make a comment in the comments that

00:09.920 --> 00:12.480
says, cut on your camera if you want to stay on the call because people are going to join

00:12.480 --> 00:16.040
and not have any idea. So like a good idea. I'll pin that. Yeah, just go ahead and pin

00:16.040 --> 00:21.600
that. Welcome to the call guys. Stoked about what we're going to talk about today. We are,

00:21.600 --> 00:27.720
if you guys can't tell, we're going extremely niche on these topics. We're going very, very

00:27.720 --> 00:33.480
nuanced because this business model is nuanced. There's the high level. And then there's also

00:33.480 --> 00:41.080
the heck. Dude, I got to turn off my notifications, bro. Hold on. I got like all kinds of stuff

00:41.080 --> 00:46.000
coming on, but I've got it. They got, let me just plug this in. But what you'll realize

00:46.000 --> 00:49.880
with this business, what I was saying is that you have the business model, the overall business

00:49.880 --> 00:55.200
model from a high level, build a simple website, rank it, send leads. And then there's so many

00:55.200 --> 01:00.400
nuances and the better you get at the nuances, the more money that you make. And so that's

01:00.400 --> 01:05.720
why we're basically taking this. If you haven't noticed month by month, quarter by quarter,

01:05.720 --> 01:10.480
we're focusing on different steps of the process and going very, very detailed on these steps

01:10.480 --> 01:14.600
of process. So we're still talking about the very first step, which is picking the city

01:14.600 --> 01:18.920
in the niche. But today we're going to talk about the pros and cons of going broad versus

01:18.920 --> 01:26.000
vertical or wide versus narrow, however you want to look at it. So that said, guys, as

01:26.000 --> 01:30.160
always, the reason that we, like I've been saying the last couple of weeks is I think

01:30.160 --> 01:35.800
our, is our fourth call, Aaron, something like, yeah, this is actually our fifth. So

01:35.800 --> 01:41.840
it's our fifth call doing it that this format and I've really enjoyed it. I swear to you

01:41.840 --> 01:45.400
guys, I'd rather have two people on this call that are paying attention than have a hundred

01:45.400 --> 01:50.640
people on a live and Facebook that are not paying attention. So that said, if you guys

01:50.640 --> 01:55.200
stay on this call the entire time cameras on by the end, we're going to screenshot.

01:55.200 --> 02:01.000
We're going to send you guys a digital resource with the notes in like a very easy to digest

02:01.000 --> 02:05.080
manner that you guys can check out. And so then you don't sit there and focus on writing

02:05.080 --> 02:09.440
everything I say down. You can just write down the things that come to your mind that,

02:09.440 --> 02:13.320
Hey, I should do this or here's an idea, that kind of stuff. And then you're going to get

02:13.320 --> 02:19.160
the, the, the digital resource of the notes and kind of the summary of what we talked

02:19.160 --> 02:22.800
about. So that said, keep, make sure once again, keep your cameras on. We want to make

02:22.800 --> 02:28.280
sure that we see your pretty smiling faces. We only let people in here that are serious

02:28.280 --> 02:34.000
about taking action and that's the truth. Okay. So that said, guys, let's get into today's

02:34.000 --> 02:41.320
topic, which is should you go broad or vertical? Aaron, I want to ask you really quick. I didn't

02:41.320 --> 02:44.780
even tell you, I was going to ask you, but when you first started out, I know you probably

02:44.780 --> 02:48.920
know the, what the answer that I would give, but did you start off by going vertical or

02:48.920 --> 02:57.360
did you start off by going broad? Well, I like, and I first found you from this business.

02:57.360 --> 03:01.160
And so I've immediately like adopted your mentality. So it's been that's checked through

03:01.160 --> 03:08.160
the whole time. And that said, it made more sense to get established in a couple, use

03:08.200 --> 03:11.840
one niche, do that a couple of times to get established. Cause it is easier to just stick

03:11.840 --> 03:16.680
with one niche already know rather than transition. There's different keywords, different lingo,

03:16.680 --> 03:19.960
different pricing, all that sort of stuff, different lead flow. And so it seems easier

03:19.960 --> 03:23.800
to get, get your feet wet, get established with a couple deals in one niche. You don't

03:23.800 --> 03:26.960
want to get reliant on that niche, but get established and then move on with what you

03:26.960 --> 03:33.960
did year by year. Yes, exactly. Okay. Good. Good to know. I'm curious in the comments,

03:34.920 --> 03:39.040
what do you guys think is the best option? And I don't want you to tell me what you think

03:39.040 --> 03:44.200
I want to hear. I want to know what you guys think. I want you to either put broad or vertical

03:44.200 --> 03:51.200
broad meaning you try out a bunch of niches, you, you die, you, what's the word you diversify

03:51.840 --> 03:57.240
or you pick an edge and you go vertical. Which do you guys think again? And by the way, some

03:57.240 --> 04:00.920
of you guys might think that you know the answer I'm looking for. And the thing you

04:00.920 --> 04:04.560
don't know about me or you might not realize about me is I change, I change all the time

04:04.560 --> 04:09.400
because I'm constantly growing and evolving in business. So my answer, you think that

04:09.400 --> 04:12.400
I might be giving you guys, I think some of you guys think you already know what I'm about

04:12.400 --> 04:15.960
to talk about. I might change. I might shock you with the answer I'm going to give you

04:15.960 --> 04:21.800
today because things change, man. Business changes. What worked in 2020 doesn't necessarily

04:21.800 --> 04:26.920
work today. So I am curious in the comments and Aaron, I want you to read the comments.

04:26.920 --> 04:31.040
I've got kind of my notes pulled up here. So I can't really see the comments and I want

04:31.040 --> 04:36.080
to be going back and forth. But let me know what people are saying, narrow or broad.

04:36.080 --> 04:41.400
Yeah. So a paper bully says vertical. So I can focus on building a system. Okay. Kind

04:41.400 --> 04:45.280
of like what I was just saying. Yeah. Depends in France. Theo says I diversify. Okay. That's

04:45.280 --> 04:50.520
interesting. Maybe there's limited cities. So you kind of got to go into different niches

04:50.520 --> 04:58.240
for the bigger cities. Broad in a good city. Shane thought that. No, let me see. Discord

04:58.240 --> 05:04.600
users said too early in my journey. I'm tempted to try broad and local area to start. So yeah.

05:04.600 --> 05:08.040
And then we got one more from Zoom users who said broad to see which niche I vibe with.

05:08.040 --> 05:15.080
Okay. That's interesting. Cool. Okay. Good. All right. That said, one quick thing I should

05:15.080 --> 05:19.360
have started with this. You guys shouldn't listen to what I'm saying. You guys, if you're

05:19.360 --> 05:22.840
brand new to whether it's a Facebook group, the discord channel, and that's how you found

05:22.840 --> 05:26.740
this, you should be asking yourself who the heck is this guy? Why should I listen to him?

05:26.740 --> 05:30.960
And so just my one minute reason why you should potentially consider listening to me is guys,

05:30.960 --> 05:36.000
I've been doing this for a long time. It's been over eight years. Now there was, I always

05:36.000 --> 05:39.400
throw this in because I don't want to make it seem like what it's not, but there was

05:39.400 --> 05:43.960
a eight, nine month period that I had shiny penny syndrome and chased a software company

05:43.960 --> 05:48.280
that completely failed. But for the most part of that eight years, I've been doing this

05:48.280 --> 05:54.200
business model. I spent $1.45 million on ads. I haven't recently checked it, so I don't

05:54.200 --> 06:00.120
know if it's more, but that's the last time I checked. I went $60,000 in debt. I almost

06:00.120 --> 06:07.360
quit twice. I did the wrong revenue model. I did pay per lead, which I think is completely

06:07.360 --> 06:13.360
the wrong way to do it for a couple of years. I've done everything wrong. And I finally

06:13.360 --> 06:17.760
figured it out in 2020 and realized that in order to scale this business, you need

06:17.760 --> 06:21.760
to presale. That's just how it is. And I know some of you guys are like, Hey, I'm just going

06:21.760 --> 06:26.600
to build it. I'm going to do it the slow way. Guys, the slow way of building a website and

06:26.600 --> 06:32.640
ranking it and then going and selling it is, I don't love this word, but well, I'm not

06:32.640 --> 06:36.440
going to use that word, but it's just stupid. It makes no sense. And the analogy that I

06:36.440 --> 06:41.840
always use, I was talking to one of my friends that's in this business, you going and building

06:41.840 --> 06:48.520
50 websites and then ranking them and then trying to sell them, that is equivalent to

06:48.520 --> 06:53.720
you going and building, let's say 50 or a hundred, whatever, the same amount of houses,

06:53.720 --> 06:58.720
say 50 houses. Imagine going and building 50 houses and realizing that you forgot to

06:58.720 --> 07:06.540
put in toilets. It's so dumb for you to go and do that. And by the way, just so you know,

07:06.540 --> 07:12.860
if you're getting the advice, you should go build 10 or 15 or 20. I would bet the people

07:12.860 --> 07:19.540
giving you that advice are also selling you the tools to build websites. Just a wild guess.

07:19.540 --> 07:24.420
They're probably selling you all kinds of services, tracking numbers, or maybe they're

07:24.420 --> 07:28.340
doing hosting or they're white labeling something. It's in their best interest that you build

07:28.340 --> 07:33.620
more websites. I don't sell any of those services, so I don't care. And I'm telling you right

07:33.620 --> 07:39.620
now, do not go and build a bunch of websites and try to rank them. And this isn't even

07:39.620 --> 07:42.660
what we're talking about, David. We want a little rant here because what you don't know

07:42.660 --> 07:46.580
right now, because you're brand new to this or you're not into this enough, that just

07:46.580 --> 07:50.580
because you build a website does not mean it's going to rank. I have built websites

07:50.580 --> 07:53.820
that have never ranked because it was too competitive. I didn't know what I was doing.

07:53.820 --> 07:57.940
Just because you build a website and it ranks does not mean you're going to get leads. I

07:57.940 --> 08:03.300
had a website in Lincoln, Nebraska in a specific industry, didn't even think to check a certain

08:03.860 --> 08:07.260
search volume and all that stuff. Dude, I never got any leads. I was ranked number one

08:07.260 --> 08:11.740
for all the keywords. There was no business there, right? Now that one, you usually are

08:11.740 --> 08:18.740
smart enough, but I wasn't. Just because you get a website ranked, you get leads, does

08:18.740 --> 08:22.940
not mean you're going to find a hungry business owner. I don't know how long you guys have

08:22.940 --> 08:26.340
been in this business, but for those of us that have been in it and for a minute, we've

08:26.340 --> 08:30.180
all had that situation where you build a website, you rank it, you're getting leads, and you

08:30.420 --> 08:34.980
for the life of you cannot find somebody to take the leads. You couldn't give them away

08:34.980 --> 08:39.540
because everyone in that city is fat and happy and they're just getting tons of leads. There's

08:39.540 --> 08:43.580
a ton of leads or there's not a lot of competition and they're the big dog in town and they're

08:43.580 --> 08:48.340
really not motivated to pay you for leads. So you just went and spent six months all

08:48.340 --> 08:53.380
this time, wrote the content, paid your employees, and now you can't sell it to a business owner,

08:53.380 --> 08:59.540
right? And so what if in a different universe, my universe, you could go, you could spend

08:59.540 --> 09:04.180
a couple bucks on ads, you could go in, land the deal, get the business owner, know that

09:04.180 --> 09:08.260
there's going to be lead flow, make sure the business owner's hungry, put the deal together,

09:08.260 --> 09:12.900
get the contract, get the credit card, recoup your costs and use their money to build out

09:12.900 --> 09:16.900
the property. And while you're ranking over the next six to eight months, be making money

09:16.900 --> 09:22.500
the entire time. No fool, even a fool would say that's a much better option. So just so

09:22.500 --> 09:27.700
you guys know, that is how you scale. If you guys think you're going to scale by building,

09:27.700 --> 09:32.580
you know, and then by building websites and then renting them, then you haven't been doing

09:32.580 --> 09:36.180
this long enough. And the reason I even figured this out was by force is because I sat there

09:36.180 --> 09:39.860
and I was like, I need to make a hundred thousand dollars a month or I want to, and I'm not going

09:39.860 --> 09:43.460
to keep doing this business unless I can make a hundred thousand. And I started doing my projections

09:43.460 --> 09:47.460
and I started doing my spreadsheets and I started going, all right, it's going to cost me how much

09:47.460 --> 09:51.380
for the hosting, how much for the tracking numbers, it's going to take me how long to rank.

09:51.380 --> 09:55.460
And I've got employees and I've got content, I've got this, I've got that. And statistically

09:55.460 --> 10:00.420
looking at my websites, only 30% or 50% of them actually work. And then I got to sell them all.

10:00.420 --> 10:03.620
And I started doing the math and it just didn't make sense. I was like, I'm going to have to go

10:03.620 --> 10:08.340
another 20 grand in debt and wait six months before I can even start selling these websites,

10:08.340 --> 10:12.820
guys. And that's what I'm like, dude, this isn't going to work unless I can pre-sell.

10:14.100 --> 10:19.620
And that's it. And that's why the big construction companies do exactly this. I was just, you guys

10:19.620 --> 10:23.620
know I'm in Dubai or maybe you don't, I'm in Dubai. I was at dinner with a friend on Saturday night.

10:23.700 --> 10:28.660
He's like, dude, I'm going to this, he's like, I'm going to this presentation tomorrow. I'm like,

10:28.660 --> 10:32.500
okay. It's actually today. He went this morning. He's like, I'm like, what's it for? He's like,

10:32.500 --> 10:36.500
well, there's this company and it's a company called EMAR. It's one of the largest, it might

10:36.500 --> 10:41.380
be the largest or if not one of the largest construction companies in the world. And basically

10:41.380 --> 10:47.220
he's like, you go in there, they're taking everyone's money upfront. You pay for the project

10:47.780 --> 10:51.300
and you pay your down payment. And then every six months you make a payment and then it's

10:51.300 --> 10:55.220
going to be done in two years. And by the time it's finished, it's going to be worth more than

10:55.220 --> 10:59.380
you bought it for. So I'm like, dude, that's really smart for you because you don't have to pay

10:59.380 --> 11:03.860
everything upfront. Plus it's going to be worth more, but it's even more smart for the company

11:03.860 --> 11:09.300
because guess what? They're pre-selling the building. They're literally raising capital

11:09.300 --> 11:14.900
from you, the user. They're saying, hey, I'll build this house once you agree to pay me for it.

11:14.900 --> 11:19.940
It's genius. So if the biggest companies in the world, EMAR that's in Dubai, that's built half

11:19.940 --> 11:24.340
this freaking city is doing this. Don't you think there's a lesson to be learned? And actually,

11:24.340 --> 11:27.940
funny enough, I've been doing this for years and I just barely heard this on Saturday and I made

11:27.940 --> 11:31.700
the connection. I'm like, huh, even these guys are doing it. So if there's just a little bit of

11:31.700 --> 11:35.540
a reason why maybe you should listen to me. And if you hear me just going off on these rants,

11:35.540 --> 11:41.540
it's because I've been doing this long enough that I've made the mistakes. I'm really just stupid,

11:41.540 --> 11:45.700
to be honest. And that's why I go and I make all these mistakes and I lose this money. And I'm like,

11:45.700 --> 11:50.180
oh, yeah, that's a good idea. Maybe I should try this. So that's why I'm here. Instead of you

11:50.180 --> 11:54.420
going and touching the stove and making sure it's hot, I could tell you it's hot telling you right

11:54.420 --> 11:57.940
now there's things you need to do. There's things you shouldn't do today. I'm going to do that exact

11:57.940 --> 12:03.220
same thing. So my goal for today, guys, is I want to give you all the pros and cons of going both

12:03.220 --> 12:06.820
broad and vertical. And I'm going to give you enough information that you can make a decision

12:06.820 --> 12:11.940
on which one you are going to choose as you start building your digital real estate empire, or as

12:11.940 --> 12:16.980
you continue to build it if you've already started. Now, one little caveat I want to mention

12:18.340 --> 12:24.260
is I am going to do my best to cover as much as possible. And I do want to leave time for Q&A

12:24.260 --> 12:28.420
because I haven't been doing a good job of that. But I'm going to give you most likely enough

12:29.540 --> 12:34.820
to get started. I can't cover in the next 45 minutes enough that you have all the information

12:34.820 --> 12:39.460
that you can go and make millions of dollars. The reality is I can't.

12:40.100 --> 12:46.820
I'm here to give you enough to get started and to give you some inspiration to get started and

12:46.820 --> 12:52.500
take your first steps. And so I'll use this analogy because I could literally spend 10

12:52.500 --> 12:56.100
hours talking about this one subject today because I've been doing it for so long.

12:56.100 --> 13:00.740
So it's kind of like this. I'm the guy I'm going to give you enough confidence that you're going

13:00.740 --> 13:04.900
to go buy a pair of gym shoes and you're going to get into the gym and you're going to know

13:04.900 --> 13:08.820
enough to not feel stupid. You're going to be able to walk around, know how to do bench press,

13:08.820 --> 13:14.100
do a couple biceps, whatever. That's what I'm doing on these calls. I'm going to give you enough

13:14.100 --> 13:19.460
that you don't feel stupid and you have enough like, okay, let me get started. But you cannot

13:19.460 --> 13:24.820
expect to go into that gym to know exactly, I want this body, which muscle should I work out?

13:24.820 --> 13:29.300
How should the sets be laid out? How should I do supersets? Should I not do supersets? Should I

13:29.300 --> 13:32.820
do this? Should I be humble with my rest days? What's my diet? You can't expect to know that

13:32.820 --> 13:38.420
unless you go and hire a trainer. So that said, guys, those people like me, a couple years ago,

13:38.420 --> 13:41.140
I was like, I want to get the best shape of my life. I went and found somebody that had the body

13:41.140 --> 13:46.980
I wanted my age and was completely natural, hired them, spent 20 grand sick. I literally got six

13:46.980 --> 13:51.700
zoom calls with this person and it changed everything the way I was. I was doing everything

13:51.700 --> 13:56.980
wrong. And I've been training for at that point over 10 years, 12 years, and they completely blew

13:56.980 --> 14:01.060
my mind. They gave me information that they spent 10 years getting. So I want to tell you this up

14:01.060 --> 14:06.340
front, because if you guys want the actual exact stuff, then you got to hire the trainer. That's

14:06.340 --> 14:09.860
why we have the digital landlord program. But I want to give you enough to get started to have

14:09.860 --> 14:14.260
enough confidence to just put one foot forward and get going. Okay. So here's going to be the

14:14.260 --> 14:18.660
outline today. And I am going to leave time for Q&A. I'm going to cover what exactly I mean by

14:18.660 --> 14:21.380
broad versus vertical. We'll go really quick on that because most people know what I'm talking

14:21.380 --> 14:27.140
about. I'm going to cover my experience doing broad first and then doing vertical. I'm going

14:27.140 --> 14:32.100
to talk about why life and this business is not black and white and varying shades of gray. And

14:32.100 --> 14:36.260
you'll know what I mean when I get to that. I'm going to talk about exactly what I did to scale

14:36.260 --> 14:40.180
and then I'm going to talk about the sweet spot and how is that digital resource.

14:40.900 --> 14:46.260
So let's do this. Aaron, at any point, if we have questions that seem relevant, please let me know.

14:47.780 --> 14:50.100
Is everyone still good? Aaron, can you hear me?

14:51.140 --> 14:55.140
Yeah, everything's great. Everyone's turned on the cameras. It's awesome to see everyone's

14:55.140 --> 14:59.060
faces. I'm just messaging this person who just joined. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. Okay,

14:59.060 --> 15:03.940
guys, let's get into it. So what do I mean by, and I want to keep this to 20 minutes tops,

15:03.940 --> 15:07.860
maybe 15. I want to leave Q&A. So guys, if you have Q&A, if you have questions you want to ask,

15:08.660 --> 15:12.580
start prepping them. You could literally throw them in the comments right now so you don't forget

15:12.580 --> 15:15.460
and I'll try to get to as many as possible. So I'm going to keep this less than 20 minutes. What

15:15.460 --> 15:21.300
do I mean by broad versus vertical? I'm going to keep it short. Broad is wide. Vertical is narrow.

15:21.300 --> 15:28.100
Broad means you decide to go into a bunch of different niches and vertical or narrow means

15:28.100 --> 15:33.140
you go into one niche and you go into a bunch of different cities. Okay, that's it. Very, very

15:33.140 --> 15:39.300
simple. Broad I think can be determined by or defined as two things because you could do a bunch

15:39.300 --> 15:44.580
of different niches in multiple cities or you could do a bunch of different niches in the same

15:44.580 --> 15:50.980
city. Okay, so that's what I mean by broad versus vertical. So let me tell you guys about my

15:50.980 --> 15:56.660
experience with doing broad first and then vertical. So when I got into my first training program,

15:57.380 --> 16:06.500
I learned a lot by the way and I needed it to get going. This is back in 2016. I wasn't ready to

16:06.500 --> 16:10.260
get it. I didn't even know I was buying it and then I was like, you know what, rather than trying

16:10.260 --> 16:14.260
to figure it out, whatever. So I bought it and I got this advice that I'm going to tell you,

16:14.260 --> 16:18.420
which I think is the wrong advice. And the reason it was the wrong advice is because it was outdated

16:18.420 --> 16:21.540
advice. And the reason it was outdated advice is because the person that created the program

16:21.540 --> 16:26.260
was not in the business. And that's why I'm always so adamant about letting you guys know I am still

16:26.260 --> 16:31.940
in this business. I am literally, I was just on the phone with Francesca on Saturday, Saturday

16:31.940 --> 16:36.820
at 9 p.m. before I met this guy for dinner. I was just talking about, I was on a call with Francesca

16:37.380 --> 16:42.260
and she was doing a sales call, right? And then we were talking about, she's got, we're still

16:42.260 --> 16:46.420
doing this, man. We're still literally in this business because if we're not, how the heck am

16:46.420 --> 16:51.140
I going to train you guys? So I got this advice from this first training that I bought and they

16:51.140 --> 16:57.940
said go and build 10, I think it was like 10 websites in 10 different niches. That was the

16:57.940 --> 17:03.620
advice. Go build 10 websites in 10 different niches. So that's what I did. I went and built

17:04.340 --> 17:07.700
10 different websites in 10 different niches. Now I didn't do it right away because I was busy

17:07.700 --> 17:12.180
and everything else, but I did not build two websites in the same niche until I had tried 10

17:12.180 --> 17:18.260
different niches, okay? So my first one was towing. My second one was this service called

17:18.260 --> 17:23.540
crawl space encapsulation. No, yeah, that was my second one. Then I built, did carpet cleaning.

17:23.540 --> 17:30.100
Then I did landscaping. Then I did, I'm trying to even think. I mean, they were terrible. Really,

17:30.100 --> 17:34.660
really bad ideas. So I can't even remember the other five, but I just did a bunch, right?

17:34.660 --> 17:38.340
And at the time I was living in Alabama. I was living in Huntsville, Alabama, knocking door. So

17:38.340 --> 17:44.740
my first five, three to five were in Huntsville, Alabama, right? Which means that my due diligence

17:44.740 --> 17:50.500
process was terrible because one of the chances that it's low-hanging fruit and not competitive

17:50.500 --> 17:55.380
in the same city, zero. And then when I moved back to Utah, after I got done with that job,

17:55.380 --> 17:59.700
I built the rest of my five in that city. So I didn't know what I was doing, but I got this

17:59.700 --> 18:04.260
advice, build 10 niches, try them out, see what you like, whatever. And I think one of the people

18:04.260 --> 18:08.660
that made a comment said that they want to try it out and see what they like. My advice to that is

18:08.660 --> 18:15.220
I don't care what I like. I like what makes money. Now, you don't have to be like me.

18:15.940 --> 18:19.140
If you want to make sure that you love the niche and you're interested in the niche and it's

18:19.140 --> 18:23.060
whatever, that's more important to you than the money that you make, then that is completely

18:23.060 --> 18:30.020
okay. But for me, I like what makes money. And that's why I do this business. Because even though

18:30.020 --> 18:34.660
building simple websites and renting them out isn't as cool as telling people I do jet rentals

18:34.660 --> 18:39.940
or I do jet charters or I sell Rolex watches or I sell cigars, it's kind of like sexy business.

18:40.500 --> 18:46.420
You know what's sexy about this business? Not working for a month and making a hundred thousand

18:46.420 --> 18:50.420
dollars in a month. You know what's sexy about this business? Deciding you're going to go to Dubai

18:50.420 --> 18:56.820
when you're in Vegas with your friends and driving to LA and taking a direct 16 hour flight to Dubai

18:56.820 --> 19:01.140
to stay for a month and business as usual. That's sexy. So I don't care what the business is. I

19:01.140 --> 19:06.260
don't care what the niche is. If it makes money, I'm passionate about that. That's just my take.

19:06.260 --> 19:11.140
I did the broad thing and my experience in it is that I spent the entire time

19:12.020 --> 19:15.940
learning and relearning all these different niches and I could never become the expert.

19:16.660 --> 19:20.980
It was always really tough. I never got the confidence because the first one I got was

19:20.980 --> 19:26.420
towing. And it was really tough to take my confidence from getting the towing deal

19:26.420 --> 19:32.020
and be like, yeah, but I did this for towing. It's going to work for crawl space. It's not as

19:32.020 --> 19:35.780
easy as if I would have got the towing and then went into another towing and then another towing

19:35.780 --> 19:40.340
and I would have been able to show example after example after example. My experience is I wasted

19:40.340 --> 19:46.100
a lot of time learning new niches and I never became the expert and I was never able to build

19:46.100 --> 19:52.260
momentum because I didn't know the lingo and I didn't know the gossip within. You guys,

19:52.260 --> 19:57.620
it's funny. Even inside big business, even inside industries, there's like gossip and there's big

19:57.620 --> 20:03.300
names and there's rumors and there's scandals and there's all kind of stuff. And when you know these

20:03.300 --> 20:08.420
little things, dude, it goes so freaking far and there's conferences and there's marketing

20:08.420 --> 20:12.740
companies that are always called the same companies and you know these little things by being inside

20:12.740 --> 20:20.180
of one industry. So in my experience, doing the 10 niches did not work well for me. Then what I

20:20.180 --> 20:29.300
tried to do is I tried to do one niche in 10 different cities. Now because I'm so not that

20:29.300 --> 20:35.380
smart sometimes, I did this. I'm thinking I'm going to do one niche in 10 different cities.

20:35.380 --> 20:40.500
I got the wrong niche. So if you're going to do that, make sure you got the right niche

20:40.500 --> 20:44.820
because at the time I didn't have someone telling me, hey, go into a tried and true niche

20:45.460 --> 20:52.100
and build in 10 different cities. In my opinion, out of the two, I would rather you

20:52.100 --> 20:56.820
choose a tried and true niche and build in 10 cities than choose 10 different niches.

20:57.540 --> 21:01.860
That's just my opinion. But I did, I was like, cool, I'm going to build in the same niche,

21:01.860 --> 21:05.700
10 different cities. Except for guess what, Nick, you forgot to make sure the niche was right. And

21:05.700 --> 21:10.660
I went to do a niche called foundation repair and it was an accident and one of them worked and the

21:10.660 --> 21:14.980
next nine did not. And not only did I go into 10 different cities, I went into about 50 different

21:14.980 --> 21:19.380
cities. And this is one of the things that really got me into debt because I thought I was in this

21:19.380 --> 21:24.660
really good niche. Meanwhile, I was in an uber competitive niche that I was getting my tail

21:24.660 --> 21:29.380
kicked in. And that was a couple deals away from going into debt, which is exactly what happened.

21:29.380 --> 21:34.740
And I went $60,000 in debt. Okay. Finally, what I realized between doing these two extremes is

21:34.740 --> 21:39.780
that it's actually a combination of both that matters. It's about finding the right niche

21:40.660 --> 21:46.340
and then going into the right cities. Okay. But based on the experience that I just told you,

21:46.340 --> 21:50.980
I would much rather you go into a boring tried and true niche, a concrete tree surface, artificial

21:50.980 --> 21:56.820
grass, masonry, fencing, you know all the ones that talk about duck cleaning, go into 10 cities

21:56.820 --> 22:02.580
is a much better strategy than going into 10 niches. Okay. That's just my two cents. Okay.

22:02.580 --> 22:06.340
But also I'm the kind of guy that's like, I wouldn't go and build 10 right out the gate either.

22:06.340 --> 22:14.340
I'd go and get 10 deals by using the pre-selling method. Okay. So that was my experience. And by

22:14.340 --> 22:17.780
the way, here in just a second, I'm going to get to what I would do today because I don't know if

22:17.780 --> 22:23.220
it would be the exact same. The other thing I want to cover really quick is that guys, I used to

22:23.220 --> 22:27.860
think that life was just black and white, right? There's good people. There's bad people. There

22:27.860 --> 22:31.780
was rich people. There was poor people. There was the right and wrong answer to everything.

22:31.780 --> 22:37.860
And then what you learn as you get older or as you get, I guess, burnt or as you get, I don't

22:37.860 --> 22:42.820
know, but you just learned that life is just varying shades of gray. Okay. And so the answer

22:42.820 --> 22:47.620
that I'm going to give you at the end is not going to be either or, just as a little teaser. I'm going

22:47.620 --> 22:57.060
to give you a bit of a hybrid, if I may. Okay. So one thing I want you guys to just remember is

22:57.060 --> 23:03.300
that there are other factors that come into play. So for example, I would never advise anyone to go

23:03.300 --> 23:11.220
into California, any part of California. However, if you live in California and you have family

23:11.220 --> 23:17.140
members that have businesses in California, you may be able to go into California and make money,

23:18.580 --> 23:24.020
right? But that's a one-off. So I just want to remind you guys that whatever I'm saying today,

23:24.420 --> 23:28.180
it's not black and white. There are varying shades of gray, and you may have a situation that makes

23:28.180 --> 23:34.260
you uniquely equipped to do something that maybe the rest of us can't, right? You may be a turf

23:34.260 --> 23:41.700
supplier that supplies turf to, or your salesperson or supplier, whatever, that sells turf to local

23:41.700 --> 23:46.820
contractors, in which case you have a completely different competitive advantage than we do. But

23:46.820 --> 23:51.540
so I just want to point that out that like it's not completely black and white. Okay. So one more

23:52.420 --> 23:55.540
thing I want to talk about, and then I'm going to get into what I would do today in the last 10

23:55.540 --> 24:02.420
minutes is, guys, what I did when I scaled, this is in 2020, things have changed, things do change,

24:02.420 --> 24:10.420
but what I had to do is in 2020, I had to get very simple. I had to get very focused. I had to get

24:10.420 --> 24:16.420
very dialed in. And so for me, because my brain, I can't really focus on a bunch of things at once.

24:16.420 --> 24:20.420
I do better if I know I'm going to do this one thing and I'm going to do it very well. I'm going

24:20.420 --> 24:25.140
to do it again and again and again, and I'm just going to get good at it. That's how my brain works.

24:25.140 --> 24:31.300
I had to just literally focus on one niche that was tried and true. And in 2020, that was Tree

24:31.300 --> 24:37.140
Service for me. And I had to spend all of my time focusing on how do I pre-sell? How do I set up

24:37.140 --> 24:42.660
ads and get people to pay me before I actually build a website? A, and then B, how do I actually

24:42.660 --> 24:50.740
have a formula to know that this specific city for Tree Service, I have a 97% confidence that I

24:50.740 --> 24:56.180
am going to be able to rank within three to six months? That was what I focused on. One niche,

24:56.740 --> 25:03.380
how do I pick, how do I develop a formula that is tried and true with a 97, 95% confidence? And then

25:04.100 --> 25:08.420
how do I pre-sell? That's what I focused on. I had to go into one niche. And to be honest, guys,

25:08.420 --> 25:11.540
you guys know my story or maybe you don't, but I think I shared a little bit of it earlier.

25:12.500 --> 25:18.900
That was what allowed me to go from barely making money, barely paying the bills,

25:18.900 --> 25:24.500
$8,000 to $10,000 a month to eight months later, July of 2020. I remember I was sitting at Lake Powell

25:25.060 --> 25:32.180
and my brother-in-law was like, how's business? And we're actually camping. Now we aren't even

25:32.180 --> 25:37.380
on a houseboat, which is awful by the way. It's sandy, it's windy, but I remember just sitting

25:37.380 --> 25:42.660
there. And while I was at Lake Powell, I had my two sales guys at the time had both closed a deal

25:42.660 --> 25:48.500
for a thousand bucks each, 250 bucks a week. I'd gotten two new deals. And if I annualize that out,

25:48.500 --> 25:55.220
thousand bucks times 12, 12,000 bucks times two, I put $24,000 in new revenue into my business. And

25:55.220 --> 26:00.820
I wasn't even there. Things were going well. And yeah, I remember telling him, I was like, yeah,

26:00.820 --> 26:05.140
dude, I think they're going really well. And I did the math and I was like, dude, we did $100,000.

26:05.140 --> 26:10.980
Like we're going to do $100,000 this month. And it was in July that we actually did $100,000.

26:12.740 --> 26:21.140
So that's how quickly this changed. Now that was in 2020, knowing what I knew at that point

26:21.140 --> 26:25.860
with the experience I had in business. And so what I want to cover last in this next eight minutes

26:25.860 --> 26:33.060
before I get into Q&A is the sweet spot. And if I were to start today, knowing what I know now,

26:33.620 --> 26:37.460
what would I do? Would I go broad? Would I go vertical? Would I do a combination of both?

26:38.020 --> 26:43.540
And yeah, anyway, and this is what I'm going to tell you is I think that there is a sweet spot.

26:44.180 --> 26:49.380
I think that there is, I don't think you should do either. I don't think you should just do

26:49.380 --> 26:55.620
one niche. I think that there's kind of a combination. And the reason why I'm saying

26:55.620 --> 27:03.060
this is because, you know, I just went into tree service and it worked, but luckily tree

27:03.060 --> 27:07.220
service is an industry. I didn't even think about this. Luckily tree service is a service where

27:07.940 --> 27:12.580
heaven forbid you have a tree falling on your house. But if you do, whether the economy is

27:12.580 --> 27:17.940
good or bad, you got to get it taken care of. You just have to. The other thing in 2020 is

27:17.940 --> 27:24.340
unknowingly I went into cities that didn't have extreme weather. Does that make sense? I didn't

27:24.340 --> 27:29.940
go into, you know, Minnesota and North Dakota and all this stuff where my business completely,

27:29.940 --> 27:35.940
you know, changed during the winter. And so I'm trying to just look at this and let you guys know

27:35.940 --> 27:40.340
it wasn't because I was so good. It was because I did a couple of things right. And then I got

27:40.340 --> 27:45.380
lucky on the rest. I went into the right cities unknowingly. And I mean that like in the right

27:45.380 --> 27:51.300
climates. I picked the right niche unknowingly. Imagine if I had picked a niche that was kind of

27:51.300 --> 27:56.820
tied to the economy. Imagine in 2020 I had picked pool installation. By the way, I don't know if you

27:56.820 --> 28:03.140
guys knew this, but like pool installation in 2020, 2021, I think even into 2022, dude, it was

28:03.140 --> 28:11.860
unbelievable. Unbelievable. Fiberglass pools, shotcrete pools, everybody was getting a pool

28:11.860 --> 28:17.380
because guess what? Not only were they getting stimulus checks or whatever, PPE loans, whatever

28:17.380 --> 28:22.020
we were getting, but also the interest rates were so low everyone was taking out a HELOC on their

28:22.020 --> 28:27.780
house and throwing in a pool. Imagine I had built my business on pool installation. Guess what would

28:27.780 --> 28:34.180
have happened by the end of 2022? My business is gone because nobody's putting in pools now. And of

28:34.180 --> 28:40.100
course people are putting in pools. I'm saying relative to what was happening in 2020, nobody

28:40.100 --> 28:44.980
is putting in pools. My entire street, I think out of like the 20 houses, there's two that don't have

28:44.980 --> 28:51.540
pools. It was insane. I couldn't even sleep after like 6 a.m. because we had jackhammers because we

28:51.540 --> 28:56.900
live on like a mountain, like on a rock and they had to drill through the rock. So I want you guys

28:56.900 --> 29:00.980
to understand that it's not black and white. Just because that worked for me in 2020 does not mean

29:00.980 --> 29:05.300
that if you go into tree service today and today is only tree service, it's going to work the exact

29:05.300 --> 29:08.580
same. It's not. So I just have to let you guys know. The other thing is you have to realize there's

29:08.580 --> 29:13.940
unforeseeable things like the economy. I didn't anticipate the economy was going to do what it's

29:14.900 --> 29:18.100
doing right now. And if I would have gone into pools and built my entire business on that,

29:18.100 --> 29:24.820
gosh dang, that would have been tough. So I like the idea of a bit of diversification so that

29:24.820 --> 29:31.940
I can guard myself against unforeseeable things like law changes, economy factors, etc. Again,

29:33.940 --> 29:39.620
these are things I've learned by being in this business for eight years. And also we can kind

29:39.620 --> 29:44.980
of like extract, if you kind of like zoom out a bit and you can relate this to business in general,

29:45.700 --> 29:52.260
right? Because I stuck with one business and I just went in, I've been in one business and

29:52.260 --> 29:56.660
I've been focusing on one business instead of eight. Yes, at times I've got shiny penny syndrome.

29:56.660 --> 30:01.780
I've been able to scale this one business to make millions of dollars and I've got friends that have

30:01.780 --> 30:06.900
eight businesses, 10 businesses, three businesses, four businesses that are making a quarter of what

30:06.900 --> 30:12.740
I'm making even though they've got more businesses, right? So keep in mind that this principle I think

30:12.740 --> 30:17.620
applies as you zoom out as well to business in general, okay? Here's what I would do. If I

30:17.620 --> 30:23.700
was starting today, I would go into, for your first two to three deals, I would go into one niche and

30:23.700 --> 30:28.340
I would make sure that that niche was tried and true, okay? One niche, tried and true. And when

30:28.340 --> 30:33.540
I say one niche of tried and true, it's the ones I always talk about, okay? Concrete, tree service,

30:33.540 --> 30:39.460
spray foam, artificial grass, masonry, fencing, da da da da da. They're tried and true. You know

30:39.460 --> 30:42.660
they're going to work. You know they're going to, once you get leads and you get a good city,

30:42.660 --> 30:46.820
it's going to work. Until you get two to three deals, you should not be changing niches. You

30:46.820 --> 30:51.060
should just go get two or three deals. And the reason I don't just say one is because if you get

30:51.060 --> 30:56.580
one, you may as well get two or three because you've already learned all the keywords for that niche.

30:56.580 --> 31:02.900
You already have learned the lingo and what the good services are, where the money is made,

31:02.900 --> 31:08.260
and you can name drop, and you can use the momentum to get two or three. So my recommendation,

31:08.260 --> 31:12.580
what I would do if I was going today is I'd go one niche for my first two to three deals, okay?

31:12.580 --> 31:20.740
That's step one. And that would be in a tried and true, boring niche. Step two is that I would go

31:20.740 --> 31:26.580
into two to three boring niches. So I might expand out a bit. So, okay, let's say I got three tree

31:26.580 --> 31:31.860
service sites. Now, just to diversify a bit, I might add another boring niche. I'm not going

31:31.860 --> 31:36.340
to go into freaking yacht rentals right out the gate. I'm not going to go into assisted living,

31:36.340 --> 31:39.540
which, by the way, assisted living is terrible. I've never done yacht rentals. I'm just giving

31:39.540 --> 31:45.860
you examples. But if you do want to expand, you could also just stay in one niche and go to 10k,

31:45.860 --> 31:52.020
get out of your job, whatever. But to diversify a bit, what I would do is I would add one or two

31:52.020 --> 31:57.860
niches. I'd have max three boring niches. And I would learn everything about those two to three

31:57.860 --> 32:05.300
niches until I get enough deals to get to 10k. And 10k being representative of the amount of money

32:05.300 --> 32:12.020
to live. Because usually at 10k net, you could pretty much pay your bills. Now, some of you guys

32:12.020 --> 32:15.060
live really lavishly, maybe not. Some of you guys, that's probably way more than you need.

32:15.620 --> 32:19.940
But I would stick in the two to three niches until I hit enough to pay my bills comfortably.

32:20.500 --> 32:24.900
And this is my main thing. Because I'm guessing most of you guys, maybe not all, but most of you

32:24.900 --> 32:28.900
guys are probably still working a job, doing other stuff. Maybe it's another business and

32:28.900 --> 32:32.740
you're trying to make this your main thing. So step one, one niche for your first two to three

32:32.740 --> 32:40.260
deals. Step two, either keep scaling that one niche or diversify into two to three niches tops

32:40.820 --> 32:46.020
until you get out of the rat race, until your bills are paid, until you get to 10k, until you

32:46.020 --> 32:50.900
get to a comfortable number where you're not strapped, where you're not scared. You can quit

32:50.900 --> 32:57.060
your job with confidence. Okay. Step three is I would keep scaling those two to three niches

32:58.340 --> 33:04.900
and I would focus on those two to three niches only. And I would not go and test other niches

33:04.900 --> 33:08.100
because now you've already done the work. You've got the keywords, you know, the lingo, you know,

33:08.100 --> 33:11.380
the rumor, you know, the gossip, you know, the companies, the vendors, everybody uses,

33:11.380 --> 33:15.060
you know, what the conferences are, you know, the good times, you know, the bad times, you know,

33:15.060 --> 33:19.140
when it's slow, you know, when it's hot, you know, when people are spending their money on their tax

33:19.140 --> 33:23.300
dollars on doing the service, you know, everything about these niches, why would you go change?

33:23.300 --> 33:29.460
Okay. I'm not changing. I'm not going out of three, three max is my, if I'm doing this today,

33:29.460 --> 33:37.940
I would not go above three until I get to at least $50,000 a month, at least 50k per month.

33:37.940 --> 33:44.740
And guys, I wouldn't test another niche. Even if I'm making $25,000 a month net and I have the

33:44.740 --> 33:49.300
money to spend, I'm a single person. I don't have bills to pay. I don't got baby mama drama and

33:49.300 --> 33:54.020
child support and all these different things that some of us have to do. I still would stick to what

33:54.020 --> 33:58.900
you know. And the only time I would test a new niche, the only time I would never do it on my

33:58.900 --> 34:04.180
own, I would do it when referrals came in. I've talked about this at length, but as you guys stay

34:04.180 --> 34:07.620
in business, this is another great thing about staying in business is as you guys continue to

34:07.620 --> 34:10.500
do this and you're the leads guy, you're the guy that knows how to get business and get the phone

34:10.500 --> 34:14.900
to ring, you start getting people sending you messages. You start getting your clients that

34:14.900 --> 34:18.100
you're doing a really good job for calling you saying, Hey, my brother's in this business over

34:18.100 --> 34:23.380
here. Can you get him leads? When you get those referrals and those are in different niches,

34:23.380 --> 34:28.900
that's a really good time to test different niches. And so instead of me going, Hey, I'm going to try

34:28.900 --> 34:36.180
a yacht rental. I got a call from, I'll give you an example. I had a client I was doing masonry for

34:36.180 --> 34:42.580
in Phoenix, Arizona. Okay. And it was a sub niche of masonry and we crushed it. They're paying us

34:42.580 --> 34:47.300
like a thousand bucks a month and they let us know, we had no idea. They let us know after a while,

34:47.300 --> 34:52.500
they had this other business called cactus removal. And I remember my sales guy called me. He's like,

34:52.500 --> 34:57.780
Hey, he wants cactus removal, removal leads. And I'm like, what? Who knew that was a business

34:57.780 --> 35:03.060
cactus removal? Literally you go and remove cactuses, right? This is why this, this by the

35:03.060 --> 35:07.060
way, guys, side note, this is why this business is never going to be saturated. Cactus removal,

35:07.860 --> 35:13.700
cactus rule, right? And dude, I never would have even thought of it. A B I would have never spent

35:13.700 --> 35:19.780
my own money to go put up a landing page and run ads. And no, absolutely not. Right. However,

35:20.420 --> 35:26.180
I told my sales guy, I said, okay, well, we have no idea what's going to happen, but you can tell

35:26.180 --> 35:31.860
him that if he wants to run the risk, we're going to do the exact same strategy. We're going to own

35:31.860 --> 35:35.220
the website, the whole deal. He's going to need to help us with images. He's going to need to

35:35.220 --> 35:41.780
help us with an address, all that stuff. And it should work, but we've never done cactus. And

35:41.780 --> 35:45.540
that's the truth. And so, you know, and it's probably going to cost a little bit more because

35:45.540 --> 35:49.700
it looks like, you know, we're going to have to learn the this and that and the rest and our team's

35:49.700 --> 35:53.780
going to have to learn the keywords. And so I basically told my sales guy to quote him high.

35:53.780 --> 35:58.260
And so for the masonry deal, we were making like a thousand bucks a month. And he went back to,

35:58.260 --> 36:03.780
by the way, I remember I was on the golf course. I even remember the golf course. I even remember

36:03.780 --> 36:08.020
the exact hole because my sales guy threw me off when he told me cactus removal. And I was like,

36:08.580 --> 36:13.220
what? Because we were trying to hit a goal as a company. And I was like, you know what,

36:13.220 --> 36:17.620
just give him this offer. And he calls me back by about like the eighth or ninth hole. We were just

36:17.620 --> 36:23.780
finishing the round. And he's like, he said, yes, he's in. And I'm like, dope, let's do it. I'm like,

36:23.780 --> 36:29.140
have the team build it. And guys, the crazy part is, is we took the money up front. We had him pay

36:29.140 --> 36:33.540
for the full first month. It was like 1200 bucks. I think it was. And I could be wrong. So it might

36:33.540 --> 36:38.820
have been 1500. It might've been 1100. I don't know. It was over a thousand. And we took the money. We

36:38.820 --> 36:43.940
used his money to build the website, to buy the domain, to build the content. We used his photos,

36:43.940 --> 36:49.700
all that stuff. He basically did everything for us and we own the property. And guys, that property,

36:49.700 --> 36:55.460
that project crushed it. It absolutely crushed it. We got leads left and right. There was no

36:55.460 --> 37:00.340
competition. We ranked quickly. We didn't have to spend that much on ads. And it was just freaking

37:00.340 --> 37:05.940
gravy. And I had no risk, right? I didn't have to go and do my research on, oh, his practice.

37:06.500 --> 37:12.180
He wanted the leads bad enough that he was willing to give us money up front. And I'm like, yeah,

37:12.180 --> 37:17.700
I'll educate myself on your dime. And I did that because I would have been willing to make

37:17.700 --> 37:22.820
zero dollars to know that that niche was not good. Okay. However, keep in mind, the principle

37:22.820 --> 37:27.460
behind this is I did not seek it out. I did not say, you know, I'm not satisfied with these two to

37:27.460 --> 37:32.340
three niches that are making me all this money. I need to go look at another one. No, I waited until

37:32.340 --> 37:35.940
I got that phone call until my sales guy talked to him enough that he's like, yeah, can you get

37:35.940 --> 37:40.420
me cactus removal leads? And I was like, yeah, same thing. Guys, you want to know how I got into

37:40.420 --> 37:45.780
artificial grass? I didn't go into a new niche. I was still comfortable, man. I was doing concrete.

37:45.780 --> 37:53.540
I was doing tree service. Tree service was in, uh, tree service was in 2020, 2021. I was still

37:53.540 --> 37:58.820
kind of doing tree service. Um, and yeah, still doing, honestly still doing tree service. But at

37:58.820 --> 38:03.540
the beginning of the year, I had somebody come to my house to give me a quote for artificial grass.

38:04.260 --> 38:08.820
And they asked me if they could, if, if I could get them leads, that was the only reason that I

38:08.820 --> 38:14.580
went into it. And it ended up being a phenomenal niche in 2020, 2021. I made a lot of money on

38:14.580 --> 38:19.140
artificial grass, but I didn't go and look for it. That's like being in a relationship you're

38:19.140 --> 38:22.260
super happy with and everything's flowing. You're like, dude, I'm going to, I'm going to go, I need,

38:22.260 --> 38:26.980
I need to go get a side chick or side guy. Like it's stupid, right? You're, you're,

38:26.980 --> 38:33.700
you're self sabotaging, right? That's just my two cents. So step one, one niche to get your first

38:33.700 --> 38:39.380
two or three deals. Step two, you can expand into two or three boring niches, but pick them wisely

38:39.380 --> 38:43.060
and keep them boring. And when I say boring, tried and true, because you know, they're going

38:43.060 --> 38:50.820
to work and learn them and perfect them and be in those, make them everything to you until you get

38:50.820 --> 38:58.100
to at least those two to three. Like I'm sticking in those until I get to 50 K. Okay. And I'm not

38:58.100 --> 39:04.100
going outside of it until somebody approaches me. Okay. And guys, another thing is as you crush it

39:04.100 --> 39:07.460
for your clients, they're going to refer you to people. They're going to want you to get leads

39:07.460 --> 39:10.420
for their other businesses. They're going to want to tell their, they're going to tell their friends,

39:10.420 --> 39:13.700
their family about you. You are going to get deals if you take care of your clients. Okay.

39:14.740 --> 39:21.620
And then lastly, I put this is like, once you guys get to 50 K plus, if you want to go test new

39:21.620 --> 39:26.100
niches for the fun of it, go do it. And I did do a bit of that. Like I went into golf lessons,

39:26.100 --> 39:29.620
I went and got a golf lesson. I was like, I wonder if this would work. And I did golf lessons.

39:30.340 --> 39:34.980
I got leads. It just, it wasn't enough. It wasn't that the margins were that great. The guy wasn't

39:34.980 --> 39:39.860
super hungry. It was just kind of fun. I did assisted living because my brother-in-law was

39:39.860 --> 39:43.300
in assisted living. He's like, Hey, I think we could do this. There was, I think there were

39:43.300 --> 39:46.260
some regulations. We didn't really do much with that. I think I spent like a thousand bucks

39:46.260 --> 39:52.420
testing that out. I tried, what else did I try out? I tried out some interesting stuff

39:53.140 --> 39:58.340
that a lot of it didn't work to be very honest with you. But once you get to 50 K plus, I think,

39:58.340 --> 40:02.580
okay, you're fine. You want to go do some stuff for fun. Great. But still, as I look at that,

40:02.580 --> 40:06.820
I still didn't really make that much money. It's always better when you have a hungry customer

40:06.820 --> 40:11.540
come to you because you already have the customer in the bag. Now you just have to go with the leads.

40:11.540 --> 40:17.220
Okay. So that said guys, that is the sweet spot. That's how I would attack it today.

40:18.340 --> 40:23.060
Now, the thing that we've talked about in previous lives, these Monday lives, we talked about how to

40:23.060 --> 40:27.540
pick the perfect city, which by the way, we're not talking about today because I've covered that

40:27.540 --> 40:32.820
before. But if you don't, you could do all this and you pick the wrong city. You're screwed. You're

40:32.820 --> 40:37.060
screwed. Right. That's what I did. Right. I was going and I didn't know what the right city was.

40:37.060 --> 40:42.820
And I went and built in all kinds of different cities and I wasn't making money. So this business

40:42.820 --> 40:48.340
model, although it's simple, build a website, get leads, whether that's through SEO, whether that's

40:48.340 --> 40:54.020
through ads, get a client and set it and forget it mailbox money. Although it's simple from like

40:54.020 --> 41:00.500
an a 20,000 foot view, there's a lot of nuances. Like guys, we're talking about just the topic of

41:01.220 --> 41:07.140
broad versus vertical today. And I'm just getting warmed up. But for the sake of Q&A,

41:07.140 --> 41:12.820
I want to go into that. So what we're going to do now, guys, is I told Aaron,

41:12.820 --> 41:16.100
because we're going to start doing this for those of you that are on this call and you're like,

41:16.100 --> 41:19.860
like I was when I got into this business, I didn't have time to waste.

41:20.420 --> 41:24.420
I absolutely did not have time to waste. I wasn't interested in trying to piece

41:24.420 --> 41:29.060
all this together. I told Aaron to have the link ready. So Aaron, in the comments, if you want to

41:29.060 --> 41:33.140
drop the link, I'm only saying this because I know that there's going to be that one, two,

41:33.140 --> 41:37.380
three people on this call that are like, Hey, this is great. I want to go fast. I want to get

41:37.380 --> 41:40.900
out of my job. I'm tired of it. I was at that point. And so for those people, if you guys want

41:40.900 --> 41:45.380
to apply, that's the link to digital analysts. You don't have to go find it. I was in the situation.

41:45.380 --> 41:49.940
I'll just let you know this, that I got, I knew I wanted to do this model, but I was probably like

41:49.940 --> 41:55.300
a lot of you guys. I was like, I'm going to do it after I get done doing door to door sales this

41:55.300 --> 42:01.460
summer. That was my goal. That was my plan. I'm going to go make money. Guys, I got to Alabama

42:02.100 --> 42:07.300
and my license to knock doors was expired. It hadn't been approved and I couldn't knock,

42:07.300 --> 42:12.660
like legally couldn't knock. So I had to go with my manager, my co-manager, we co-manage his team.

42:13.380 --> 42:18.820
And I basically had to shadow him. I couldn't even pitch like legally. I was running the risk

42:18.820 --> 42:23.060
of getting in trouble. So I shadowed him the very first day. Didn't make any money. I'm

42:23.060 --> 42:28.180
shadowing this guy. And I remember about two hours in, two hours into my very first day,

42:28.180 --> 42:33.140
I had four or five months ahead of me of knocking door six days a week. I knew I was like, I'm not

42:33.140 --> 42:39.300
going to make it unless I get, unless I get something going right now, I'm not going to

42:39.300 --> 42:43.460
mentally make this for the next four or five months. I'm just not. And that day I went home

42:43.460 --> 42:47.700
and I started watching videos and I started, I'm like, I have to do this. And within a week,

42:47.700 --> 42:52.180
I'd been on a call and I was going through training and I was spending my, I spent my entire summer

42:52.180 --> 42:56.100
knocking doors, doing my job and building websites, learning how to build websites,

42:56.100 --> 43:00.340
learning how to do content and just trying to figure this out. And it sounds exhausting

43:01.300 --> 43:05.860
because I didn't have that much time or energy, but it was so fun because I could not,

43:06.420 --> 43:11.460
I could not even fathom how fun it would be, how exciting it would be to be able to not knock doors

43:11.460 --> 43:16.020
and just make money from my laptop. That, that idea of that drove me so much. I stayed up till

43:16.020 --> 43:21.860
midnight every night and just worked on my stomach, on the floor, on the carpet. After I ate my

43:21.860 --> 43:26.180
chipotle and showered and I was just learning and it was fascinating. I could, I could make money

43:26.180 --> 43:30.740
from my computer. Are you kidding me? So for those of you that are in that situation, Hey,

43:30.740 --> 43:36.660
I'm done with my job or my situation or whatever. There's the link Aaron dropped it. And that said,

43:36.660 --> 43:42.420
guys, let's go through Aaron. I'm going to have you read any of the questions just because I don't

43:42.420 --> 43:48.340
want to distract my mind. Is there any questions that we need to cover? Yeah, for sure. So let me

43:48.340 --> 43:53.540
quickly just say, by the way, Arunava, he's talked, asked if he could have the recording for,

43:53.540 --> 43:57.540
I think he's talking about the previous slide. We're not giving out those recordings. We were

43:57.540 --> 44:02.100
only giving out like a three of max and we've already given out those to people, but we'll

44:02.100 --> 44:07.140
send you the recording for this live Arunava. So you don't need to worry about that, but also

44:07.140 --> 44:12.820
tell him and let everyone know we are going to be doing a giveaway on Friday and we're going to be

44:12.820 --> 44:18.180
giving away the whole stack of the last five lives. And we're going to get to, you know,

44:18.180 --> 44:24.180
we should do, let's do two, let's do two. We're going to give two people the full stack and then

44:24.180 --> 44:29.940
we could even maybe we could give one away just to somebody in this group. So keep an eye out.

44:29.940 --> 44:33.860
If you're not in the free group, we're going to be giving away the last five recordings.

44:33.860 --> 44:38.980
And guys, we're purposely doing this because people aren't taking this like as serious as

44:38.980 --> 44:42.980
we want them to for the amount of time and effort we guys, we literally have full-time

44:42.980 --> 44:46.500
people monitoring that group that are getting paid. Like go find another Facebook group that

44:46.500 --> 44:50.820
has a paid person, multiple paid people monitoring a free group. What do we have? Three people that

44:50.820 --> 44:55.300
are employed full-time by me that are running that group plus me, plus you. I mean, it's insane. So

44:56.500 --> 45:02.180
anyway, keep going. Yeah, for sure. And so Ed said, do you always go for a $1,000 website rental

45:02.180 --> 45:08.980
price tag? Like is the minimum. When I first started, no, I accepted my first, it was like

45:08.980 --> 45:17.380
$600. But ever since I got my first thousand dollars, yeah, it's unless I, I don't even know

45:17.380 --> 45:20.580
last time I did less than a thousand. A thousand is kind of like the starting point. And that's

45:20.580 --> 45:25.060
before this thing inflated. So I would, you guys should not be charging anything less than a thousand.

45:25.060 --> 45:30.260
You're crazy too. And some of you guys are like, well, if you can't fathom charging a thousand,

45:30.260 --> 45:35.700
you're the wrong niche. Right. There's just too many opportunities, like opportunity costs.

45:35.700 --> 45:42.420
A hundred percent. Theo says, what will you do if you had to do Legion only in your state, Utah,

45:42.420 --> 45:49.860
for scale, stay narrow or go wide? Well, I would ask why that, why you, so he's asked, he's from

45:49.860 --> 45:54.580
France, right? Theo, yeah, pretty sure. Okay. So he's basically asking that because he's in France.

45:54.580 --> 45:58.500
He's in France. He wants to target France. Okay. So that's, that's the real question is if I was

45:58.500 --> 46:03.860
going to do it in France. So what I would do is I would just do the same thing. I would go and figure

46:03.860 --> 46:09.540
out like, Hey, how can I go into two to three really? Well, my first, as my advice was go pick

46:09.540 --> 46:14.900
one niche, get your first two to three deals in the one niche. And then from there become the expert

46:14.900 --> 46:20.020
in that and then branch out into two to three niches and go countrywide. Now, if you're just

46:20.020 --> 46:24.340
going to stick in France and I'm guessing because he's thinking there's a language barrier, by the

46:24.340 --> 46:28.660
way, guys, if you think that there's an accent barrier, language barrier, whatever, it's not,

46:28.660 --> 46:33.300
it's not what you think. If you can get them leads up front, you can go into any country in the world

46:33.300 --> 46:40.100
just so you know. But I know what you're asking this. So what I would say is for your situation,

46:40.100 --> 46:43.220
this is why I said it's not black and white. You might have to go into a few more niches

46:43.220 --> 46:47.140
than two to three. You might have to be in five. So that's going to be a little bit challenging

46:47.140 --> 46:50.180
because you're going to have to be the expert of five. But if you're choosing to only stick

46:50.180 --> 46:52.980
into France, then that that might be the case. So that'd be my answer.

46:54.260 --> 46:59.700
Awesome. That makes sense. OK. And then Ed said this might be for another day, but please briefly

46:59.700 --> 47:04.740
touch on picking a city. You've also done a couple of YouTube lives on this that are they are different

47:04.740 --> 47:09.700
from the ones we just did with the zoom lives here. But those are also just other angles at

47:09.700 --> 47:14.420
looking at the diamond that is making a city. Yeah. And I'll give I'll give two or three things.

47:14.420 --> 47:19.300
And then also, again, just as a reminder, as I said before, like even with these two or three

47:19.300 --> 47:23.300
things, each one of these things, I could talk for an hour plus on. So I'm going to get the two

47:23.300 --> 47:26.420
or three things, Ed. But just so you know, this is again, I don't know if you were on at the

47:26.420 --> 47:30.500
beginning when I gave the example of the trainer. It's like the purpose of these lives is to give

47:30.500 --> 47:36.340
you enough to get started. And now you're asking the right questions right now. You're like, OK.

47:36.340 --> 47:40.020
And once you get into this, Aaron, you probably realize this, too, right? It's like when you

47:40.020 --> 47:43.140
hear the concept, like, yeah, that's easy. I remember hearing the first podcast on this.

47:43.140 --> 47:47.620
I'm like, yeah, for sure. And I even went, dude, I even went to Weebly and I was like,

47:47.620 --> 47:52.180
what do I do? And then I was like, how do I get a free? And I got a Google voice number.

47:52.180 --> 47:56.420
And then after I wasted like four hours, I'm like, yeah, let me just get the blueprint. Let

47:56.420 --> 48:00.020
me go find somebody that's teaching this. But like, you don't really know how much you don't

48:00.020 --> 48:03.300
know until you start getting into this. And that's the whole point, guys. I want you to get in.

48:03.300 --> 48:06.820
The first step is the hardest. It's the hardest to put on your gym shoes and get to the freaking gym.

48:07.380 --> 48:11.140
And then you could figure everything else out. So my goal is to inspire you to get started.

48:11.700 --> 48:16.740
And then if you guys want to either spend the next five years at the gym, try to figure

48:16.740 --> 48:20.340
everything out, asking this person, ask that person, watching YouTube video, following this,

48:20.340 --> 48:25.380
following that, doing this, make a mistake, not losing weight. That's cool. That's one way.

48:25.380 --> 48:28.820
Or you can just go to the guy that looks how you want to look or the girl looks how you want to

48:28.820 --> 48:33.220
look, say, hey, what's your what's your feet? Can you just tell me what to eat, what to train,

48:33.220 --> 48:41.860
how to rest? Well, that's it. So that said, guys, city, it has nothing to do with population,

48:42.500 --> 48:49.700
has everything to do with volume, volume versus competition. I typically like to go into the

48:49.700 --> 48:57.140
smallest cities possible with adequate search volume. And the only reason I say that is

48:57.140 --> 49:00.900
typically speaking, the smaller the city, the lower the competition, not always.

49:01.940 --> 49:04.660
Other than that, I stay out of certain states.

49:05.460 --> 49:15.060
If cities near me fit the bill, I love it because heck, I can drive to them. I can drop the fact

49:15.060 --> 49:19.620
that I'm local. I have a local phone number. I also like to look at trends. I like to make sure

49:19.620 --> 49:24.100
like, hey, for example, I'm in Dubai right now. I could tell you right now, for those of you that

49:24.100 --> 49:30.980
want to test out new countries, Dubai is a country. It's not getting less popular. It's only getting

49:30.980 --> 49:39.860
more popular. And there's certain cities in states, Los Angeles is not getting more popular.

49:42.100 --> 49:44.820
People aren't getting more interested in Los Angeles. I'm telling you that right now.

49:45.460 --> 49:52.340
So these are some of the factors from a high overview that I like to look at. We went into

49:52.340 --> 50:01.540
detail that week. Also as a side note, anyone that's on this call that's in Digital Landlords,

50:01.540 --> 50:05.460
this entire library is inside of the training as well. And Aaron, can you make sure that we

50:05.460 --> 50:10.420
let Isaac know to put this library inside of the training? Yeah, for sure. I see Stephanie's answer.

50:10.420 --> 50:13.700
We'll definitely get you taken care of there. What's up, Stephanie? Good to see you, Stephanie.

50:14.820 --> 50:19.140
Any other questions? Yeah, so we got some really good ones. And actually, I'll take a screenshot

50:19.140 --> 50:22.420
for you next so we can address things like if you want to do YouTube videos, but we won't be

50:22.420 --> 50:26.900
able to probably get to them all. Okay. Let's rapid fire for the next three minutes.

50:26.900 --> 50:31.300
Yeah, let's do it. So what is the maximum amount, Theo says, what is the maximum amount

50:31.300 --> 50:38.980
billed per month for a single service for a business owner? Max? I had for a single service

50:38.980 --> 50:44.900
or a single site, because I've charged as much as like $3,000 per month for one single website,

50:44.900 --> 50:51.540
one client. But I've also had clients that they pay me $1,000 to $2,000 per location and I've

50:52.260 --> 50:57.780
expanded and grown them to $30,000 a month. I've done both. So there's no max. It just depends on

50:57.780 --> 51:01.460
the niche. There's a niche called pole barns, I think it's called. I've never done it. It's like

51:01.460 --> 51:04.900
metal buildings or it's like a specific type of metal building. I don't even know what it is. And

51:04.900 --> 51:09.460
we have one of our students that's doing it and he was charging like $5,000 a month retainers

51:09.460 --> 51:16.260
because they're such big jobs. So there's no max. That's the beautiful thing. That's the beautiful

51:16.260 --> 51:19.940
thing. Just be careful you don't sell out of your own wallet. To you, if $5,000 a month seems like

51:19.940 --> 51:25.860
a lot, that doesn't mean it's a lot for everybody. $5,000 a month doesn't scare me because I'd spend

51:25.860 --> 51:31.860
that on one person that's consulting us on one thing inside of our business right now. But to

51:31.860 --> 51:35.380
you, because you're just starting, that might be your entire salary. So don't sell out of your own

51:35.380 --> 51:37.780
wallet. Remember that that's not expensive to everybody. Keep going.

51:38.660 --> 51:43.380
For sure. This one I like super easy from Arunava. He says, for charging $1,000 a month,

51:43.380 --> 51:48.180
that means I need to choose high ticket boring niches. The response would be yes. So like,

51:48.180 --> 51:53.140
okay, like it's, it's easy to get 10 concrete leaves and get like 50 plumbing or towing weights.

51:53.140 --> 51:56.100
Why, why, why, yeah, why, why? Just make it easy.

51:56.820 --> 52:03.700
Yeah. And then also the, I missed this one. Shane says, do you feel that the tried and true niches,

52:03.700 --> 52:07.060
concrete tree service, et cetera, are saturated or will get saturated?

52:08.340 --> 52:11.700
I think that they're more saturated than they were, but I think there's so many deals. Like

52:11.700 --> 52:14.260
I'm going to give you an example. I just made a YouTube video. By the way, if you guys aren't

52:14.260 --> 52:17.460
subscribed to me on YouTube, I do completely different content than I do in my free groups.

52:17.460 --> 52:21.060
It's, and I'm just saying that because I like, I put, I made a YouTube video before I got on this.

52:21.860 --> 52:26.500
I was making a YouTube video showing a niche literally like a couple of days ago.

52:27.380 --> 52:30.900
I was showing Bentonville concrete. In fact, go guys, go look at this video. It's like my last

52:30.900 --> 52:35.140
uploaded video, second to last uploaded video. And I've made $46,000 from this one website.

52:36.260 --> 52:42.420
And as I'm doing the freaking live video, the second person that's ranked is a lead generator.

52:44.340 --> 52:49.700
And instead of being pissed, I was like, cool. Somebody saw my videos, went and did the research

52:49.700 --> 52:54.740
and realized that there's another opportunity to come in, rank a website and go get a client.

52:54.740 --> 53:00.500
So are you going to run into more lead generators? Yes. Is there still deals? Yes. Would I go into,

53:00.500 --> 53:02.900
would I focus solely on concrete after we've talked about it for two years?

53:03.860 --> 53:08.820
I don't know. Maybe, maybe not, but there's masonry, there's artificial grass, there's

53:08.820 --> 53:12.980
duck cleaning, there's freaking pole barns, there's metal buildings. Like I'm breaking down new

53:12.980 --> 53:17.060
niches all the time inside of digital landlords, Aaron. And there's always new stuff that's coming

53:17.060 --> 53:21.940
up that works. So keep going. A hundred percent last comment. This isn't really a question,

53:21.940 --> 53:25.860
but a comment that we can probably wrap it up. But I said, please do a call on getting clients.

53:25.860 --> 53:28.740
So it sounds like really the sales process, specifically the sales call.

53:29.460 --> 53:35.460
Yeah. A hundred percent. That would be that we do. We have a training on that. It's about

53:35.460 --> 53:43.300
four hours worth of training. So it's like, that's, that's, that is the whole problem. That is the,

53:43.300 --> 53:48.020
that is the most important part. And I'm only saying this because a lot of people think

53:49.460 --> 53:52.980
it's two things, picking the right city and niche and getting the client,

53:52.980 --> 53:59.380
all the stuff in between is easy. Get building a website, ranking it on Google, all the stuff that

53:59.380 --> 54:03.220
you think I need to get tech. Dude, that stuff's easy. Aaron, can you back me up on this? Like

54:03.220 --> 54:10.580
that's the stuff. There's a thousand trainings on how to rank a website. Pick a good city and you

54:10.580 --> 54:18.340
don't even have to be that good. That's, that's the truth. You like, that's literally the game,

54:18.340 --> 54:25.060
right? Like you want to go and like make money on a house, go find the house that's completely

54:25.060 --> 54:29.700
marked way under it's undervalued and go sell it for the value. So the value it's actually

54:29.700 --> 54:33.700
worth, that's the easiest way to make money. Like, so if you can pick, figure out a pick a

54:33.700 --> 54:40.740
city and niche properly, and you know, the sales process, that's the whole game. But to let you

54:40.740 --> 54:46.340
know at the sales process is not just call client there. It's very systematic. There's things you

54:46.340 --> 54:50.500
need to say. There's people you need to target. There's strategy behind it. There's certain ways

54:50.500 --> 54:54.820
to pass over the leads. There's scripts that, yeah, you don't have to know it. You can, you

54:54.820 --> 54:59.300
could stumble your way to a deal, but that's why I do what I do. That's why we, we built what we

54:59.300 --> 55:06.020
built. And so we'll get to that, but it's probably going to be in like Q3 of next year, or maybe it's

55:06.020 --> 55:11.940
Q1 of next year. I don't know. Again, the whole purpose of this is to get you guys to take your

55:11.940 --> 55:16.820
first step, but I love the questions. Ed's got good questions. Ed has really good questions. I,

55:16.820 --> 55:22.740
is Ed in Digital Landlords? I'm trying to remember. He's not. I definitely know he's not in the

55:22.740 --> 55:28.500
Facebook group. I'm just giving you a hard time, bro. I love your questions. They're, they're,

55:28.500 --> 55:32.740
they're great questions. They're all the questions you should be asking. It's why I'm curious. So

55:32.740 --> 55:37.060
is there anything else? Maybe we could do one or two more. Yeah. So Ed also does say,

55:37.060 --> 55:42.900
have you done revenue share? No. Why would I do revenue share? So I can, so that there's like,

55:42.900 --> 55:47.220
if I could do flat fee, why would I do revenue share? Yeah. It seems like with revenue share,

55:47.220 --> 55:51.140
like the only way it works is if you have like a super quality business owner who's good at their

55:51.140 --> 55:55.060
job and there's also honest. And the only problem with that is it's not a way to scale because you

55:55.060 --> 55:58.740
can't learn that until you've worked with them for a while. The only time I'm doing revenue share is

55:58.740 --> 56:04.260
if it's a family member or a friend that I'm doing it as a favor or as a bigger move. That's

56:04.260 --> 56:08.100
the only way I'd never do revenue share. I'll never do commission and I'll never do paper lead

56:08.100 --> 56:14.980
again because why, why, why, if it takes five extra seconds, then why I want, if you guys,

56:14.980 --> 56:18.740
by the way, follow me on Instagram. Lately, I've been showing my Stripe account. I just did today.

56:20.020 --> 56:24.340
I love waking up and seeing at five 35 this morning. I made 150 bucks. It's not a lot,

56:24.340 --> 56:30.180
but you know what? I made 150 bucks while I was on sleepy time. That's sexy to me. I love that. I

56:30.180 --> 56:34.180
don't care if it's $5. I didn't have to work for that. It was done. It was time. Just do one more

56:34.180 --> 56:41.540
more. Yeah. Awesome. I think I'm looking through these. I think that is actually it. I hope I'm

56:41.540 --> 56:46.180
not missing a comment. We did it, dude. We did it. Beautiful. That was good. That was beautiful.

56:46.180 --> 56:49.540
Okay. So what we're going to do guys, thank you guys for being on the call. Once again, Aaron,

56:49.540 --> 56:54.020
real quick, go ahead and drop that link one more time for digital landlords. I have no shame in

56:54.020 --> 56:58.100
doing that only because I, I want you guys to understand this is just like with your business

56:58.100 --> 57:01.940
owners. If you're going to give them free leads, the reason you're doing, you're giving them free

57:01.940 --> 57:05.780
leads is to ultimately lead them to working with you. I'm, I'm on this call because I want to work

57:05.780 --> 57:10.740
with you guys. Like I'm not here to pretend that like this is some kind of like volunteer service.

57:10.740 --> 57:17.540
I make money. I like money. You should too. We can all make money and that's great. I am giving you

57:17.540 --> 57:21.780
this live training because I want to earn your business and you might have to get on a couple

57:21.780 --> 57:26.900
of these before you realize, Hey, I'm just, I'm just kicking the can down the road. But for those

57:26.900 --> 57:31.700
of you that value your time, like I did, or they're in a situation that need to get going,

57:31.700 --> 57:35.460
get serious about life and freaking start making some money and realize that like you can wake up

57:35.460 --> 57:38.660
tomorrow and get hit by a freaking bus and your family's not taken care of and you need to leave

57:38.660 --> 57:44.980
them assets. There you go. So Aaron, drop that one more time. Everyone that was on this call,

57:44.980 --> 57:49.220
that kept their camera on, you guys are going to get a message from Donnie. Is it going to be Donnie

57:49.220 --> 57:53.300
Dre? Yeah, it's going to be Donnie. Donnie Dre is going to reach out, give you our digital resource.

57:53.300 --> 57:58.260
And if I were you guys, I'd keep a little folder, nicely tucked folder. And we're going to keep

57:58.260 --> 58:02.500
giving you guys as incredible value. And the last thing I want to say is I wrap this up guys,

58:02.500 --> 58:07.860
look at what I'm doing on this call and do it for your clients. Go and give the business owners,

58:07.860 --> 58:13.940
you're trying to earn their business so much value. Guys, I guarantee that you could go,

58:13.940 --> 58:17.700
like what I gave you today is 10 times better than what you're going to get from a Udemy course that

58:17.700 --> 58:21.060
you would have spent 50 bucks on or a hundred bucks on or what, I don't even know what it is.

58:21.060 --> 58:27.060
I don't, I've never bought any of that stuff. I promise you the experience I have and the value

58:27.060 --> 58:32.580
I gave you and including this digital resource, you got more value than you would have from paid

58:32.580 --> 58:37.940
stuff. Go do that for your business owners and they will come to you. They will want to work

58:37.940 --> 58:42.020
with you and they will want to stay working with you and grow with you. And that's how you become

58:42.020 --> 58:47.300
a millionaire in this business. So that said, Aaron, anything else? No, that's good. Okay,

58:47.300 --> 58:49.380
I'm out. See you guys next week. Bye.
