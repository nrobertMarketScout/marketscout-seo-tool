00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
Hey everybody, Jeff here. We're doing some filming here to set up the new Google Ads.

00:05.520 --> 00:09.760
We're going to be doing search campaigns for now on. We're going to be setting this up to be a

00:09.760 --> 00:14.640
website search with a call-out option. That's going to be the one that's going to give you the most

00:14.640 --> 00:20.000
utility for most of your lead gens. Maybe at a future date we'll set up a call-only ad for

00:20.000 --> 00:25.520
specific reasons, but today we're going to do website traffic with a call-out asset added.

00:26.480 --> 00:32.960
With that, we're going to go ahead and begin here. So I fold up my MCC here. We were going to set up

00:32.960 --> 00:38.720
a new sub-account. You can see right here in sub-account. So when we pull up our MCC, we go down

00:38.720 --> 00:45.040
here to settings, okay, and we pop that tab down right here and you can follow down along. It says

00:45.040 --> 00:50.720
sub-account settings. You can see the sub-accounts right here and then I click the plus sign right

00:50.720 --> 00:57.680
here and I go to create new account. Okay, so today for the training purposes, we're going to

00:57.680 --> 01:02.560
go through, to follow along with the training, we're going to do Bentonville Concrete today.

01:02.560 --> 01:11.120
So we're going to go ahead and set up an ad for Nick's Bentonville Concrete site. So I go here and

01:11.120 --> 01:15.600
I set this up. I say Google Ads account. It's going to give you these two options. You want to choose

01:15.600 --> 01:21.680
Google Ads account. We go down here and so for Arkansas, I want to choose their time. I believe

01:21.680 --> 01:29.600
they're closer to Chicago time and currency. There you go and that's it. Click here

01:31.440 --> 01:36.560
and confirm you're not a robot and save and continue. That would be the first step in setting

01:36.560 --> 01:44.080
this up. This is going to ask me to confirm it's you. Sometimes they do that and there you go.

01:44.160 --> 01:48.320
Looks like that was good to go. We'll go ahead and do that again. If that happens to you,

01:48.320 --> 01:53.120
sometimes it just sends it to like your YouTube or to your Gmail. Not really a big issue.

01:59.440 --> 02:04.720
Okay, so we have these things set here. This is your payment profile. You should already have this

02:04.720 --> 02:10.400
set up. We've set that up for you in the training. If not, you can go up here to tools and training

02:10.560 --> 02:14.400
or tools and settings and there is a billing area right here where you can

02:14.960 --> 02:20.480
set that up under settings. I'm going to hit submit.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.920
Okay, so with that, now it's going to bring me back into my sub accounts here.

02:34.800 --> 02:39.120
You can see them right here and here is our new one Bentonville Concrete. We're going to click here

02:41.360 --> 02:46.640
and it's going to it's thinking and it's going to come up and it's going to we're going to start

02:46.640 --> 02:56.560
setting up our campaign. Okay, so it wants us to set up our new campaign right here. You can either

02:56.560 --> 03:01.680
click the button right here that says new campaign or you can go down here to set up a campaign.

03:01.680 --> 03:06.480
So I'm going to click right here and set up a campaign and then a lot of this should look

03:06.480 --> 03:09.520
familiar with the initial training for the students that have been here for a little bit,

03:09.520 --> 03:12.880
but if you're new, this is fine. This is just the new one that you're going to be getting.

03:13.760 --> 03:19.120
For today's ad, we're going to be doing a website traffic ad with the call out added. So we're going

03:19.120 --> 03:24.320
to click right here to website traffic and then here it's going to give us the different types

03:24.320 --> 03:29.440
of campaigns. You can see all the ones that Google wants to give you or at least for options.

03:29.440 --> 03:33.920
Google wants to give you or at least for options, we're going to select search.

03:35.360 --> 03:40.720
Okay, and then we're going to do our website. So our website today is going to be Nick's

03:40.720 --> 03:44.560
Bentonville Concrete. You guys should all be familiar with that through the training.

03:44.560 --> 03:49.920
I think in the second version of training, we'll use Queen Creek Concrete, but these are the these

03:49.920 --> 03:55.920
are going to be the same things. When it asks for your conversion goal, I just like to keep it simple

03:55.920 --> 04:01.600
and do a page view. You don't need to set up conversion tracking at this point. This is fine.

04:01.600 --> 04:06.240
So then it's going to ask you to name it. You can you can create whatever name you want.

04:06.240 --> 04:19.600
I'm just going to do search ad Bentonville Concrete. Okay, when you go here, it's going to ask

04:19.600 --> 04:23.680
on to turn on enhanced conversions. You can do that if you want. I don't because I don't like

04:23.680 --> 04:27.840
to share everything with Google, but that's there's nothing wrong with leaving that selected

04:27.840 --> 04:37.360
there. Okay, and then we're going to go to our next screen. Okay, so the next step in setting

04:37.360 --> 04:42.640
this up, it's going to take you to the bidding, right. And so for bidding, its default is

04:42.640 --> 04:49.200
conversions. I recommend and would tell you guys to go and do clicks rather than conversions.

04:49.920 --> 04:55.840
When you start out a new campaign and you do conversions, it will Google will spend all of

04:55.840 --> 05:00.640
your ad budget and sometimes up to three times your daily ad budget. So you want to start with

05:00.640 --> 05:06.240
max clicks, especially for the first three or four months of an ad. So we're going to go here,

05:06.240 --> 05:12.000
we're going to select clicks. Now the next step it's going to do is it's going to ask you

05:12.960 --> 05:19.120
to set a maximum cost per click bid limit. You can see right here, it starts off as a default

05:19.120 --> 05:22.560
where it doesn't ask you that. But while we're setting this up, we're going to go ahead and

05:22.560 --> 05:26.720
we're going to click set right here. Okay. Now at this point, some of you are going to say, well,

05:26.720 --> 05:30.160
I don't know what it is. And that's fine. So we're going to go to the next step,

05:30.160 --> 05:36.640
which is using Google Keyword Planner to help set those CPCs. So with that, I want to show you guys,

05:36.720 --> 05:42.560
some of you are using SEMrush. You can see here that I use Mangles. They're both great tools.

05:42.560 --> 05:47.760
There's not really a huge difference between them. It's just that I use Ahrefs for a lot of

05:47.760 --> 05:54.000
my SEO stuff and it doesn't work great for our local SEO. For Mangles, it's just a cheaper plan

05:54.000 --> 06:00.400
and I like using it. It also gives me the ability to more easily search over certain cities for

06:00.480 --> 06:07.120
keywords. So I go here. I type in my main keyword is concrete contractors over Bentonville. I get

06:07.120 --> 06:11.360
good search volume and as you can see here, there's no CPC. But I'm not really worried about that

06:11.360 --> 06:16.400
because I know that there are people running ads there. But it just gives me some seed words and

06:16.400 --> 06:22.560
some other things to look at. Okay. From there, what I do is I get my main keywords. So we're

06:22.560 --> 06:27.040
doing concrete contractors. We kind of know what those keywords are. But if you were running

06:27.120 --> 06:34.160
artificial grass or spray foam or something like that, you want to have your base list of keywords.

06:34.160 --> 06:39.440
And that's important in your initial keyword research with SEMrush or Mangles.

06:39.440 --> 06:45.120
And I'm going to show you why that's important here. So we're back to our ad. We're going to

06:45.120 --> 06:49.760
use Google Keyword Planner. Now, I don't want to lose my progress right here. So I'm going to go

06:49.760 --> 06:55.600
to Tools and Settings. I'm going to click the wrench right here. You go all the way to the left

06:55.600 --> 07:00.640
in the planning column. You go down to Keyword Planner. You want to right click and you want to

07:00.640 --> 07:08.480
say open link and new tab. And you can see up here that it's open that right here. Okay. So I'm going

07:08.480 --> 07:14.080
to say I want to you can see right here. It's got an active account. Okay. I'm going to click there

07:14.080 --> 07:19.200
and it's going to ask me for what keywords I want to use. So for keywords that I want to use,

07:19.200 --> 07:30.560
it's going to be concrete contractor. It's going to be concrete driveway, concrete patio.

07:32.720 --> 07:39.520
We'll experiment with concrete company as well. Okay. So we're going to run those four keywords

07:39.520 --> 07:43.920
for right now. You can run like four to six in here. It's not a huge thing. And then right here

07:43.920 --> 07:47.840
where it's always going to have a default of whatever home country you're in. But right here

07:47.840 --> 07:51.680
with the little old Google Maps sign, you want to click on where it says the United States.

07:52.880 --> 07:56.720
And what we're going to do is we're going to deselect that and then we're going to choose

07:56.720 --> 08:02.320
our location to target. Okay. Now this is not necessarily going to be our

08:05.520 --> 08:10.800
this isn't necessarily going to be our main place to set up where we're going to run our ads at.

08:10.800 --> 08:15.520
We'll get to that in a different step. This is just to set up and get an idea of what

08:15.520 --> 08:20.880
the CPC will be for running ads over that location. So they're related but they're

08:20.880 --> 08:24.960
separate things. So you can see here I have it selected. It's running it over Bentonville.

08:25.760 --> 08:30.560
I could add other locations but it's really not important at this phase. We're just doing research

08:30.560 --> 08:38.720
on CPC here. We go down to here and I say get results. Okay.

08:39.360 --> 08:44.960
And here we go. So it's going to give us our our stuff here.

08:47.520 --> 08:54.400
And this is interesting. We are getting no CPC here. Very interesting. Very limited CPC

08:54.400 --> 09:01.200
for Bentonville, Arkansas. Okay. So sometimes that's going to happen. When we have here we

09:01.200 --> 09:06.720
have concrete contractor, concrete driveway, concrete patio, concrete company, concrete

09:06.800 --> 09:12.640
patio, concrete company and then you have the added near me. We'll talk about this when we

09:12.640 --> 09:18.240
set up our keywords later. Concrete repair. So there's a little bit of search volume but not a lot

09:19.600 --> 09:23.840
which is interesting. I think you guys on Simrush are getting a lot more than what I'm seeing here

09:23.840 --> 09:32.720
right now. But we can see that in concrete there's near me. You can see a low bid and you can see the

09:32.720 --> 09:38.400
top of page high bid. Okay. So when you set up your main keywords you want to kind of scroll

09:38.400 --> 09:44.080
through this column and you want to pick up your top of page range for your CPC.

09:47.760 --> 09:53.680
And this in this case the top of page bid for the one keyword will be $11.45 which I know is higher

09:53.680 --> 09:58.480
than what we recommend in the training but when you're running search campaigns you have the

09:58.480 --> 10:04.480
ability to be more of a ninja and getting your ad displayed when people do different search queries.

10:04.480 --> 10:10.160
So what we want to do is we want to go back to our campaign here and we're going to set that maximum

10:10.960 --> 10:17.280
CPC limit. I like to do one penny ahead of what I see is the highest limit.

10:18.560 --> 10:25.520
With that we will do another additional live at one point where we will discuss what to do when

10:25.520 --> 10:32.320
you have a lot of variations between the top of page high bid. Okay so once I do that I'm going to

10:32.320 --> 10:39.360
hit next. Okay guys so after we set our our CPC limit we go to this next phase which is the campaign

10:39.360 --> 10:46.480
settings. This is a really simple thing but it also can be a little confusing and if you go through

10:46.480 --> 10:50.800
too fast with this you can make a simple mistake. So we want to be just on the search network.

10:50.800 --> 10:55.920
We can see right here Google auto fills these two blue check marks and one is for search partners.

10:55.920 --> 11:00.000
We don't want to do that so we deselect that and the other one is their display network so we

11:00.000 --> 11:06.720
deselect that. Now our ad is only going to run on the search network. Okay all right and now the

11:06.720 --> 11:12.480
default location is always going to be the world. Okay so we we're going to hit enter another location

11:13.440 --> 11:18.320
okay and then we're going to start typing in. You can either type in a city or in this case

11:18.320 --> 11:23.840
because I'm familiar with Bentonville and how the how it's kind of that city's laid out.

11:24.880 --> 11:32.240
We're going to do like a 15 mile radius and we're going to type in Bentonville Arkansas and we're

11:32.240 --> 11:37.200
going to do a 15 mile radius. Okay and that's going to give us this really big area right here

11:37.200 --> 11:42.240
and that's about what we're going to do for this ad setup. Okay now sometimes if there's a lot of

11:42.240 --> 11:48.320
bigger cities around here you and this city is like 170 and just by doing this all of a sudden

11:48.320 --> 11:53.600
now my ad's running to three or four or five hundred thousand people a 20 or 25 dollar a day

11:53.600 --> 11:58.480
budget isn't going to do well. So you just have to make sure that you do your research on the not

11:58.480 --> 12:03.200
only your keywords and your niche but also when you're setting up your ad. If this was a large

12:03.200 --> 12:08.880
city with a lot of suburbs around it I would just do that city and that city only and you do that

12:08.880 --> 12:13.840
right here by going into the location and you just type in that city and that's where you run it and

12:13.840 --> 12:19.280
you'll see it on the map. Okay and to show an example of that we'll just do that right now we'll

12:19.280 --> 12:23.360
just show you guys what that looks like that way if you're having that issue. So right here I'm

12:23.360 --> 12:27.600
going to say I just want to go over the location and I hit target and you can see it just outlines

12:27.600 --> 12:31.920
the city limits of Bentonville. Okay and then now here if I wanted to add in these other towns I

12:31.920 --> 12:40.000
could definitely do that I can add in Bella Vista Arkansas it's right here right I can add that in

12:40.000 --> 12:45.360
too if I want to do that okay but for simplicity we're just going to do a radius because I know

12:45.360 --> 12:52.080
that's going to work here. Okay so we're going to do this we're going to change that to 15 miles

12:52.080 --> 13:02.880
and we're going to hit target. Okay so now we're back to there you can see the radius and now we're

13:02.880 --> 13:09.200
going to hit save. Okay before we do anything else you want to go to location options right here

13:09.200 --> 13:13.520
you're going to drop that down for the type of services that we're going to be focusing on for

13:14.240 --> 13:21.200
lead gen we want to be presence and people in or regularly in your targeted locations okay

13:22.320 --> 13:28.240
all right languages and typically in a default to english and keywords we'll get to there and

13:28.240 --> 13:32.800
in more settings right here there's really nothing here this is where you can set up an

13:32.800 --> 13:36.960
ad schedule if you want to set it up but typically in the very beginning we don't really do that we

13:36.960 --> 13:41.600
don't really need to do that but you can get in here and set your ad schedule up later on

13:41.600 --> 13:47.920
okay it's really simple you just hit the pencil button it'll give you the times all right we're

13:47.920 --> 13:55.680
going to go to next okay so so now we're going to set up our keywords okay and this is going to

13:55.680 --> 14:08.720
be at the ad group level okay so we're going to do and you can name these whatever you want but

14:08.720 --> 14:13.680
this is just for me to keep track of this here's the website right here and you can see that they

14:13.680 --> 14:22.160
wanted to give me a list of different keywords that they found okay i'm going to go up here

14:23.280 --> 14:27.920
and you can see at the top of my screen here there's a website called adwordsrapper.com

14:28.560 --> 14:35.040
okay it's free i don't think they try to sell your info or anything like that but what it does is it

14:35.040 --> 14:39.680
help you format your your keywords you can see here if you want to read it you can see the different

14:39.680 --> 14:46.080
types of keywords that are out there and there's different there's different quotes and and brackets

14:46.080 --> 14:51.040
and other things to add and they all mean something when you load it into right here to your keyword

14:51.040 --> 14:58.960
thing okay so we want to go here and we're going to add we're going to add our keywords so we go

14:58.960 --> 15:06.080
here now our keywords are going to be concrete contractor okay we're going to do concrete

15:10.480 --> 15:18.400
we're going to do concrete patio we're going to do let's see here we'll go back up to here

15:28.560 --> 15:32.480
sorry i had to go back and get my thing so let me let me pull up some of the ones that

15:32.480 --> 15:36.960
google's recommending right i can use some of these the near me you don't need to worry about

15:37.920 --> 15:40.640
but maybe concrete repair will be one i want to use

15:44.800 --> 15:48.560
okay and then another place besides google keyword planner to get ideas

15:49.360 --> 15:53.360
is you can also go into your main goals or your simrush and you can look at the top

15:53.360 --> 15:58.320
ones that you see here so we're going to do a concrete company we're going to type that in right

15:58.320 --> 16:06.080
here and i'm also going to make that in plural

16:13.520 --> 16:16.800
concrete pouring that might be one you want to look at so we'll look at that

16:17.840 --> 16:23.040
concrete patio concrete driveway remember foundation and concrete pouring are different

16:23.040 --> 16:28.320
okay they're going to be a different type of service then we can do residential and commercial

16:40.800 --> 16:46.160
okay and once we have that again on these you can run eight to fifteen keywords just depends

16:46.160 --> 16:52.560
on what you have and then you you get them to here i hit wrap keywords and then you see

16:52.560 --> 16:55.760
it kind of refresh and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to scroll down here

16:56.400 --> 17:02.960
and i'm looking at this box right here that says phrase match for whatever reason if you click this

17:02.960 --> 17:08.320
button here it doesn't it doesn't want to copy it so i click inside the box here i select all

17:08.320 --> 17:15.200
i copy and i go back to my search campaign where it says enter keywords i select all

17:16.000 --> 17:20.720
i get rid of those and i add my own you can see the quotation so now i'm set up to run

17:20.720 --> 17:22.240
a phrase match campaign

17:24.800 --> 17:32.480
okay and now what we're going to do is now we're going to set up our headlines and we're going to

17:32.480 --> 17:40.720
set up our descriptions okay this is going to be pretty much the same as the original training

17:41.680 --> 17:48.400
but with the search campaign i get to add a lot more headlines and up to four different descriptions

17:48.400 --> 17:54.080
okay so what i'm going to do just for time sake when you guys are learning this and setting this

17:54.080 --> 17:58.880
up i'm just going to set up like three or four headlines and just two descriptions for you

18:00.160 --> 18:05.440
these these are examples so please don't think that these are what i'm using or are the best ones the

18:05.440 --> 18:09.920
best ones that you start out with always take what we got in the training and i always use those

18:09.920 --> 18:15.120
headlines and those descriptions as my first few examples and then after that i start adding in

18:15.360 --> 18:24.080
um of of my main keywords and and variants of that okay so here i'm going to do

18:34.320 --> 18:36.080
my main keyword if i can fit it

18:38.880 --> 18:40.400
okay almost there

18:45.360 --> 18:47.040
so i'm going to do is i'm going to go here

18:52.320 --> 19:00.000
best concrete contractors okay all right and then bentonville concrete i'm going to put experts

19:05.200 --> 19:11.120
call now for your free let's see if we can get code in there perfect

19:11.120 --> 19:16.160
okay we have concrete contractors we have that and what you'll see is up here you guys see that

19:16.160 --> 19:22.080
it'll sometimes it'll want to give you ideas and it'll help you get more of your keywords that you

19:22.080 --> 19:27.120
put in into your into your headlines and what we're trying to do is we're trying to get this

19:27.920 --> 19:33.520
ad strength indicator we want to get it to good or excellent that's where we want to go and

19:33.520 --> 19:38.560
sometimes it just takes a little bit of working back and forth to get there okay so we have

19:39.200 --> 19:44.720
okay so we have concrete contractors again we have that

19:49.200 --> 19:50.320
so we're going to go here

20:01.360 --> 20:05.440
okay so we're going to go with those for now again you want to you want to keep adding these

20:05.440 --> 20:11.920
headlines and you want to make it's giving me stuff here like if i click here i can just copy this

20:16.240 --> 20:19.200
all right and i can paste that right here

20:31.360 --> 20:33.200
almost

20:35.760 --> 20:39.600
okay so we're going to go with that you can see the ad string starting to move so as i add these

20:39.600 --> 20:46.400
headlines in right it's going to keep getting up to good and or to excellent okay all right and

20:46.400 --> 20:53.200
then with the descriptions we're going to do i'm just going to stick with two of them for right now

20:53.200 --> 21:01.200
and again i recommend that we just do what's in the script in the training okay and then you can

21:01.280 --> 21:06.400
add sometimes it'll give you something to kind of work with here i typically don't use the

21:08.000 --> 21:11.840
the suggested ones that google's trying to give you for the descriptions okay but you want to

21:11.840 --> 21:16.160
take what we learned in the training that's in there in the digital steroids file and you

21:16.160 --> 21:20.240
just copy and paste it in here and then you can just tweak it in the next two you can only add

21:20.240 --> 21:27.760
four okay and then from here we're going to go down and for those of you that understand or learn

21:27.760 --> 21:32.080
a little bit more about google ads there's site links and callouts we don't need to worry about

21:32.080 --> 21:37.280
that right now maybe in the future we'll do some special videos to kind of get into that so do not

21:37.280 --> 21:42.160
worry about those right now okay and then we're going to get into more asset types we're going

21:42.160 --> 21:46.720
to go down and this is where we're going to add the callout feature this is adding the callout

21:46.720 --> 21:52.560
feature to your website search campaign we're going to hit the plus calls it's going to ask

21:52.560 --> 22:00.560
for our phone number okay we're going to go here we're going to highlight that number we're going

22:00.560 --> 22:12.240
to copy that and then we are going to paste that number in there okay now with this there are this

22:12.240 --> 22:17.600
is where like if you maybe don't want your client getting calls throughout the night or super early

22:17.600 --> 22:23.440
this is where you can set just this feature up so it says advanced options you can go here and

22:23.440 --> 22:29.840
let's say your business owner starts the day at like seven like eight a.m. so maybe i'll turn the

22:29.840 --> 22:35.920
ads on at seven the call this is just for the call only part of the ad i'll turn them on from seven

22:35.920 --> 22:41.440
thirty and let's say they stop the day at like six o'clock so i'll let them run to like seven

22:41.440 --> 22:51.040
okay and then you hit save okay so that added the callout and then we go here to apply

22:52.320 --> 22:58.240
now we go back to this is again where we're setting up our ads okay this is a big step this

22:58.240 --> 23:06.160
is setting up the keywords and then you roll into the ads here okay we're going to go down to here

23:06.160 --> 23:12.640
and and that's about it from here we're going to hit next and that's going to take us to our

23:14.000 --> 23:19.360
budget okay now this is where some of you are going to kind of gasp a little bit and that's

23:19.360 --> 23:27.840
okay google will auto suggest things for you you can see here it's funny when when you watch the

23:27.840 --> 23:32.160
original recording of this video you'll see that google keyword planner did not give me

23:32.880 --> 23:39.680
um much cpc options but here i am at the budget portion and it's recommending a month a daily

23:39.680 --> 23:47.840
budget of 278 a day and it's telling me my cpc is 949 okay so there obviously are ads running

23:47.840 --> 23:52.640
there obviously a cpc for whatever reason when we did this right now it just didn't want to pull up

23:52.640 --> 23:57.040
the cpc details what i'm going to do is i'm going to set up a custom budget

23:57.360 --> 24:02.560
so it wants to recommend right it's going to tell me that if i ran 222 dollars a day

24:02.560 --> 24:08.080
i'm going to get 190 clicks a week and it cost me 1500 dollars a month that may not be terrible

24:08.080 --> 24:11.760
if you have someone paying you a lot of money but as we're starting this out what we're going to do

24:11.760 --> 24:16.480
is we're going to set this up we're going to try about 25 dollars a day and we're going to see what

24:17.440 --> 24:18.320
google tells me

24:23.440 --> 24:30.800
so at this rate at 25 dollars a day it's telling me that i'm going to get about 69 clicks my cpc

24:30.800 --> 24:38.240
is going to be a lot lower and this is going to be my weekly cost okay now we we have the ability

24:38.240 --> 24:42.400
to go in here and adjust this but this is a good starting point because we're going to get some

24:42.400 --> 24:47.120
data on the clicks and the search terms that we're winning and the ones maybe that we don't want

24:47.120 --> 24:52.320
and i'll be a separate video and we set up our budget here and then we hit next

24:55.600 --> 24:58.480
and now it's checking for errors

25:02.880 --> 25:07.520
okay guys so after we set up our budget we're going to go ahead and it's going to kick us into

25:07.520 --> 25:11.680
the review page here and all we want to do is before we hit publish we just want to make sure

25:11.680 --> 25:16.160
that we set up everything i know in the beginning i talked about making sure that you didn't

25:16.160 --> 25:21.840
accidentally have your display ads or search partner ads click this is the place to catch that

25:21.840 --> 25:26.320
make sure that your objective is right and i'll show you right here so we want to make sure that

25:26.320 --> 25:30.800
our campaign name is what we want it to be so that we understand what it is later when we look back

25:30.800 --> 25:37.120
through this we want to make sure that it is a search campaign okay our main objective for this

25:37.200 --> 25:43.760
is going to be a website traffic ad okay our main goal is going to be page views

25:45.200 --> 25:50.560
and then our bidding we want to do maximize clicks google is always going to want to do

25:50.560 --> 25:55.840
it's going to set up a default of conversions i advise against doing that especially in the

25:55.840 --> 26:00.560
beginning it's not a bad tactic after three or four months of data but in the beginning you

26:00.560 --> 26:05.520
want to have maximize clicks we go here review our we review our networks google search network

26:05.520 --> 26:09.840
that's where we want to be this is where you'll see if you accidentally left that blue check

26:09.840 --> 26:13.920
mark on for the display network or search partner you'll see that here this is the place to go and

26:13.920 --> 26:18.960
you want to go back into your settings and change that okay make sure that your location is where

26:18.960 --> 26:23.520
you want it that it's either in a setup as a radius or as i demonstrated it can set up in

26:23.520 --> 26:28.640
individual cities make sure that they're all here and that that's going the going to fire at the

26:28.640 --> 26:34.400
location you want at the fire app we used about eight keywords that's fine again i recommend

26:34.400 --> 26:40.000
eight to 15 for these you know if you have just three or four solid ones there's nothing wrong

26:40.000 --> 26:45.760
with that if you have 17 18 19 and they're all very related and you have data to support that

26:45.760 --> 26:51.600
that's okay too but just just for recommendations eight to 15 you're in a goods place okay the

26:51.600 --> 26:59.120
budget is 25 a day and from there we hit publish campaign and just as a reminder the first two days

26:59.120 --> 27:03.600
are going to be what google calls a policy review and then just checking to make sure that there's

27:03.600 --> 27:08.320
nothing spammy or fishy going on and then after that you have a five day period which they call

27:08.320 --> 27:14.240
their learning strategy so the first seven days of your new google ad campaign takes some time

27:14.240 --> 27:20.560
so the data and the results are not optimal so do not stress about it do not worry about it too much

27:21.200 --> 27:24.960
that's part of the reason like even in the beginning when we were doing smart campaigns

27:24.960 --> 27:29.840
that's why we recommended not really messing with your ads for the first 14 days i would double that

27:30.560 --> 27:32.800
emphasis for the search campaigns as well

27:34.240 --> 27:37.920
and with that good luck and let us know if you have any questions
