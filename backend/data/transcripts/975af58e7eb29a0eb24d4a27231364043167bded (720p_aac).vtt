WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.380
So Aaron asked the question again, real quick, by the way, hold on who I heard you say somebody's

00:06.380 --> 00:13.180
new who you mentioned that was new Daniel true Daniel welcome to the call.

00:13.180 --> 00:17.280
You're in for a treat and I know Aaron real quick we can make a plug.

00:17.280 --> 00:25.400
We are like, we have committed to quadrupling down on the value and I've said this for about

00:25.400 --> 00:29.640
a month, maybe a little bit longer but yeah there's going to be a lot of.

00:29.640 --> 00:35.120
For those of you that have been around a while, you guys are going to see a huge uptick in.

00:35.120 --> 00:42.560
I don't know if I'd say service or just raw value that we're going to be giving you guys

00:42.560 --> 00:47.800
and so we're talking about this almost every day so anyway, Daniel welcome to call anyone

00:47.800 --> 00:51.600
else that's brand new on this I'm going to try to pull Facebook here I'm going to log

00:51.600 --> 00:56.280
in while Francesca answer this question but welcome to this call.

00:56.280 --> 01:01.040
The purpose is with this is to give you guys, you know, everything that we you need to know

01:01.040 --> 01:03.960
is in the training you could go through the training that could be training.

01:03.960 --> 01:08.280
You don't need me, you could be training plus the community, you have every answer to every

01:08.280 --> 01:12.200
question you could possibly have, however, we try to come on here to give you just that

01:12.200 --> 01:18.120
extra training the the the new updates the this the that the specific nuance questions

01:18.120 --> 01:21.480
because we can never, it'd be impossible to answer every single question but here's the

01:21.480 --> 01:26.120
great part is if you guys ask these questions on these calls, like Aaron's about to ask

01:26.120 --> 01:30.840
Francesca, we're going to cut that a little assuming the answer doesn't suck, Francesca

01:30.840 --> 01:32.720
we're going to cut it.

01:32.720 --> 01:33.720
Just kidding.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.640
And then we're going to put that inside of the Kajabi training so that we can have the

01:36.640 --> 01:40.840
specific questions the nuanced questions as many as possible inside the training.

01:40.840 --> 01:45.800
So if you guys have been in this group, the training changes every single week we literally

01:45.800 --> 01:51.240
have add we add one to three to five new videos every single week I don't know if you guys

01:51.240 --> 01:54.360
continually logging in but we want you guys in there and checking it out.

01:54.360 --> 01:57.320
So that said, go ahead and ask the question let's get into it.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.320
Yeah, absolutely.

01:58.320 --> 02:03.800
So Daniel says, how do you vet these videos instead of just picking the first one?

02:03.800 --> 02:11.680
Yeah, so I think it starts when you're transferring the free leads to them and your live transferring

02:11.680 --> 02:17.080
yourself like that's the first thing that you want to watch out is to the sound professional,

02:17.080 --> 02:20.480
you know, that's the first thing that you really notice and usually that gives you a

02:20.640 --> 02:21.840
pretty good idea.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.560
And then the second one is when you get on a zoom call, also like the follow up like

02:25.560 --> 02:29.640
when you follow up on those leads that you sent over how quicker they do answer the closing

02:29.640 --> 02:32.200
them if not do they have stupid excuses.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.800
So that's another thing.

02:33.800 --> 02:38.000
And then another one would be when you get on a zoom call before you kind of start you

02:38.000 --> 02:43.400
ask them questions like are you looking to grow where are you at gather as much as information

02:43.400 --> 02:47.480
before you even start going into you know wasting too much time and that would probably

02:47.480 --> 02:50.720
be the final thing you do to check it.

02:50.720 --> 02:54.200
You kind of get a pretty good idea after you do all of that to be honest especially after

02:54.200 --> 02:59.080
you close a bunch of them because you get the senses that kind of tell you this is good

02:59.080 --> 03:00.080
this is not good.

03:00.080 --> 03:04.200
Yeah, do you have a couple like specifics real quick on this question like and that

03:04.200 --> 03:07.520
opening cold call obviously this is a little hard because it's a balance if you don't want

03:07.520 --> 03:11.440
to get hung up on but then also you don't want to agree to give them free leads if they're

03:11.440 --> 03:16.400
not a good fit like what are some telltale signs you look on and that first cold call

03:16.440 --> 03:18.800
of like if they're maybe a good fit or not.

03:18.800 --> 03:24.640
Yeah, I think like breaking that relationship during the cold calling is way easier than

03:24.640 --> 03:26.760
waiting to do the zoom call anyway.

03:26.760 --> 03:31.840
So you if you catch something off I would almost suggest being stricter then because

03:31.840 --> 03:35.680
that way you're not wasting too much time you know because there's always going to be

03:35.680 --> 03:39.360
not always but you're going to have a few more free leads to send someone else at that

03:39.360 --> 03:40.360
point.

03:40.360 --> 03:46.360
I would say like if you transfer I had one I remember I transferred the lead and he

03:46.360 --> 03:52.360
wouldn't talk so I said hello are you there and we're like all he would say was yeah

03:53.080 --> 03:59.240
like introduce yourself like say something and that to me was like okay no like he wouldn't

03:59.240 --> 04:04.360
say you know anything his name nothing even you know you introduce them but still like

04:04.360 --> 04:09.240
you've got to have someone that sounds alive on the other end so stuff like that like you

04:09.240 --> 04:14.200
just kind of feel off I would say that sounds unprofessional or I've had a few like you

04:14.200 --> 04:17.720
transfer the lead they sound good and then when you check in on them and say hey how

04:17.720 --> 04:22.280
did that go did you close them did you give them a quote and they get back to you saying

04:22.280 --> 04:27.560
um I didn't have enough time I have to call them back then you're like okay stuff like

04:27.560 --> 04:33.720
that will make you kind of wonder you'll know yeah for sure and like actually like I added

04:33.720 --> 04:40.520
one quick thing like they got to want leads if they're a cavalier about it you don't really have

04:41.320 --> 04:45.160
that much control if they're like and we're doing pretty good like they could be lying so it could

04:45.160 --> 04:48.760
be a smoke screen so you don't want to address that but like I remember talking with one dude

04:48.760 --> 04:53.800
he was like 55 I don't know what I was thinking homeboy was not ready to hustle for more leads

04:54.600 --> 04:59.640
right and so I didn't really have like any leverage or any control because he didn't care

04:59.640 --> 05:05.640
and so in that situation you like the guys that are hungry to grow again just because someone

05:05.640 --> 05:08.680
says we're doing good doesn't mean they actually aren't hungry and they could get really hooked

05:08.680 --> 05:14.680
by your free leads but that's still something to focus on and you can do the pull back then

05:14.680 --> 05:19.560
like if they act like that and they're like well I'm already and then be like then what did you

05:19.560 --> 05:25.000
agree on getting a few free jobs if you're already great right do you want them or do you not then

05:25.000 --> 05:30.440
you're like you can just be honest with me you know you know I'm a big man you can just tell me

05:32.040 --> 05:37.000
and then they're usually like no that's not what I meant or whatever something done like that

05:37.000 --> 05:42.280
that's usually what they say looks like nick has his hand up yeah um

05:44.840 --> 05:52.760
um machete okay just want to get your attention um funny that aaron said that um the number one

05:52.760 --> 06:00.200
thing in a business owner is a hungry business owner right because they they you're not going

06:00.200 --> 06:05.640
to find that you can't as much as I would love to have every business owner be good at sales

06:06.600 --> 06:11.640
most of them suck like they're they're like old plumber let's say it's in the plumbing industry

06:11.640 --> 06:16.360
for septic right we do submit they're probably an old plumber that decided to open their company

06:16.360 --> 06:20.760
they're not trained in sales not always if you find the one that are that are good at plumbing

06:20.760 --> 06:26.760
and business people those ones are really good typically you don't find that so you have to

06:26.840 --> 06:35.480
remember it's kind of like like I guess so aaron aaron is is is currently single just fyi for any

06:35.480 --> 06:40.760
of the ladies out there um at some point aaron's gonna start freaking working the field aaron's

06:40.760 --> 06:46.040
gonna start hunting you know he's gonna start freaking prowling around and uh he's gonna want

06:46.040 --> 06:50.600
to have a list of things even if it's in his head of things that he's looking for and as much as

06:50.600 --> 06:54.920
he'd like to have every single one of those things which he could he may be looking for a long time

06:54.920 --> 06:58.520
and so you kind of have to have this list within your head of like what do you want that business

06:58.520 --> 07:03.000
owner it's your partner what are the things ideally you would want that business owner to have

07:03.000 --> 07:08.520
and then in what order are they most important and to me the most important thing is is a hunger

07:08.520 --> 07:12.920
for leads because if they're hungry for leads then they're gonna do their very very best and

07:12.920 --> 07:17.880
they may not be perfect on the phone they may sound really gravely and scary and they might

07:17.880 --> 07:22.120
have not great customer service but at least they're hungry they're following up they want

07:22.120 --> 07:27.560
that business on the other hand they can be the best talker in the world they can be the best

07:27.560 --> 07:31.480
whatever communicator but if they're not hungry for the leads they're not like francesca said

07:31.480 --> 07:35.560
they're not going to call them they're not going to address them they're not going to um they're

07:36.120 --> 07:40.120
you're going to really really get frustrated so to me the number one thing i look for is a hungry

07:40.120 --> 07:44.600
business owner and how do we know that guys aaron how do we know someone's hungry typically

07:46.200 --> 07:51.000
when they actually are responsive they're responsive but also going back to building the

07:51.000 --> 07:56.360
list is they're already paying yeah we're already paying because if they're already paying they're

07:56.360 --> 08:02.360
either a hungry for more leads or b they're they're allergic to money right and the chance

08:02.360 --> 08:12.920
of it being b is low right so great question awesome well that's it yeah i say this a lot

08:12.920 --> 08:15.720
just because somebody's willing to give you money doesn't mean you should take it

08:16.680 --> 08:21.640
yeah we were talking about that earlier we've all gotten the business owner we know we can close

08:21.640 --> 08:25.640
them we know they give us the money but you just know deep down they're not going to stay with you

08:25.640 --> 08:29.640
for a long time and i will say at the beginning when you start your business sometimes you just

08:29.640 --> 08:34.200
get that deal to get that win get a little money coming in but you'll get to a point where you

08:34.200 --> 08:38.280
realize that person even though i might be able to get them for the next three months it's going

08:38.280 --> 08:43.720
to tie me up during the best time of year i'd rather skip them and wait another two three weeks

08:43.800 --> 08:47.960
and it's hard to make that big boy big girl decision because now you have to cold call again

08:47.960 --> 08:51.720
now you have to go through all the heart the headache and the heartache of doing this again

08:52.360 --> 08:57.640
but if you do that deal that's six months you're going to tie yourself up during the best time and

08:57.640 --> 09:02.600
you might miss out on a better business owner so once you've been in it a while you realize that

09:03.640 --> 09:08.120
not all money is money that you should take and sometimes you can get a deal and you choose not

09:08.120 --> 09:11.880
to get a deal because you know it's not going to last because they as aaron said are not going to

09:11.880 --> 09:14.440
make money if they don't make money they're not going to stay with you no matter how

09:15.240 --> 09:20.360
great the money sounds it's not long-term money it's not big money it's not you know forever money

09:22.760 --> 09:27.000
for sure so with these questions guys if we have time we will do questions at the end we're getting

09:27.000 --> 09:31.720
some great comments but i'll probably kind of just like slowly exit out here and let you guys

09:31.720 --> 09:37.720
handle the topic of the call of how to replace a client beautiful um are you gonna stay on this

09:37.720 --> 09:42.840
call are you hopping off to get to work no i'll stay on because i don't want to like mess up the

09:42.840 --> 09:46.760
hosting with yeah stay on and then i'm gonna have you check the comments i'm not even going

09:46.760 --> 09:49.960
to worry about logging on facebook and have you check the comments and then anything that's

09:49.960 --> 09:57.000
pertinent to what we're talking about then i want you to jump in and ask it so um really quick i

09:57.000 --> 10:01.800
don't know this could take a while this could not take a while but what i want to the the focus of

10:01.800 --> 10:06.120
today's call is i want to talk about getting a new client um replacing your business owner

10:06.680 --> 10:12.120
and so a couple things and i wanted to bring francesca on because she just replaced a business

10:12.120 --> 10:17.240
owner when was this this is just you just replaced this person like last week

10:18.600 --> 10:24.040
yeah so we're going to talk about this this is something that is going to happen so number one

10:24.040 --> 10:31.160
you guys i want to say is that you are going to have to do this and sometimes it's not your fault

10:31.160 --> 10:36.760
right sometimes you're producing great leads nothing's changed and the business owner

10:37.880 --> 10:44.600
they're bad at managing money they something happens and you know what they they they start

10:44.600 --> 10:49.320
cutting they start cutting costs and they're not they're not long-sighted enough to realize

10:49.320 --> 10:52.360
that they're cutting the very thing that's actually growing their business and they're

10:52.360 --> 10:57.800
going to call you and say hey i i just don't want to pay for these leads anymore and that's just a

10:57.800 --> 11:01.960
reality so you are going to have to replace clients it's just part of the game don't feel bad

11:01.960 --> 11:06.840
don't you know crawl in bed it's just going to happen right and i need you guys to remember that

11:07.560 --> 11:14.600
this is the same as physical real estate if you own a fourplex you can't assume that the first

11:14.600 --> 11:19.800
four people you put in there are never going to leave guess what sometimes those people are there

11:19.800 --> 11:24.840
while they gather enough money to go build their own house and sometimes your business owners are

11:24.840 --> 11:30.920
taking your leads long enough that they can go and they can start you know you know really putting

11:30.920 --> 11:35.400
some time and energy and effort into their own website and generating their own leads and guess

11:35.400 --> 11:40.120
what hopefully you you they trust you and you gain enough of their trust that they'll come to you and

11:40.120 --> 11:46.120
you can do that for them but sometimes business owners they they move out right they go on to

11:46.120 --> 11:51.400
other things and sometimes just like tenants maybe their friends are at this other place

11:51.960 --> 11:57.640
and there's a pool there right or there's it's closer to their work and they decide that they're

11:57.640 --> 12:03.640
going to move over there they're going to move their money over there and all you can do just

12:03.640 --> 12:08.520
like if you own the fourplex you could make it the best fourplex in town you could add as many

12:08.520 --> 12:14.040
amenities as possible you could be the the easy to call easy to get a hold of good communication

12:14.040 --> 12:19.240
make sure everything's always working you can make that the best possible situation but sometimes

12:19.240 --> 12:23.640
you are in the wrong location and it's nothing you can do and so you have to remember that even

12:23.640 --> 12:31.480
in physical real estate no matter how good your property is people just move that's it also in

12:31.480 --> 12:36.360
physical real estate guess what you could do everything right and sometimes people are just

12:36.360 --> 12:42.040
crappy people just don't pay their bill people just think that they can sit in your property

12:42.040 --> 12:46.200
and they don't have to pay you right and they're entitled whatever and you have to replace them you

12:46.200 --> 12:50.920
have to evict them and guess what guys sometimes you got to evict your business owners out of these

12:50.920 --> 12:56.280
websites and the good thing is is in this business it's really easy to evict you just take the tracking

12:56.280 --> 13:00.760
number and you switch it to somewhere else and you take the the the quote forms and you push them

13:00.760 --> 13:07.560
somewhere else that's it you're done completely completely done okay so um we want to go through

13:07.560 --> 13:11.240
this really quick and i want to just talk to francesca because she just did this and kind of

13:11.240 --> 13:15.960
go step by step on how to replace it we're going to talk about two different things number one

13:15.960 --> 13:20.200
we're going to talk about how to replace a business how to replace uh a new get a new business owner

13:20.200 --> 13:26.120
for a website that doesn't have a tenant maybe they moved out on their own and now you're stuck

13:26.120 --> 13:29.480
and you don't have any money coming in and that's a little bit more urgent because you're not making

13:29.480 --> 13:33.880
money and then if we have time i want to talk about replacing a business owner when you already

13:33.880 --> 13:40.520
have a business owner finding having a a business owner in tow to come and then drive the other one

13:40.520 --> 13:46.520
out onto the street and do so you know happily put them get them create make the business owner

13:46.520 --> 13:52.840
homeless you know metaphorically and uh and get somebody else in there so francesca let's talk

13:52.840 --> 14:00.280
about when we have a website let's use one of our websites that's currently vacant right like i know

14:00.280 --> 14:06.280
uh is it st george tree service that recently became vacant yeah okay st george tree service

14:06.280 --> 14:11.160
we had a really good client we signed them in 2020 they were with us for over three years and

14:11.160 --> 14:15.720
it was again one of these examples they basically were like hey we're gonna go a different direction

14:15.720 --> 14:20.920
and i think based on what i've seen they probably had their niece or nephew or somebody at a dinner

14:20.920 --> 14:25.560
party was like oh i could do a really good job for you for you're spending a thousand dollars

14:25.560 --> 14:29.800
and they probably are building their own website whatever and they're good people i'm still friends

14:29.880 --> 14:36.040
them on facebook um you know i'm never gonna just burn bridges right but they decided to

14:36.040 --> 14:43.000
to move a different direction so i know we also replaced that tenant with one of our other

14:43.000 --> 14:47.560
tenants that covered this area kind of but they had to drive and it didn't really work out

14:47.560 --> 14:52.520
so we have this property it's vacant st george tree service what you know and i know we've been

14:52.520 --> 14:57.480
focusing on some other properties before this we just uh did a new one and also guys remember

14:57.480 --> 15:03.240
even us we have to do this too so you guys should realize this is just a thing francesca what's the

15:03.240 --> 15:07.960
next step right now we have a vacant property st george tree service what's our very next step

15:07.960 --> 15:15.320
what are you doing and what is our process that anyone could follow yeah so the first thing i do

15:15.960 --> 15:23.160
especially we ended things on a good note is i honestly just ask them and say hey like would

15:23.160 --> 15:29.080
you have someone else that you know would be like kind of ask for a referral and i offer like

15:29.080 --> 15:35.960
a gift card something small um so i do that first if that doesn't work and they don't know anyone

15:35.960 --> 15:45.160
they do know people but they don't want to give you anyone um right um i rebuilt that prospecting

15:45.160 --> 15:49.400
list of business owners especially when it's been a while because you might have new businesses that

15:49.400 --> 15:55.400
came in people are buying ads now whatever it may be i get that refreshed up i also do a due

15:55.400 --> 16:01.240
diligence just in case i want to see like if things change because keep in mind like especially for a

16:01.240 --> 16:07.000
client that you had for three years most likely the ads you really lowered because you started

16:07.000 --> 16:12.280
ranking so i just redo the due diligence as well kind of see where we're at i do a little digging

16:12.280 --> 16:17.560
on the leads that we're getting i honestly don't i feel like it's more pressure when you're starting

16:17.560 --> 16:23.480
a new project than when you're trying to replace one because you do have experience in that project

16:23.480 --> 16:29.560
already you already did half of the work for it and then you know kind of what to expect in terms

16:29.560 --> 16:36.520
of leads for the year most of the time so you have that going going for you and then then i just start

16:36.520 --> 16:44.280
cold calling so that would be those would be the steps in that case so a couple things number one

16:44.280 --> 16:51.800
is that it sounds funny to ask for a referral but it is true and sometimes these business owners

16:51.800 --> 16:56.680
they actually feel bad because they like you they made money with you and for whatever reason they

16:56.680 --> 17:00.360
just want to go a different direction and sometimes it's not even against you so i think it's really

17:00.360 --> 17:07.800
wise to ask because you can actually get referrals and do it in a very strategic way where you don't

17:07.800 --> 17:12.920
come off desperate like maybe say hey sorry sorry to interrupt i just thought about something that

17:12.920 --> 17:18.680
really works if they have a contract let's say it's august now the contract is up in october one

17:18.680 --> 17:24.120
thing that really works is oh i know like you're going a different direction what if you help me

17:24.120 --> 17:30.760
you know find someone else to replace you we can shorten your contract money and get them on before

17:30.760 --> 17:36.680
so they can take over your contract that really really works yeah then they're not on the hook

17:36.680 --> 17:40.840
and it kind of like lets them know hey we are going to stick to this contract just so you know

17:40.920 --> 17:45.480
so i really like that but number one ask and this is going back to so many different things

17:45.480 --> 17:49.720
we talked about guys don't burn bridges don't be a dude like somebody texts you hey they're

17:49.720 --> 17:53.480
going in a different direction you i know like i my immediately first response i want to go burn

17:53.480 --> 17:59.880
their house down right like that's like the first thing i want to do like just burn their house down

17:59.880 --> 18:05.080
you know slash their tires all that stuff that's like my first response right i carry this in my

18:05.720 --> 18:11.800
and after that i'm like okay nick that's you know it's no it's not personal whatever and so

18:11.800 --> 18:15.800
that's that's a great step but this is what i like that francesca said is really important

18:16.440 --> 18:20.200
guys you should be constantly if you have projects even if they're ranking

18:21.240 --> 18:25.560
or maybe they're partially ranking you're still spending money on ads whatever it's always good

18:25.560 --> 18:31.240
to i would say once a year especially as you have client turnover and you're still trying to rank

18:31.320 --> 18:35.320
is i would go and if you're ranked top of the google of google whatever that's fine

18:35.320 --> 18:39.880
right but if you're still in the process bottom page one it's always good to go and do a little

18:39.880 --> 18:45.400
do another due diligence see where things are at see if there's new competition in town see if

18:45.400 --> 18:51.400
there's new people that are running ads go from a to z see that process because you'd be surprised

18:51.400 --> 18:56.120
like there's businesses that like for example artificial grass businesses there's like four

18:56.120 --> 19:01.560
new artificial grass businesses that have popped up in my town since we landed our client and our

19:01.560 --> 19:05.640
client's still with us but if we were to switch over in fact i had somebody reach out to me on

19:05.640 --> 19:10.440
instagram that we could sell those leads do we have we actually have a backup right now francesca

19:10.440 --> 19:14.920
for our artificial grass website that i've told i think i've talked to you about that we just

19:14.920 --> 19:21.000
can't work with because we only work with one company so um do the due diligence right keep

19:21.000 --> 19:25.240
a good relationship ask them for referrals if possible and i was going to say do it in a way

19:25.240 --> 19:31.640
that's not doesn't sound desperate hey mr business owner um you know we've got you know

19:31.640 --> 19:36.040
two or three people that we were talking to when we decided to work with you but before i do that

19:36.040 --> 19:40.600
since i know you and i trust you is there anyone that you would recommend or that you know that we

19:40.600 --> 19:44.200
should talk to before i go talk to those people because i'd always appreciate someone that you

19:44.200 --> 19:50.120
trust because these leads this is my name on this right versus hey do you know anyone i could sell

19:50.120 --> 19:57.480
these two right you sound like the the the the desperate person that's just looking for any and

19:57.480 --> 20:02.360
everything right yeah you you think i could you could hawk these leads for 200 bucks a month

20:02.360 --> 20:09.400
to anybody you know what i'm saying so there's a really fine line of how to do it um and i think

20:09.400 --> 20:13.560
i'm really professional at this because i have an ego and i never want to sound desperate like it's

20:13.560 --> 20:17.480
really hard for me to ask for anything especially for something that makes me look and i put in

20:17.480 --> 20:24.200
that position okay okay so you build a list right you look at the due diligence you build the list

20:24.200 --> 20:29.560
and then does your pitch change talk to us about that does your pitch change is it back to the

20:29.560 --> 20:34.600
exact same thing what are you doing now maybe the website's ranked it's getting a certain amount of

20:34.600 --> 20:39.160
leads you know roughly how many leads it's getting because it's getting you know 20 to 30 leads a

20:39.160 --> 20:46.040
month no ads or very little ads what is your pitch how does it change compared to the first time

20:46.040 --> 20:52.120
talk talk about that for a second yeah i feel i mean i don't know why but i do feel more confident

20:52.120 --> 20:57.640
when i'm pitching something that i already had for a longer time because like you said i know

20:58.440 --> 21:03.480
more of the expectations i know exactly how many leads we have been getting but i still do not

21:03.480 --> 21:10.920
tell them hey this is how much like i still keep you know keep it as a secret because i don't want

21:10.920 --> 21:16.600
them to have high expectations and also like things can change and you never really know so

21:16.600 --> 21:22.520
the only thing that i would say changes is the fact that you go in knowing yourself but i don't

21:22.520 --> 21:28.040
necessarily share them you know with them hey we usually get 20 30 leads you can share like hey

21:28.040 --> 21:32.600
we've been having this project for a very long time we used to work with you don't tell them who

21:32.600 --> 21:38.440
unless it's a referral obviously um so you can tell them like you had yes of course you can take

21:38.440 --> 21:44.200
that and tell them but you don't go you still don't want to promise them 20 30 leads a month

21:44.200 --> 21:50.520
because if for some reason december you're not getting them they call you up smart as much as

21:50.520 --> 21:56.840
you want to i never like to leave with that um unless it's getting like 50 consistently and then

21:56.840 --> 22:02.360
you're like yeah this thing's getting like 20 20 plus right like a number that you get like there's

22:02.360 --> 22:07.080
no way you could go wrong on but other than that i wouldn't even try to you know give them a number

22:07.080 --> 22:10.600
because then they're going to be they're going to be making a decision based on that number so

22:10.600 --> 22:15.880
um my experience call after you lose a tenant and you have leads coming in consistently

22:16.440 --> 22:21.960
it's so much easier to call it's you're you're so much more confident

22:22.920 --> 22:29.720
because you have this project you know what it produces um you've seen it it's been consistent

22:29.720 --> 22:33.480
you know it's not going anywhere and here's the best part is most of the time you don't have to

22:33.480 --> 22:39.640
spend money on ads so you're all the money you're gonna get you're gonna get as mostly profit

22:40.520 --> 22:44.920
right you're not gonna have to worry about ads and all this different stuff and so um okay so when

22:44.920 --> 22:51.000
you do call do you you try to mention that there was somebody before talk about that like how do

22:51.000 --> 22:57.400
you bring it up and i'm just asking you specifically i know the way that i do it um but i'm curious with

22:57.400 --> 23:02.280
you how do you do it do you bring up that you had somebody else buying them do you just say

23:02.280 --> 23:07.960
that you have a website is it the same exact script like tell us about that yeah it depends

23:07.960 --> 23:12.920
like is it coming from a referral then you have to mention it because they probably have already

23:12.920 --> 23:18.600
talked to them and you can kind of leverage that because you can ask the other guy like to give

23:18.600 --> 23:23.400
you like a good review in that terms like they probably talk there you know he then you have that

23:23.400 --> 23:28.920
advantage so it does depend on how did you find them did you just call call them like a new project

23:28.920 --> 23:34.200
or was there a referral that's like the main thing and then yeah it's really based on that

23:34.200 --> 23:40.440
like how did that come through if it's you're just calling them i mean i don't necessarily

23:40.440 --> 23:44.840
tell them like hey we used to have this guy and we lost them so that's why i'm calling you because

23:44.840 --> 23:52.440
you sound desperate okay i agree guys if you have websites right now that are producing leads

23:52.440 --> 23:59.880
especially organic leads you're you're sitting on free money like that should be your number

23:59.880 --> 24:04.440
one priority right now francesco that should be our number one priority right because it's like

24:04.440 --> 24:13.320
this we own some office space in st george and we had you know there was a period of time where

24:13.320 --> 24:19.880
i was in an office kyle was in an office isaac was in an office francesco was in an office i think we

24:19.880 --> 24:25.000
had in one other person that off porter was using an office like we mainly use the offices and then

24:25.000 --> 24:32.280
i started traveling kyle started working from home porter started working on the farm isaac was back

24:32.280 --> 24:37.640
in portland and we were just all remote and i remember just one day and this sounds so silly

24:37.640 --> 24:42.680
that i took me so long but i'm like dude there's literally just money like we're just like there's

24:42.680 --> 24:47.080
free money right and so i started talking to francesco every week i'm like francesco we just

24:47.080 --> 24:52.600
need to rent these offices out because it costs us nothing they're just it's just empty space

24:52.600 --> 24:57.560
that can't bring in money and and that's it she started renting these offices out and i mean

24:58.520 --> 25:06.040
i don't know what did we rent that corner one out for finally um 50 huh the corner one

25:06.040 --> 25:12.360
yeah 650 650 bucks a month times it by 12 that was just sitting there no one is in it

25:13.080 --> 25:18.840
right and and we we in our heads we knew we should rent it out but i mean what is that what is 650

25:18.840 --> 25:27.320
times 12 it's like seven it's like eight thousand bucks something like that right roughly thousand

25:27.320 --> 25:33.320
eight hundred eight eight thousand eight hundred seven seven thousand eight seven thousand eight

25:33.320 --> 25:39.720
hundred dollars that we just were like yeah and all we had to do and francesco took photos she

25:39.720 --> 25:44.360
put it on marketplace lo and behold we're completely booked other than we have one tiny

25:44.360 --> 25:48.680
little office is kyle's little harry potter closet he used to work out of that uh we started letting

25:48.680 --> 25:55.400
him work from home um because he could barely even fit in the door but besides the harry potter

25:55.400 --> 26:01.480
closet we're completely rented out so the fact of the matter if you guys have properties that are

26:01.480 --> 26:08.840
rentable right now that should be your number one focus number one focus and i have a couple of

26:08.840 --> 26:15.480
there's a couple of ideas that i could give you guys guys think outside the box on like yes build

26:15.480 --> 26:21.400
the list right um uh go and do what we did list building the best thing to do is is go and find

26:21.400 --> 26:25.640
people that are paying for google ads but guess what you can also you know what i do every time

26:25.640 --> 26:31.480
i get the mail i freaking i'm collecting these things baby so right now we have a epoxy guy

26:31.480 --> 26:36.760
but guess what as soon as epoxy guy decides to go sideways i got his replacement right here he's

26:36.760 --> 26:42.040
spending money on paper right dude wants leads bad enough he's spending money on this stuff okay

26:42.040 --> 26:47.640
look at that uh that's not a good one i'm not going to do carpet cleaning but i just want to

26:47.640 --> 26:52.760
show you guys an example these guys are spending money on these cards this isn't google ads but

26:52.760 --> 26:58.200
this costs them money these people are hungry for leads or they're stupid either way i want to talk

26:58.200 --> 27:04.360
to you right fun to talk to stupid people sometimes look at this i got a depth cleaning back up as soon

27:04.360 --> 27:09.400
as mr joe go ahead and write this down francesca as soon as mr joe goes sideways duck pros is

27:09.400 --> 27:16.440
getting our leads okay boom evergreen maintenance just i got yeah i don't think that's a good one

27:16.440 --> 27:24.120
just wanted to hold that up what's hold on i got one more for you oh look at this an artificial

27:24.120 --> 27:30.920
grass replacement our third replacement so guys um i actually have a book downstairs

27:31.880 --> 27:36.840
i text my son to bring it up because i don't think he got my message i there's this guy that

27:36.840 --> 27:42.760
i know in town and he has this business called dixie direct direct direct and it's like deals

27:42.760 --> 27:47.800
right his name's tony and he used to live by me and uh he come people they sell these books and

27:47.800 --> 27:53.320
i always buy i don't even use them i buy them just to get ideas i literally last night i was

27:53.320 --> 27:59.000
eating i was eating mexican food and i'm like a hundred years old i'm flipping through this deal

27:59.080 --> 28:05.880
book and i don't give a rat's you know what about deals i do i like free money but i was more

28:05.880 --> 28:10.280
interested in like oh interesting these guys how much because i know how much he charges right he

28:10.280 --> 28:15.400
charges like 5 000 bucks a year so i'm like dude that's like a four or five hundred dollar a month

28:15.400 --> 28:20.520
client right there that's probably not getting any business from this right so just wanted to

28:20.520 --> 28:26.840
point out yes use the go and look for people paying for google ads but don't sleep on this

28:26.840 --> 28:32.360
stuff guys somebody had to pay money to get this to your door that means they want leads this is a

28:32.360 --> 28:40.760
hungry business owner right here okay so eagle creek landscape dude you're in trouble once we

28:40.760 --> 28:45.560
lose our client dude eagle eagle creek they're gonna get freaking either gonna work this or

28:45.560 --> 28:53.400
burn it on their house baby those are two options okay um one more just just a niche idea this is

28:53.400 --> 28:58.120
kind of a side thing and then we're getting questions i never even thought about this niche

28:58.120 --> 29:06.040
this is interesting affordable sheds and garages mobile sheds and garages that's an interesting

29:06.040 --> 29:12.840
niche or maybe it's not even a mobile but maybe it's um just sheds and garages like detached

29:12.840 --> 29:17.240
sheds and garage building that's an interesting one i bet those suckers right there those probably

29:17.240 --> 29:22.840
cost five ten grand right it's a structure and i guarantee they don't cost that much to build

29:23.880 --> 29:31.400
anyway just a niche idea for those of you that think it's saturated and on that note of replacing

29:31.400 --> 29:37.160
a client so obviously talking about prospecting in relation to replacing a client iman says that

29:37.160 --> 29:41.000
facebook and facebook has been an absolute goldmine for finding hungry business owners

29:41.000 --> 29:45.240
but then the caveat problem is finding quality people who actually have money and don't squander

29:45.240 --> 29:49.240
the opportunity but checking marketplace and local business groups has been really good so you can

29:49.240 --> 29:54.760
at least possibly find engagement or interest even if not actively paying a lot of times when

29:54.760 --> 29:59.080
you look in a facebook group and it's like the recommendations on concrete and then people will

29:59.080 --> 30:04.280
tag yeah talk to mark mark doesn't even have a business but it's like he's the number one

30:04.280 --> 30:09.960
recommended person it's a good lead but you have to remember that that person might be getting a

30:09.960 --> 30:15.400
lot of inbound business so they might not be hungry but i remember i had my my very first towing client

30:15.560 --> 30:21.320
before i sold my website to i actually sold it to shiv i don't know if you guys knew this

30:21.320 --> 30:26.360
but shiv's actually the one that bought my freaking dumpy websites shit i freaking just

30:26.360 --> 30:30.280
dumped that on ship i'm kidding he still makes like 600 bucks a month for the last three years

30:30.280 --> 30:36.440
he actually won but i couldn't find a client man i went through everybody dude and towing is not

30:36.440 --> 30:40.600
a fun one francesca just replaced our towing client and it's a hard one because towing people

30:40.600 --> 30:44.440
are generally not that intelligent it's hard it's hard it's hard to even get motivated to talk to

30:44.440 --> 30:48.920
these people because they're just they're just not smart like mostly right that sounds rude

30:48.920 --> 30:56.040
they're just not i went to lunch with one dude dude's belly's hanging out freaking just i mean

30:56.040 --> 31:02.920
and i mean that like hanging out standing like he did doesn't care about life in the whole time

31:03.640 --> 31:09.240
it was just the whole conversation was loud and he didn't get it right and i only say that because

31:09.240 --> 31:15.640
they're just sloppy like wear a t-shirt that fits dude taking this guy to lunch and his t-shirt

31:15.640 --> 31:22.360
doesn't even fit if that's not indicative of the fact he's not going to answer the phone nothing

31:22.360 --> 31:25.800
is guys you're here we're talking to a business owner make sure their t-shirt fits that's like

31:25.800 --> 31:33.880
number one okay okay so um where was i going with this i'm like i'm i'm i'm turning into

31:34.360 --> 31:41.320
west here i'm clear over here and then i'm apologizing oh where was i at um long story

31:41.320 --> 31:46.280
short guys is you can think outside the box yeah iman said facebook is a good place to get ideas

31:47.080 --> 31:53.720
but remember the number one thing with replacing someone is a hungry business owner i'll take that

31:53.720 --> 31:59.560
over over the good sales guy over the polished person because if they're hungry you they're

31:59.560 --> 32:02.920
trained they're usually teachable they're coachable they're whatever so

32:02.920 --> 32:07.080
just keep dude i have a collection of this stuff okay let's go through a couple questions really

32:07.080 --> 32:12.200
quick awesome yeah and by the way actually guys what we're gonna do is this is something and nick

32:12.200 --> 32:15.960
we actually haven't talked about this but what we'll start to do is after each live we're

32:15.960 --> 32:21.560
transitioning things over to um a better way to handle support because obviously we've been doing

32:21.560 --> 32:26.040
dms for the longest time and honestly guys it gets a little some it's easy to miss messages

32:26.040 --> 32:31.480
because obviously facebook messenger is not meant for like crm right like it's just meant for like

32:31.480 --> 32:35.240
homies interacting but what we're obviously we've announced this a while back with transitioning

32:35.240 --> 32:38.920
things something called fresh desk it's just going to be a better support ticket system

32:38.920 --> 32:42.440
but not only just handling messages the reason i bring that up is after each live what we're

32:42.440 --> 32:47.480
going to start to do is actually create like a little like a cheat sheet for each of these lives

32:47.480 --> 32:51.720
so obviously we were talking about in this one how to replace a client francesca just listed off

32:51.720 --> 32:55.960
like five bullet points or five steps and so what we're gonna do is we're gonna put that in

32:55.960 --> 33:00.600
like a nice little article or a little document on fresh desk put under frequently asked questions

33:00.600 --> 33:06.440
such as how to replace a client that way you guys can have that and i think one thing we're talking

33:06.440 --> 33:13.240
about too is taking these lives putting them into kajabi and title you know titling them and putting

33:13.240 --> 33:19.720
the attached digital resource with it so we're gonna try and get you guys you know instead of

33:19.720 --> 33:23.880
having to watch the whole live again give me a look at the cheat sheet and go oh yeah here was

33:23.880 --> 33:28.040
the bullet points whatever so yeah you guys can start expecting that guys you should be in you

33:28.040 --> 33:32.760
should have kajabi the training bookmarked and you should be in it every day because they're we're

33:32.760 --> 33:38.120
literally adding stuff every day like at least a couple times a week so anyway see if there's

33:38.120 --> 33:44.840
any other questions yeah no for sure so um Mahmood said he'll take uh the harry powder closet needs

33:44.920 --> 33:50.840
some peace and quiet love it bro come out bro every time Mahmood comes out good things happen

33:50.840 --> 33:57.400
we we do random cold calls on the spot um let's see brad hardy said i'm in portable building niche

33:57.400 --> 34:02.920
5k minimum i think relating to the shed idea there we go there's another niche i've never even thought

34:02.920 --> 34:08.520
about that niche francesca can we do some due diligence on saint george utah today please today

34:08.520 --> 34:15.400
yeah let's go ahead and do that okay this yeah for sure luke hill said i'm curious if you guys

34:15.400 --> 34:19.960
can do a training on best way to price deals there's an immediate live nick or at least

34:19.960 --> 34:23.640
youtube video that i remember what you kind of talked about when you went through the tool

34:23.640 --> 34:29.240
so i can yeah will you share that and come back maybe what you can do is after we get off you can

34:29.240 --> 34:34.040
go find it and then post it as a reply that's a really good training because there it's there's

34:34.040 --> 34:41.000
a very calculated formula for how to price deals like we don't just guess it's literally based on

34:41.000 --> 34:45.080
a formula so post that but yeah we could always do that again i don't think there's much that we

34:45.080 --> 34:49.480
could say on top of what we already said because nothing's changed but we do have a very specific

34:49.480 --> 34:54.280
formula on how to price deals oh yeah for sure it gives you a whole lot of confidence because

34:54.280 --> 34:58.200
it's just math in the end it removes the emotion from sales and that's what we say in the training

34:58.200 --> 35:02.760
too is like this is for the business owner to make it make sense but it's more for you to go

35:02.760 --> 35:09.400
in there confidently going hey if i can even get half of what i'm thinking i can double your money

35:09.400 --> 35:13.640
as long as you answer the freaking phone and do a decent job and you can go in there asking for a

35:13.640 --> 35:19.080
retainer of two thousand bucks with confidence not just shaking in your boots freaking you know

35:19.080 --> 35:25.480
with that tight t-shirt with mr towing keep going yeah for sure this is an earlier question about

35:25.480 --> 35:29.400
the tool iman said did you build the tool are you just promoting it or kind of like just getting

35:30.360 --> 35:38.120
so we built it we've been working on this anytime you build tools they tell you it's going to take

35:38.120 --> 35:42.040
a certain amount of time you always are like yeah we're going to expect the worst case and it's

35:42.040 --> 35:48.760
always like double that because so i have been it's been over a year for just so you know it's

35:48.760 --> 35:52.760
been over one year so those of you that are think i've just been avoiding it's been a year and i

35:52.760 --> 35:58.360
finally was like dude i'm tired of like using semrush i'm literally spending 99 bucks a month

35:58.360 --> 36:05.000
for semrush for for the search feature and i was like annoyed so um right now i'm over

36:06.680 --> 36:13.400
50 000 into this thing in a year so this isn't just some you know i'm not promoting you guys

36:13.400 --> 36:18.680
know this i don't sell we haven't we don't try to sell you guys stuff right the only reason we even

36:18.680 --> 36:24.280
talk about this is because i'm tired of using tools i don't trust and because i'm spending 99

36:24.280 --> 36:30.520
bucks on what so yeah we built this thing and it's it's legit so and i'm we're going to talk

36:30.520 --> 36:35.640
more about that um coming up and uh you know get into that but yeah keep going for sure we got some

36:35.640 --> 36:41.160
good questions so matthew says is it viable to try and snatch a few leads from fb groups to use also

36:41.160 --> 36:45.720
to close deals uh before ads take off i remember you did talk about this it's pretty hit or miss

36:45.720 --> 36:51.320
but can work what are your thoughts on it did you know what he's asking you cut out the first half

36:51.960 --> 36:56.840
is it viable to take going to facebook groups grab a few free leads and use those to go hook

36:56.840 --> 36:59.240
a deal and get the process going while you're waiting for ads

37:04.680 --> 37:10.840
can you repeat it sorry no you're you're good so like and uh the like facebook groups people ask

37:10.840 --> 37:16.040
for recommendations like hey who has a local concrete guy right can we use those leads those

37:16.040 --> 37:21.160
interested people as a form of free leads on our end to give to business owners while we're

37:21.160 --> 37:27.000
waiting for ads to take off or even to supplement them to get the deal i think so yeah nick you did

37:27.000 --> 37:33.480
a live on this or youtube video i think like last year the only thing i i like to use facebook group

37:33.480 --> 37:41.000
leads to pick up the slack i don't like to use them to start a deal usually sometimes i'll use

37:41.080 --> 37:46.920
them to hook a deal to test the market i don't love once i know the market's good to use them

37:46.920 --> 37:52.440
because then if my ads don't kick in it's like i don't have a predictable way to continually just

37:53.160 --> 37:58.280
scrape leads but if i'm running ads and my ads slow down it's a great way to go get like some

37:58.280 --> 38:05.400
sweat equity deals and go get some leads that way um so my opinion is hook them use those leads to

38:05.400 --> 38:09.560
get interest to gauge interest to call around to get somebody on the hook if you need to if you

38:09.560 --> 38:14.280
want to do that without setting up ads but i like to have my my leads coming in from ads and then

38:14.280 --> 38:19.960
use those as a supplement rather than my main thing because i don't i can't predict when people

38:19.960 --> 38:25.160
are going to ask for recommendations right um so that's just my two cents but leads are leads guys

38:25.160 --> 38:30.760
it's about strategy versus tactic the strategy is giving free leads in advance the tactic that

38:30.760 --> 38:35.480
we're using is is google ads but guess what if you guys can if somebody in this group can come up

38:35.480 --> 38:43.720
with a predictable um you know repeatable way to glean and and harvest leads out of facebook groups

38:44.280 --> 38:49.720
forever and we don't have to run ads go ahead and and hit me up on dms and we'll go ahead and

38:49.720 --> 38:53.640
implement that and stop running ads but ads is just the most predictable thing let me answer one more

38:53.640 --> 38:58.280
question and then what i want to do erin is i want you guys to finish out the questions i got to go

38:58.280 --> 39:01.880
take my kids to school really quick but i want you guys to finish these questions let me answer one

39:01.880 --> 39:05.640
more yeah i think that was actually all the questions the only thing i just want to actually

39:05.640 --> 39:09.960
give a shout out for is daniel said he has got a lot of newbie technical questions because he just

39:09.960 --> 39:13.640
um joined but he was hoping to have a little chitchat with someone to just kind of get on the

39:13.640 --> 39:18.680
right path so obviously daniel watch the training that's going to be like the 80 90 95 percent of

39:18.680 --> 39:23.160
all you need to know but actually jason already messaged he's going to hop on and chat with him

39:23.160 --> 39:27.800
so thank you jason the man everyone jason's been awesome i've probably been seeing him in the free

39:27.800 --> 39:33.080
group lately he's been killing it um guys wrapping this call up you're going to see it inside a

39:33.080 --> 39:38.680
kajabi you're going to see a digital resource going out um that kind of outlines this but i

39:38.680 --> 39:43.240
think the biggest takeaway for me if you have sites that are producing leads you guys have office

39:43.240 --> 39:48.760
space that's waiting to be rented out that costs you nothing to get a a tenant and you're you're

39:48.760 --> 39:53.400
you're flushing money down the toilet like you're literally wiping your behind with money and

39:53.400 --> 39:55.880
flushing it down the toilet it's just free money

39:58.920 --> 40:04.840
francesca let's go get let's go get saint george tree service locked down let's go i'm going to

40:04.840 --> 40:09.400
send you a picture of this we're going to look at this as well but before this the priority should

40:09.400 --> 40:14.200
be your your websites that already have leads coming in because it's done you just need to

40:14.200 --> 40:20.040
find a tenant boom you turn it on it's done it's free money so erin thank you for jumping on

40:20.040 --> 40:25.000
francesca thank you for jumping on guys let's go make some freaking money and i will see you guys

40:25.000 --> 40:31.240
later in the week going live or next tuesday thanks guys all right take care guys
