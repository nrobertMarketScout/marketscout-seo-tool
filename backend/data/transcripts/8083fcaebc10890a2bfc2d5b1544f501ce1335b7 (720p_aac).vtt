In one of your videos I watched recently, I believe you mentioned building out the website after they sign a six-month deal.

00:08.100 --> 00:14.100
So do you also build out the site if they sign a three-month contract as well, or do you wait until so?

00:14.100 --> 00:15.500
That's a good question, Bruce.

00:15.500 --> 00:18.500
I always build the site as soon as they sign the contract.

00:18.500 --> 00:24.200
Even if it's a three-month deal, I build it out unless it's a new niche, unless it's a niche that I've never done before.

00:24.200 --> 00:29.600
If it's like an excavation niche where I've never done it, I'm not building that site out until I've gone through one client.

00:29.600 --> 00:34.000
They've gone through the three or six months, they re-sign, then I'm going to build it out.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.400
But I don't know if that niche is going to hit, but if it's like a concrete niche or something like that, yeah, even a three month, I'm building that shit.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.600
I'm going to use the business owner's money to build it, and I'm going to build it right.
