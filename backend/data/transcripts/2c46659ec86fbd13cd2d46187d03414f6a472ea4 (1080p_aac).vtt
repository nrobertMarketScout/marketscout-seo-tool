00:00.000 --> 00:00.840
Let's go.

00:10.840 --> 00:14.240
Before you actually get started and start the modules

00:14.240 --> 00:16.500
and start picking niches and start going through everything

00:16.500 --> 00:18.300
and go, go, go, go, and I know you're anxious,

00:18.300 --> 00:20.100
I know you're excited, that's why we came here.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.820
That's why we are here.

00:21.820 --> 00:24.980
I want you to figure out a couple of things, okay?

00:24.980 --> 00:28.580
And I need you to figure out what is the destination?

00:28.580 --> 00:30.640
Where do you wanna go, okay?

00:30.640 --> 00:32.600
So when I say where do you wanna go,

00:32.600 --> 00:36.120
I mean how much money do you wanna make, okay?

00:36.120 --> 00:39.680
How much money do you wanna make within 12 months?

00:39.680 --> 00:42.820
Where do you wanna be by December 31st of this year?

00:42.820 --> 00:44.820
Where do you wanna be 12 months from now?

00:44.820 --> 00:47.600
Whatever that goal is, I wanna know where do you wanna be,

00:47.600 --> 00:50.520
AKA how much money do you wanna make, by what date?

00:50.520 --> 00:51.860
That's the first thing, okay?

00:51.860 --> 00:53.500
And you need to get really clear

00:53.500 --> 00:56.780
on how much money you wanna make.

00:56.780 --> 00:58.580
You need to know the destination.

00:58.580 --> 01:02.180
So let's just say you're sitting in the Midwest, okay?

01:02.180 --> 01:04.640
Maybe you're in Arkansas, maybe you're in Iowa,

01:04.640 --> 01:07.200
I don't know, whatever is classified as Midwest.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.440
And you wanna go to LA, okay?

01:10.440 --> 01:13.320
If you wanna go to LA, there's a lot of ways to go to LA.

01:13.320 --> 01:17.080
You could fly up to Portland and go down, you could fly.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.320
I mean, you could fly, first of all, you could drive,

01:19.320 --> 01:20.840
you could scooter, you could walk.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.680
There's a lot of different methods to get there,

01:22.680 --> 01:24.940
but there's also a lot of different ways.

01:24.940 --> 01:25.780
There's a lot of different routes.

01:25.780 --> 01:28.200
You could go down, go to Phoenix, right?

01:28.200 --> 01:29.440
There's a lot of ways, right?

01:29.440 --> 01:30.280
But guess what?

01:30.280 --> 01:33.160
There's one way that's the fastest.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.280
And so what I need you to do is, first of all,

01:36.280 --> 01:37.320
we gotta know the destination.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.700
We gotta know what you're aiming for,

01:38.700 --> 01:40.600
because if you don't know you wanna go to LA,

01:40.600 --> 01:42.480
you're gonna wander, okay?

01:42.480 --> 01:46.100
So I need you to know how much money do I wanna make

01:46.100 --> 01:47.400
and by what date?

01:47.400 --> 01:49.800
And it needs to be by a specific date.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.520
So we need to figure out what that is,

01:51.520 --> 01:53.520
and then we need to have a plan

01:53.520 --> 01:54.680
for how we're gonna get there.

01:54.680 --> 01:59.640
Meaning, okay, if I wanna get to $10,000 in six months,

01:59.640 --> 02:04.060
how many deals am I gonna need to do at what price per,

02:04.060 --> 02:06.860
like how much am I gonna need to charge the client

02:06.860 --> 02:09.060
at what profit margin?

02:09.060 --> 02:10.660
How am I gonna get to $10,000?

02:10.660 --> 02:12.660
Is it $10,000 profit?

02:12.660 --> 02:14.620
Is it $10,000 gross?

02:14.620 --> 02:16.300
I need you guys to figure out

02:16.300 --> 02:18.660
and get clear about what you want, okay?

02:18.660 --> 02:20.660
And so if you haven't already,

02:20.660 --> 02:25.320
I need you to go watch the video titled Exhausted,

02:25.320 --> 02:26.900
but Satisfied, and we will definitely,

02:26.900 --> 02:29.860
it will be linked somewhere around this video.

02:29.860 --> 02:31.940
I need you to watch this video,

02:31.940 --> 02:34.540
and I need you to set your destination,

02:34.540 --> 02:36.740
put a time on when you wanna get there,

02:36.740 --> 02:38.620
and then I need you to create a plan,

02:38.620 --> 02:41.460
AKA a map, for how you're gonna get there.

02:41.460 --> 02:43.620
And I want you to be so clear

02:43.620 --> 02:45.420
that if I were to come and scare you in the middle of night

02:45.420 --> 02:47.620
and shake you and say, hey, hey,

02:47.620 --> 02:49.700
what do you need to do today

02:49.700 --> 02:51.820
to get to your goal by Christmas,

02:51.820 --> 02:53.140
or to get to your goal that you set

02:53.140 --> 02:55.420
on December 31st, New Year's Eve?

02:55.420 --> 02:56.420
What do you need to do today?

02:56.420 --> 02:58.060
And I want you to be able to go, oh my gosh,

02:58.060 --> 02:59.820
I need to set up this many campaigns,

02:59.820 --> 03:01.540
and I need to talk to this many business owners,

03:01.540 --> 03:03.060
and I need to close out this percentage,

03:03.060 --> 03:03.900
and I need to do this.

03:03.900 --> 03:05.980
I want you to know so clearly

03:05.980 --> 03:07.860
that I can wake you up in a dead sleep,

03:07.860 --> 03:09.780
and you know exactly what you need to do.

03:09.780 --> 03:12.700
Because guys, the problem with most people

03:12.700 --> 03:15.660
is that they spend a crazy amount of time,

03:15.660 --> 03:17.520
majority of their time on activities

03:18.420 --> 03:20.480
that do not get them closer to their goals, okay?

03:20.480 --> 03:22.480
And they do not move the needle.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.400
And so before we get going,

03:24.400 --> 03:27.520
I need you guys to set the destination,

03:27.520 --> 03:29.560
put a timeframe on that,

03:29.560 --> 03:32.000
and create a map of how we're gonna get there.
