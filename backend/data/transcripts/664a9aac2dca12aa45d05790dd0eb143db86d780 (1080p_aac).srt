1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
If you don't have a deal and you're in the middle of like trying to,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,160
you got somebody hooked and you're trying to close a deal. Now I'm asking Jeff,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,720
what would be your recommendations there?

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,440
Right. Yeah. I think your first one about if you have a BO,

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,720
just let them know and talk to them. That's the best thing. I've gone over this.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,800
I believe it was in the, the last live that I did,

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,240
where you can start manipulating some of the keyword themes,

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,240
because some of them are going to be more expensive than others. And so some,

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,560
you know, the keyword themes are all really broad matched.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,560
And so what you may find, if you go back through your,

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,440
your research and your due diligence, you might find certain,

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,920
like a volume of keywords with a lower CPC versus a higher

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,560
volume with the highest CPC.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,960
And you can start manipulating and maybe removing a keyword theme or two and

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,440
hitting refresh and see if that gets your budget lower so that you can still

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,320
kind of get some leads coming in while you're trying to get someone on the hook

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,200
and someone or why you're, you know,

18
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,560
why you're trying to get that business owner on a hook and land a deal.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
So that's definitely a way you can try to stay in a market,

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,120
but just remember like up here, like this is now not a thousand dollar a month

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,360
deal.

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,800
This might be a $2,000 a month deal because I want to turn the ads back on for

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,560
the bigger CPC, but that's definitely a technique.

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,560
Several of you that I've helped out in the last couple of weeks, that's,

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,440
that's been, that's been very helpful.

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,280
And you've been able to keep getting ads and you've been able to stay, you know,

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,440
18 to 23, $24 a day in a market that if you were going for the main

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,080
keyword, you're looking at like almost $40 a day.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,640
So that that's how I would get around it. It's a little,

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,080
I know it's confusing to say here, but the last live that I did,

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,120
where we recorded it, I demonstrated how to do that.
