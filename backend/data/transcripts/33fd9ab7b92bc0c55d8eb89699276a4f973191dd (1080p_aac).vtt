Jerry says, if you do not, if you do comment on quote, not so

00:04.200 --> 00:07.920
niche relevant websites, but with good metrics, can it somehow

00:07.920 --> 00:11.880
backfire and make uncle Google confused about what topic your

00:11.880 --> 00:14.400
website really is about? What are your thoughts on that,

00:14.400 --> 00:14.880
Eugene?

00:16.320 --> 00:19.800
I mean, like, like I said, you know, we're, we're really, we're

00:19.800 --> 00:23.000
really at a very, no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say that.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.380
No, I mean, I think Google is smart enough at this point to

00:26.380 --> 00:29.880
know like what your content is. And, you know, I've seen like,

00:30.120 --> 00:33.520
probably thousands of websites getting backlinks this kind of

00:33.520 --> 00:37.200
like this way, right? So like, I don't, you know, I don't think

00:37.200 --> 00:40.520
that's going to be issue. The only issue is, it's really just

00:40.520 --> 00:44.040
going to be like, it's not going to be as effective as if you can

00:44.040 --> 00:48.120
get a relevant backlink from a good website, right? But, but

00:48.120 --> 00:51.560
yeah, I mean, we do it all the time. And, you know, we don't

00:51.560 --> 00:56.080
have any penalty problems or miss indexing problems or

00:56.080 --> 00:56.800
anything like that.

00:56.960 --> 01:01.080
I think it's more if you get the relevancy, it's going to help.

01:01.120 --> 01:04.200
If you don't, it's not going to help, but it's not going to hurt

01:04.200 --> 01:05.680
you, because I know how I would look at it.
