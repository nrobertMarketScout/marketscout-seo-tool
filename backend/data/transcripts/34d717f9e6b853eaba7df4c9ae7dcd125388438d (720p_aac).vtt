I want to remind you guys that as we're getting into SEO,

00:03.200 --> 00:05.120
as we're talking about SEO questions, and by the way,

00:08.480 --> 00:15.120
this is the part after you get the deal and I've had this question asked like,

00:15.120 --> 00:20.400
can you not build a website? Can we just have the one pager? Can we have the ads running the

00:20.400 --> 00:26.240
one pager and we charge a thousand and we spend 500 and take the difference? Yes, we can. I've done

00:26.240 --> 00:31.520
it. I did it on accident and I've made money for a whole year, made whatever, $600, $6,000 net,

00:31.520 --> 00:37.440
because it was $1,500, made 500 bucks a month times 12, $6,000 net, didn't even know. Yes,

00:37.440 --> 00:46.080
you can. However, I would highly, highly, highly, highly encourage you that once you get the deal

00:46.720 --> 00:50.560
and you get enough deals that your bills are covered and you are like, okay, now it's time

00:50.640 --> 00:56.320
to go and build these properties that you take the profits and you actually go and build the

00:56.320 --> 01:04.720
properties because this is the part that makes the business model really sexy. The business

01:04.720 --> 01:09.360
model is sexy even if you just do the arbitrage, thousand bucks a month, 500 and ads take the

01:09.360 --> 01:15.360
difference, but it becomes really sexy if it's a thousand bucks a month that you're getting paid

01:15.360 --> 01:22.560
and you can turn the ads to a hundred bucks a month or to 50 bucks a month or completely off

01:22.560 --> 01:32.080
and you can make 90 plus percent profit margin. This is another thing that's so dope about SEO

01:32.080 --> 01:39.520
is it mitigates your risk. If we're only relying on ads and all of our leads are coming from ads

01:39.520 --> 01:45.760
and then something changes with ads, we're screwed. What I recommend is if Google has

01:45.760 --> 01:51.040
a way to get leads, let's try to tap into all. Let's try to get leads from ads. Let's get leads

01:51.040 --> 01:57.200
from GMB and let's get leads from the organic. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.400
We need to be getting all of this special delivery, thank you, of the monster. I told

02:02.400 --> 02:05.360
my wife to bring this thing up because you just never know when I'm going to need that. Thank you.

02:05.360 --> 02:10.320
Thank you. We want to mitigate our risk. We want to have leads coming in from ads,

02:10.320 --> 02:14.640
we want to have leads coming in from GMB and from organic. For those of you that are freaking out

02:14.640 --> 02:21.200
going, oh my gosh, I haven't got any GMB, blah, blah, blah. Guys, I've gotten tons and tons and

02:21.200 --> 02:28.960
tons of deals where all I had was organic leads coming in. No GMB, no ads, but again, if we can

02:28.960 --> 02:34.880
get leads coming in from all three different areas, it mitigates our risk. Number one is that.

02:35.600 --> 02:41.440
Number two, this is the last thing that I wanted to cover is with SEO. Number one, make sure that

02:41.440 --> 02:47.200
we do build the website because that's what changes it from a great business model to an ultra sexy,

02:47.200 --> 02:53.440
the best business model with the highest profit margins with low risk. We mitigate our risk.

02:53.440 --> 02:58.080
We secure ourselves in those positions and we keep our clients. Make sure we build those websites.
