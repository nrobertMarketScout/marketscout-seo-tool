Kareem says, is it a bad idea to mention the contract on the video call before

00:02.880 --> 00:08.160
the call? I typically don't because I don't want to like over make this a big

00:08.160 --> 00:12.780
deal guys. Sales, as soon as people feel about buying pressure, then all of a

00:12.780 --> 00:15.460
sudden they want to throw their hands up and they don't want, you know, they

00:15.460 --> 00:18.260
want to do it. And so sometimes what happens is we start bringing stuff up

00:18.260 --> 00:20.880
too quick. We start dropping price, we start dropping contract, we start

00:20.880 --> 00:24.620
dropping this and that and the rest on our first call and we lose the deal.

00:25.620 --> 00:32.780
I, sorry. Go ahead. I also, I never call it a contract. I say after he already

00:32.780 --> 00:37.980
said he agrees, I say, okay, I'm going to send you this exclusivity agreement so

00:37.980 --> 00:41.820
you know that I'm only working with you and it's going to stay that on there.

00:41.820 --> 00:48.220
Like take it a lot, make it sound a lot more easy. Then I don't, I never say hey,

00:48.220 --> 00:53.020
sign this contract for six months because that usually scares them. Yeah.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.940
But if you do, it's all about how you say it, right? If you want to, sometimes

00:56.940 --> 01:00.140
I'll say it. I don't care because I'm going to look and go, yeah, there's just

01:00.140 --> 01:04.420
like, is there a contract? Yeah, of course. Obviously, like imagine, imagine

01:04.420 --> 01:08.580
I'm committing to you exclusively. I'm not going to go look for any other

01:08.580 --> 01:11.660
business owners, but you can just cancel anytime. That sounds like a one sided

01:11.660 --> 01:14.340
marriage. That doesn't sound like it's going to work. Obviously, you need to

01:14.340 --> 01:16.860
commit to me for six months. How are we going to judge this off one month? Like

01:16.860 --> 01:20.020
I make it so obvious. Like, of course there's a contract, bro. Did you buy

01:20.180 --> 01:23.340
your cell phone out right? No, of course you didn't. Did you buy your car right?

01:23.340 --> 01:28.460
No, probably not. Just how it is. We do six month agreement, you know? So it

01:28.460 --> 01:32.220
depends. Now you can phrase it whatever. It doesn't matter. And I like what you

01:32.220 --> 01:36.020
say as well, Francesca, but you, if you're going to say it, be confident.

01:36.020 --> 01:40.020
Yeah, of course. Of course there's a contract, bro. I mean, it's a one month

01:40.020 --> 01:44.220
deal and you just freaking get a pick and choose and then go have tea and

01:44.220 --> 01:46.420
crumpets. Come on, bro. You know?
