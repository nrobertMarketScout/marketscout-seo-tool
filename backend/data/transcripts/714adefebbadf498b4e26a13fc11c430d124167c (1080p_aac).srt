1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,400
Alright guys, let's go ahead and close the deal.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,640
So as we talked about in the last lesson, once we get through, we're going to finish

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,360
off the shit sandwich, which is we're going to end on a positive note before we go for

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,360
the close, right?

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,660
So the bun, which is good, the shit, which is the price, which they can view as a negative.

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,820
And then the bun, which is good, and then the price.

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,580
So remember, shit sandwich should be pretty easy to remember, right?

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,500
So what I do right before I ask for the deals, I lay out everything that they get, okay?

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,380
So I like to look at all the things and separate them, all the stuff that they get.

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,060
So I'm going to go, alright, so let me just tell you, just so we're on the same page,

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,940
Mr. Business Owner, this is what's included in the deal, okay?

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,860
So first thing is, it's 100% exclusive, okay?

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,660
Like I'm not sending these to anybody else.

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,580
As long as you're working with me, you're working with me.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,220
Nobody else in this area, okay?

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,660
Or concrete, okay?

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,060
We also get, you also get the tracking number on the website.

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,220
Guys, I know that you're like, no, that's a no-brainer, but guys, if you separate each

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,060
of these pieces, think about, I think Alex Hormozi talks about this in his book.

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,300
You separate all of these individual pieces.

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,380
If they were to do a tracking number with just a regular service like CallRail, I think

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,580
it's like 50 bucks to do a basic plan, right?

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,020
So it's a $50 a month value.

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,020
So I'm adding that.

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,640
So I'm going to go back into it.

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,980
So we also get the tracking number option, which it's really cool because, not the option,

27
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,980
sorry.

28
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,820
We also get the tracking number on the website, which is super cool because we can forward

29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,980
this directly to your number, which is what we're going to do.

30
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,820
And it's going to give you a whisper message to you.

31
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,460
You'll know exactly what calls are coming from this website.

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,220
Plus it's going to record everything and we have a bunch of other capabilities.

33
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,580
Like if we want to do a round robin or let's say you don't answer because you're on a job,

34
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,740
we can then send it to your secretary or your sales guy.

35
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,140
Like there's a lot of cool stuff with that.

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,620
So you also get the tracking number.

37
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,900
It doesn't cost you any additional money.

38
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,780
And then I'll let them know and you get access to our dashboard.

39
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,940
And I'm thinking in my head, CallRail, right?

40
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,940
And you can let them know.

41
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,700
So with the dashboard, you're going to be able to log in and view all the recorded calls.

42
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,700
You're going to be able to see the call flow.

43
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,620
You're going to be able to check out the leads.

44
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:21,060
You'll have your own login to our platform, which again is CallRail.

45
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,620
Then I will mention, I'll say, Hey, we also, not only are we going to be ranking in the

46
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,740
organic section for the actual website, but we're also, and I'm going to need your help

47
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,560
a little bit with this, but we're also going to be able to get in that map section.

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,580
So we're going to build out a map listing that goes hand in hand with this.

49
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,940
You're going to get all the leads that come from that as well.

50
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,040
And there's companies out there, Mr. Business Center, they only do that.

51
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,200
So they'll charge you just to manage that.

52
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,880
So we're going to do that as part of our deal.

53
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,680
And don't guys, don't make this sound like they're going to get that as their own.

54
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,840
This is part of the lead gen deal, but just let them know they get the leads from that

55
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
as well.

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Okay.

57
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
So yeah, we're going to do that.

58
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,260
It's called GMB or I guess it's a Google, it's GBP, Google Business Profiles.

59
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,320
And probably when you watch this, it's going to be something else, right?

60
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,360
We're going to optimize that, put pictures and stuff.

61
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,840
We're probably going to need a little bit of help, but all the leads that come from

62
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,200
that you're going to get as well.

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Okay.

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
So we will handle all that.

65
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
I am going to need you to help me with an address.

66
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,120
We'll talk about that in a minute.

67
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,180
And then here's the last thing is I'm going to give you first right of refusal on any

68
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,740
deals that we do in the area.

69
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,480
So like with Queen Creek, we're using that example.

70
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,360
So for example, Mr. Business Owner, like if I decide that we want to expand into Mesa,

71
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,400
before I go and just call another business owner that's your competitor, I'm going to

72
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
come to you first.

73
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,040
Then I'm going to say, Hey, Brian, do you have any interest in Mesa?

74
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,920
And you're going to have the opportunity to jump on and sign for that deal before anybody

75
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,680
else before I even talked to anybody else.

76
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
Okay.

77
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,760
Just so you know, that is teeing them up.

78
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,800
First of all, you're including it as a bonus or as a good advantage that comes with it,

79
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,840
which it is, but also you're teeing them up to say, Hey, this guy's looking to expand.

80
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,880
And when you hit them up and say, Hey, remember how I told you, I give you first right of

81
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
refusal?

82
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
Yep.

83
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,880
I'm going into Mesa.

84
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
Do you want any leads there?

85
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,160
And you automatically have them teed up to get second money, third money, fourth money

86
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
on these deals.

87
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
Guys, you see how brilliant this is, right?

88
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Completely laid out perfectly.

89
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,160
Okay.

90
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
We are going to ask for the deal.

91
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
And here's how I do it.

92
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,600
I use what's called an assumption clause and it's actually kind of an assumption slash

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
option.

94
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
And so what an assumption clause is, and I know some of you guys have been in sales and

95
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,120
you're like, Oh my gosh, Nick, this is very basic.

96
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,520
An assumption clause.

97
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,400
It means you're assuming the sale.

98
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,600
You're assuming the deal.

99
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,560
So guys, what I'll do is I'll end, I'll mention all of the good things, right?

100
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,480
And then a high note, and then I'll just be really smooth and say, cool.

101
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,720
So all I got to do and I'll search around for my pen.

102
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Like you could see me naturally.

103
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
I'll grab my pen or whatever.

104
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,760
I'll be like, let me grab my pen.

105
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,520
So all I got to do to get you guys, or to get you going is grab a card from you.

106
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,360
Are you an Amex or a Visa?

107
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Okay.

108
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,680
And I'll just look down like I'm writing or I'll look right at the screen or I'll grab

109
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
my pen.

110
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,080
Like I'm getting ready to write down the number and I'll wait.

111
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,280
Are you an Amex or a Visa?

112
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,720
Okay, wait.

113
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,720
And I'm telling you right now, if you've done the setup correctly and if you've done all

114
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,040
the steps correctly and you've sent the leads the way that we've taught and you've, you've

115
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,840
prospected the right person, you've done all of those things, it is going to shock you

116
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,040
when they go, give me one second.

117
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,120
Let me grab my card.

118
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,480
And you're going, oh my gosh, is this happening?

119
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Oh my gosh.

120
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Oh my gosh.

121
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Brain.

122
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,160
And you just don't get too excited.

123
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,840
I remember the first couple of times this happened to me, I started talking too much.

124
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
I was like, cool.

125
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,840
Yeah.

126
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
Sounds good.

127
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,560
So man, the other cool thing is this, the other cool thing is it's like, just relax.

128
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
Okay.

129
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Just act like you do this every day.

130
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Okay.

131
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,920
And the first time you do this, you're like, holy shit, I just got this deal, baby.

132
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
Let's go.

133
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,600
And you want to fist bump, save it till the zoom calls off.

134
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Okay.

135
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Just be calm.

136
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
So yeah, no problem.

137
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,160
I'm actually just going to get everything set up while you're doing that.

138
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,960
And you're over there just biting your nails.

139
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,260
They're going to give you the card.

140
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,820
You're going to, and here's what you're going to do.

141
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,560
If you get the deal right here, and in the next video, we're going to talk briefly about

142
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
objections.

143
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,240
But if you get the deal right here, which you will more often than not, if you do this

144
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,240
correctly.

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Okay.

146
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,680
And like, I'm talking most of the time.

147
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,440
What I would recommend you doing is just writing the information down and that's going

148
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,400
to lead us to two videos from here where I'm going to show you how to set this up in Stripe

149
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,520
or into another merchant account, whatever, but you're just going to write down their

150
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,080
credit card information, their code on the back, their expiration date, their first and

151
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,360
last name and their zip code on a piece of paper.

152
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,800
That's the easiest way to do it because I know some people where they're like, let me

153
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
send you an invoice.

154
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,240
I just asked them for the credit card.

155
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,160
I'm going to write the damn thing down on a piece of paper and I'm going to go set

156
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
it up.

157
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Okay.

158
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,360
So right there, if you've done it correctly, you're going to get the deal.

159
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,720
And if you guys have skipped a step, you're going to find out and you're, they're going

160
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,040
to go, yeah, Nick, like, yeah, haha, that's smooth, man.

161
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
Haha.

162
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
I like that.

163
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Right.

164
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Some of them are going to say that they're going to go.

165
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
So here's what I'm going to do.

166
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
And you're like, oh, here we go.

167
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,880
And they're going to say, so I'm going to give me about a day.

168
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,680
I'm going to talk to my, my spouse or I'm going to talk to my partner and, and I'll

169
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
let you know.

170
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,880
And all of a sudden, as they start saying it, you go, oh shoot, I forgot about the partner.

171
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
Okay.

172
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,320
And that leads us into the video that we're going to talk about next, which is about objections.
