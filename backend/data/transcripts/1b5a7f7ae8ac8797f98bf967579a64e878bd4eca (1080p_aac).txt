If you don't have your first deal, if you don't have enough money to pay your
bills, I want you sticking in tried and true.
I want you to be getting those first deals in fencing, in masonry, in
concrete, in tree service, in whatever, because you don't have to worry about
the niche once you get to a point where your bills are paid, once you get to a
point where, um, you like are comfortable enough that you're not worried about
losing a dollar, some of you are in that spot, then we could start getting tricky,
but I don't think it's bad or a waste of time at all to be actively talking
about different niche ideas.
