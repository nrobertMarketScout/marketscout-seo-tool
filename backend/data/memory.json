    "content": "The transcribed files discuss the rank and rent model but don't explicitly provide a step-by-step breakdown of the sales process. However, some steps can be inferred:\n\n1. Niche Selection — identify and choose a profitable niche, considering factors such as seasonality and potential demand.\n\n2. Website Creation — build a website relevant to the chosen niche. The aim is to create a site that generates leads so that businesses in the chosen niche would want to rent the site.\n\n3. SEO Optimization — apply SEO strategies to rank the website high in search engine results. This process may take several months.\n\n4. Lead Generation — once the website is ranking and generating leads, collect these leads as proof of performance.\n\n5. Pre-Selling the Site — the expert mentions selling the website first and then building it on the backend. This might involve finding interested clients first, convincing them of the potential value, and then customizing the site according to their needs.\n\n6. Rent the Website — once you are generating leads through the website and have interested clients, you can rent the website to them. Typically, the clients will pay a monthly fee for keeping the website and using the leads it generates.\n\nBear in mind that the process inferred from the transcription may differ from the actual process that the reference rank and rent SEO expert uses. The actual process may require additional steps or may not include all these steps.",
