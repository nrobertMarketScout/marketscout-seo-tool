## ðŸ§­ Overview

This tool is used for internal research to determine:
- Which local service niches have viable search traffic
- Where competition is weak or missing
- What city + keyword combos present strong opportunity for building lead-gen assets

The tool processes input CSVs of niche/location pairs, then runs automated analysis using:
- Search volume and CPC data via **Google Ads API**
- Competitor listings via **Google Maps / Local Pack**
- Organic SERP results via **SerpAPI**
- Internal scoring logic to calculate opportunity level (High, Medium, Low)

Example use:
Keyword: "Concrete Contractor"
Location: "Portland, OR"
â†’ Result: 260 monthly searches, $4.25 CPC, weak competition
â†’ Score: High opportunity
